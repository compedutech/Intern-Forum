9kc0n0,11,2018-09-30,In a dark place,Kal947,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9kc0n0/in_a_dark_place/,"I'm 24 and the past 5 years that have been the most painful I have ever endured. In all this time I have suffered in my own personal living hell. Horrific anxiety, hopelessness, failing at everything I cared about. Depression is likely situational and I honestly believe if my situation changes for the better then it would be gone. I no longer believe the things I want most in this life are possible anymore. More than anything, I want love but there are so very many things that keep me from having it.

I probably have something along the lines of avoidant personality disorder or social anxiety disorder or a mix of both. It makes life very difficult to live. I will avoid social gatherings at all costs and even when I try and fight my fears and introduce myself to someone (anyone) new, even when we get along, I will feel a need to avoid them in the next time we see each other. This makes it impossible to form the relationships I want in life. In work I am pathetic not being able to do the people facing part of my job which is basically the whole damn job. IT in the beginning is very people facing and when I do have a job or internship in my case, I have no motivation in work either even though I did go every day despite injuries I had at the time. I have no motivation anymore to try in school either having to take multiple breaks because of mental issues. I'm almost done but I'm afraid I might fail.

If I could have the affection and love that I so desperately want and need, life would be livable and I could face every hardship with a smile. But I don't have that and the girl of my dreams will likely never want me back. Even if she did I'm in a bad situation at present and it remains to be seen if I'll ever get out. I live with my parents and I have no job as of yet but even if I got a job I'd do terribly at it and probably get fired because of my problems. A large part of me does not care anymore what happens to me and simply wants to give up on everything. I think a day will come when I cannot take it anymore and simply commit suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I begin reviewing the show proper, I want to preface this with two talking points that I feel are important. Well, one's important. (1) For those of you who were used to the commentary team of Tony Schiavone, Mike Tenay and Bobby Heenan... Sorry, but that doesn't happen for quite some time. Heenan is here, but he's joined instead by Eric Bischoff – not yet outed as the boss, nor the nWo heel we remember him as, here he's just basically a living talking Ken doll who is only programmed to say “Hulk Hogan!” - and Steve “Mongo” McMichael – a former football player who is basically the white version of Percy Watson on commentary: very excited and tries his best to get things over and make the matches meaningful but no, he's not very good at this. The upgrade to the commentary team we're all familiar with might be The Greatest Upgrade in The History Of Our Great Sport, and is sure to put some butts in the seats, ahem. (2) Actual important fact: if you didn't live through this era of wrestling, you might not realize what a game changer Nitro actually was. Up until this point, both WWF (with Raw, Superstars, and whatever other syndicated shows they had going on) and WCW (with Worldwide and Saturday Night) were operating under a similar formula: jobber squashes and wrestling for the sake of wrestling where you'd get the odd angle to help build towards the next PPV, and if you're lucky you'd MAYBE get one marquee match of note. Nitro said “nuts to that formula, we want to present a show that is both a good wrestling product AND a good tv product” and went full on hotshot mode, giving us a wrestling show that's closer to what we have today: a product that is just jam packed with hot angles and meaningful matches more often than not. So bear that in mind as you read, and remember that even when I'm sh-tting on some of the more Hogan oriented main event stuff, this sh-t was revolutionary for its time. Enough so that it (eventually) forced the WWE to change the way THEY approached wrestling shows in order to compete. One final note: both Nitro and Raw (which I'll get to cover next week, as Nitro debuted on a week where Raw was pre-empted) were in the glory days of only being one hour long shows, and you have NO idea how sad I will be once that changes.

\-Before our first match kicks off, we get a brief intro with our commentary team (which is how many Nitros started, so I won't point it out going forward unless something noteworthy happens), and Bischoff's mission statement is made clear right from his introduction: “We got a lot of great action coming your way, the WCW World champion Hulk Hogan will be in action in the main event!” The first of many times where Hogan will be the clear focus of everything.

1. JUSHIN “THUNDER” LIGER VS FLYIN' BRIAN PILLMAN If the mere act of reading the above competitors didn't catch your attention and make you stoked, you clearly didn't grow up watching WCW in the 90's. Both men have had tremendous matches against each other in the past – really next level sh-t as far as cruiserweight action goes, almost like the Southern rasslin version of Dynamite Kid vs the original Sayama version of Tiger Mask – and while this one doesn't quite live up to their past encounters, it's still the best possible way to kick off your new wrestling tv show. It's only slightly hampered by three real minor but unfortunate things: (1) At the moment, Pillman just seems like a man without direction as a character. He's just recently coming off of his incredible heel run teaming with Stunning Steve Austin as the Hollywood Blondes, here he's back to being a whitemeat babyface (remember that in the upcoming weeks) with no real motivation or personality to speak of. (2) Liger is just coming off of a bad injury, he had broken his leg something fierce in a match against... I believe it was The Great Sasuke, and seems more than a little tentative when going to the high flying well, which is understandable but unfortunate. It's noticeable enough that the commentary team even points it out a few times, and they usually don't give two sh-ts about any non-Hogan thing going on. (3) Like most (if not all) of the Japanese wrestlers we'll see showing up on Nitro over the next few years, whoever's in charge of entrance music went “Japanese guy, huh?” and just gave him the most stereotype “ching ching chong chong” sounding music possible. I'm 99% sure that this exact music gets repurposed for other Japanese wrestlers later down the line. That being said, it's still Jushin \*\*\*\*ing Liger vs Brian \*\*\*\*ing Pillman, it's still fast paced and exciting, and is 100 times better than anything you'll see on Raw, or on the WCW main event scene. And the cruiserweight action only gets better from here. The finish absolutely comes out of nowhere, with Pillman countering an attempted German Suplex with a Victory Roll and getting the 3 count. Like I said above, this wasn't up to either man's usual standard, but excellent match to kick off the show, and like so many other cruiserweight undercard matches in Nitro history, the episode peaked here, I'd say. But don't worry, we got a lot of great action for you, Hulk Hogan is going to be in the main event! Because when I think of the word “inaction”, I think of Hogan. No, I didn't intend to put a space between “in” and “action”. RESULTS: Brian Pillman def. Jushin Liger via pinfall

\-And now we see the REAL reason Nitro 1 is occurring in the Mall of America: we get a coke fueled rambling promo from Hogan that takes place at Pastamania, a HULK HOGAN SH-T PASTA RESTAURANT at the Mall! Yes, this is a thing that happened Soupies! Hulk basically just rambles about how eating his sub-Chef Boyardee Pastamania food has given him extra special strength to beat Big Bubba later tonight. And when he's done beating Bubba, he's going to feed him some Pastamania crap and then bodyslam him again for good measure. I wish I was making any of this up.

2) RIC FLAIR VS STING Fun fact about this one: We didn't know it then obviously, but Flair vs Sting would go on to be kind of a bookend for the Nitro series. It featured here on the debut, and – 17 year old spoiler alert – it would also feature on the final Nitro. It wasn't the first and last paragraphs of the show's story, but the match happened in the first and final chapters, and there's something beautiful about that in a weird way. Before the match starts, the first of two minorly overbooked moments occurs: LEX LUGER shows up to briefly watch the proceedings! Before you start thinking I've lost my mind for marking out over Luger, bear one thing in mind: up until this moment, Luger had been working for the WWF. His contract lapsed around this time, and Sting managed to convince Bischoff (who by his own admission wasn't a Luger fan) to sign him out from under Vince without anyone noticing. So yeah, shots fired much? As far as Sting vs Flair matches go, it's hardly their best effort, but is still damn good wrestling and let's face it, I don't think Sting and Flair were capable of having a bad match against each other. The sheer combination of their in ring ability, their chemistry, and the fact that they've probably wrestled each other hundreds of time means that these two could probably literally sleepwalk their way through a 3 star match. Ultimately, all of this is a means to an end anyway, and leads up to the minorly overbooked finish that is going to require an explanation for anyone who knows Horseman history: Arn Anderson (who is scheduled to face Flair at the upcoming Fall Brawl PPV) makes his way out to watch the match, and once Flair has Sting in the Figure Four, and is grabbing the ropes in full view of the referee (who tries counting him out several times without, you know, calling the match), he enters the ring and pulls Flair's arms away from the ropes. Note that the ref calls for the bell as soon as Arn enters, before any physical contact is made, and I don't know if he's disqualifying Flair for his rope shenanigans, or if he's just stupid and thinks “Arn entering the ring and doing nothing = DQ!” Flair tries throwing hands with Arn, but he gets punched in the face in return, and the two brawl back to the locker room. Anderson returns after this, and it looks like he's out to get Sting but no, he's just here to grab his jacket and leave. I probably don't need to explain this to you, but Arn \*\*\*\*ing rules! What I DO need to explain, however, is this feud which began shortly before Nitro started. As I understand it, tensions occurred between the two former Horsemen (FYI, the Horsemen are no longer a thing here. For now.) based around Arn deciding that he'd rather spend time with his wife and family than continue the Ric Flair party lifestyle, and Flair having absolutely NONE of that. Wow, that didn't need as much explanation as I thought! RESULTS: Sting def. Ric Flair via DQ

\-Immediately after the match, it's trouble at the announce table as Scott “Flash” Norton shows up and creates a scene. Norton, for those who haven't seen him, is a massive, strong as sh\*t former arm wrestling champion who is just coming off a strong run in All Japan, and although he never becomes a major thing in WCW, he is \*\*\*\*ing dope. He's out here looking for some competition, and in a hilarious bit of Bobby Heenan greatness, Heenan pretty much accidentally outs Bischoff as the guy running the show (without using those words) and absolutely throws Eric under the bus, awesome! Mongo gets in his face to accept the challenge – hah, like they'd ever make an untrained football player like HIM into a wrestler! (spoiler alert: they do) – but it's the Macho Man Randy Savage who ACTUALLY makes the save and challenges Norton to a match. The two try to get into the ring and do this RIGHT NOW, but in a move that is SO \*\*\*\*ING REFRESHING after years of watching WWE matches get booked on the fly, Bischoff says “Nope, you two haven't signed a contract to wrestle, this isn't happening tonight!' and has security remove Norton from ringside! It's such a minor thing, but how \*\*\*\*ing great is that?!?!?! One ting that WCW largely (pre-Russo era at least) did so much better than the WWF was to at least give the appearance that they were a legitimate sporting company, and it really is a minor detail that makes a major difference in the suspense of disbelief.

\-Did you know that Sabu had a cup of coffee run in WCW? Well he did, and we're introduced to him here through a trippy, LSD hazy video package! SO MUCH AFTERIMAGES GOING ON!

\-One last non-wrestling bit before we get to the main event: We're introduced to Michael Wallstreet by way of pre-recorded promo. For those who don't know, Wallstreet is Mike Rotunda, former IRS, current father of Bray Wyatt and Bo Dallas. He cuts an extremely tongue in cheek wink wink “I'm shooting!” promo playing with insider knowledge to a small degree, mocking “The New Generation” (which was the WWF's mission statement at the time), and saying that “the IRS is watching him”, because GET IT?!?!?!?!

3) MAIN EVENT – NON-TITLE MATCH: BIG BUBBA ROGERS VS HULK HOGAN (W/ JIMMY HART)(C.) It's a Hulk Hogan match, do I really need to say anything here? Hulk Hogan vs Big Bubba is essentially Hulk Hogan vs anyone: Hogan controls with the world's sh-ttiest looking offense in the most kicky punchy WWF style match possible, the heel gets the advantage after cheating him somehow, until Hulk gets hit with the heel's biggest signature move or finish, at which point he says “NOPE!”, heals himself to 100% HP, hits his sh-tty Big Boot and sh-tty Leg Drop and wins. There, I've saved myself a lot of time and reviewed 99% of Hogan's WCW matches for you right here. Here, Hogan falls pray to a poke to the eye, so that Bubba can actually get some offense in. Which, you know, only serves the purpose of allowing Hogan to negate that damage later. Hulk also THREATENS TO PUNCH THE REF at one point when he was admonished for excessive ground and point, because BABYFACE! Why did any of us like this \*\*\*\*ing piece of sh-t again?!?!?! He also gets Jimmy Hart to distract the ref so he can wrap Bubba's head in the American flag and I can't even with this cheating d-ckbag anymore, what the \*\*\*\*? The Hulk Hogan Frustrating No Sell Moment comes after Bubba hits him with the Bossman Slam, which I remind you is his \*\*\*\*ING FINISH, Hogan moves follow, and SOMEHOW Hogan picks up the win. Somehow. RESULTS: Hulk Hogan def. Big Bubba via pinfall

\-Post match, Kevin Sullivan and the DUNGEON OF DOOM swarm the ring to attack, and I have been waiting a LONG TIME to talk about these morons! Basically, Sullivan's mission statement was to destroy Hogan, and he felt that the best way to do so was to gather the most cartoony, hokey cartoon character villains possible and form the most low budget version of his old Florida territory quasi-Satanic cult possible. Here he is joined by Meng, Kamala, The Zodiac (Brutus the \*\*\*\*ing Barber Beefcake in weird face paint), and The Shark, who was Avalanche just a few months earlier and lost a no DQ match to Randy Savage by DQ. Luger of all people shows up to the make the save, and after they clear the ring, they bump into each other and almost slug it out, because WCW babyfaces are just as terrible as WWE babyfaces I guess. Hogan tells Luger to “go back from where you came from”, and while I know he means the WWF, that statement is EXTREMELY CONCERNING given what we know of Hogan's current views on race relations. Or at least his current views while he's in the middle of recording a sex tape with his friend's wife. Savage and Sting show up to diffuse the situation, and a challenge is laid out: Luger is here because he wants a shot at Hogan's title. Hogan accepts the challenge in the most “oops, I have no idea what I'm talking about” manner possible, assuring him “You don't have to wait a week, you don't have to wait a month, next week it'll be you and me for the WCW World title!” So... in other words he has to wait a week? OOPS!

NIELSON RATINGS: 2.5, which is pretty decent for a debut episode, this is around what the WWF was pulling for tv ratings at this time, on average.

HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: I may have disparaged it a bit compared to their past work, but Pillman vs Liger in a heartbeat. You had to know that was coming, right? LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: Speaking of “you had to know that was coming, right?”, Hogan vs Bubba, easily. It wasn't the worst match ever or anything, but it was so typical Hogan horsesh-t, and honestly Hogan pulling this sh-t and nerfing all of my favorite WCW guys was the reason why I stopped watching the product in '94 in the first place, and didn't start watching Nitro until 6 or 7 months in, when Hall made his shocking debut.

NEXT WEEK: WCW and WWF go head to head for the first time! Nitro continues its trend of giving us exciting cruiserweight matches, marquee match ups, and a main event scene that is hot garbage but at least tries to be meaningful. To counter this, the WWF gives us more squash matches, and long, boring rest hold filled snooze fests. For the next year! GET HYPE!

Why can't i find fucking love?!,saberslash127,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9kci69/what_the_fuck_is_wrong_with_me_why_cant_i_find/,"I am so fucking lonely and feel like such a fucking loser. I am 21 fucking years old, turning 22 in a few months and I've YET to fucking find even a grain of love from someone I held feelings for. Like what the fuck is wrong with me? I feel so fucking lonely for the longest time, and at the time when I really needed someone else's affection to help me get through the toughest time in my life, I've only succeeded in having ANOTHER GIRL just reject my feelings towards her. This makes me feel like trash because this wasn't the first time it happened. Ever since Middle School, every girl that rejected me had always something about me that they didn't like and me being so insecure about myself thought that perhaps if I change myself into a better person, maybe I could get someone to finally accept my feelings back.

I changed so much for these girls. I changed how I looked, how I dressed, how I acted, became more fit, confident, humorous, good-looking, heck I fucking even got better grades in my school and continued my education in college just to show off I am not a loser....as if I am like competing for being an eligible bachelor in those cheesy sitcoms. Nobody would've recognized the disgusting, nervous wreck of a person I was before into the confident guy I am now.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a picture of me on the left with the stripe shirt:

[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806)

&amp;#x200B;

Yet even when I changed so much, even when I felt like I was at my prime and at the tender age of 21, I still FUCKING FAILED! This latest girl was soooo different from all the other girls I've met. I truly felt like she was going to be THE ONE, the girl that would be my very first love. But I was an idiot. I guess the last flaw I never was able to get fixed was figuring out if a girl liked me or not. I waited too long and didn't show my affection and now her feelings towards me had vanished. I realized my mistake the moment she said these words...""Just be yourself Ramon, you don't have to be anyone else to impress me""......No girl has ever said such a thing to me, and when I heard it from her, thats when I instantly fell in love wit her. I realized my mistake and tired desperately to rekindle that feeling but I couldn't get her to have the same spark she had before. She said in her own say that she has still embers of feeling towards me, but that she didn't believe it would last long if me and her got together. From what conversations we had for each other, it seemed to me she'd rather keep me as a friend then to lose me as a person.....

She was a truly amazing person, and despite myself, I was more than willing now more than ever to be anything she wanted me to be if she just gave me one last chance. But apparently this girl doesn't have feelings for people based on how they are as a person but more if she holds a certain spark for them. My spark for her is immense and white-hot but her for me is small embers.

I hope you guys understand my feelings right now as I typed this with tears rolling down my cheeks as I had to vent my feelings out SOMEWHERE. I've heard soon she will be leaving the workplace me and her both work at (which is the only place me and her really get to be together) and I feel like I will never find another girl like her in the world. She always says that even if we won't see each other for a while, she still thinks we are close friends but despite myself I can't see myself without her. She isn't allowed to go out and have social interactions because of her strict parents, so I keep on being afraid she would find someone else in her new job and she would forever be taken from me. She's going to be another reminder of my failure in finding love and I am once again alone. The reason why I desperately seek love is because I've never felt any true love in my own family and I can't get the same feeling from my friends. She was a truly loving person and her family was very loving as well, the kind of family I always wanted growing up and I was more than willing to be a part of. I was willing to have given her the world...

Now here I am....back at my Community College working to transfer to San Diego State University, working a second job as Programming Intern Job in a Medical/Health Tech Startup. Sometimes i contemplate if I should go work at the new place where she is planning to work next just so I can get some quality time with her again. Some people would say that I am successful and happy and getting somewhere in life. What they don't know is that deep inside, I am insecure, alone and depressed. People wouldn't realize the fact that everyday at home, I'd cry myself to sleep as I sit in my lonely bed one more night....all I ever wanted was for someone to be there when I get home, where i can place my head on her lap and cry my feelings out to her, telling me to keep on pushing forward and that she would always be there for me.....but I don't got that.....I'm just alone......sooo fucking alone..."

9kd1dp,0,2018-09-30,Advice on major for career,Madler84,gamedesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/9kd1dp/advice_on_major_for_career/,"Hello,

So to start off my end goal is to be either a game developer or designer.  My fall back plan is to be a web designer or developer.

Currently, my major is a bachelor of science in information systems and technology: design and development.  I have 50 credits completed.  

Starting out I thought this major covered all bases and would be a good degree that employers would like.  But looking ahead at the courses it largely focuses on systems and network, with a few development and programming courses. Which seems like I'll be taking a lot of courses that won't apply to my career and I question how ready I'll be for the workforce once I graduate.

Courses include:
object oriented design and software applications;
Language, logic and discrete math;
information and organizations;
usability engineering;
Organization and design of info systems;
Computer &amp; cyber forensics;
Distributed-object computing;
Intro to systems analysis and design;
Ist integration and problem solving;
Internship;
Foreign languages (3 courses);

This really comes across as an IT degree which is nice but lacks in the design aspect.

Im really considering switching to the digital design degree because the courses look a lot more useful and I can still minor in the previous degree.  But it provides so much flexibility that I can customize it to where I take just as many development courses as the previous and I really get great design knowledge as well. 

 The courses included with the digital design degree are:
Intro to computer graphics;
Gaming and interactive media (communication);
Application development design;
Intermediate &amp; object-oriented design;
Object-oriented design &amp; software applications;
Usability engineering;
Intro to visual studies;
Scripting fundamentals for visual arts;
3d design fundamentals;
Art of web design;
Animation fundamentals;
Computer 3-d modeling rendering &amp; animation;
Application design;
Digital multimedia design capstone;
Digital multimedia design studio;
Intro to digital art and design criticism;
Writing for the media;


 With all that said Im fearful of changing majors because from my research it seems that design degrees aren't that highly thought of.  I figure though with the customizability of this one I still get a great foundational development knowledge as well as great design knowledge.  I'm curious though will employers only look at degree title or will they actually consider the courses you took as well?  For those with experience in this industry would you recommend making the switch or sticking to what I've been doing?

Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for thoughtful recommendations."

I am a college senior looking for a chance to gain some insight towards a producer’s career path in television or film production following my graduation in Spring. I have considered the path of TV and film production due to my interest in developing content and eventually sharing creative control over a series. 
I have produced a few short student films and documentaries which have gone onto to festivals and also utilize my experience in editing internships to produce videos for local companies or social media spots for network clients. However, I am constantly looking to talk with anyone about their experience as a producer, unit production manager, co-producer, POC, APOC, or anything else for that matter! I know there are a lot of paths towards becoming a producer, even outside the production department, so I am willing to talk with anyone. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me fellow colleagues. Take care-

*What’s something you did as you entered the industry you’re glad you did sooner than later?*

*Do you have any pointers for a college student trying to follow that route? Specifically, anything you look that makes a candidate stand out. (i.e internships, past experience, their own work, etc).*


Thanks for taking the time to talk with me fellow colleagues. Take care-

That's about it for this week. I'll likely be making these posts on Sundays going forward. If u/ukfan515 feels like taking over again, I mean, they can... I don't really care...lol. 

Lately I've been getting more interested in studies and focus groups after I realized that an extremely large percentage of my beermoney earnings have actually come from them, and they have actually opened up a lot of opportunities for me. 

Also please don't be mad at me if this is a bad collection of studies this week. I feel like it's actually pretty small of a list in comparison to what ukfan515 would usually post, but I'm new here. Also please don't get mad if these studies aren't all entirely remote. Some of them are very unclear whether or not you'll ever have to do anything in person. Hopefully with time I will get better at compiling this list. 

I do want to ask though -- I noticed a lot of focus groups that were for specific cities only. Would it be appreciated if I compiled in-person focus groups for some of the larger cities in the US (a LOT of universities do these)? Additionally, would it be appreciate if I included 'chance to win' surveys? A fair number of people will post surveys where you'll have a chance at winning money or a gift card. Would it be beneficial to post these as well?

Looking for any and all feedback."
9ke1m2,5,2018-10-01,How to live with feeling guilty for something that is not your fault.,ThreeLeggedPugg,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9ke1m2/how_to_live_with_feeling_guilty_for_something/,"Sry for the long story:

So I struggled a lot to talk about this because I was unsure if this really counts as an abusive relationship. Especially thinking about if I provoked his behavior towards me and that I am the problem and the person who provokes such behavior.
He is on reddit but I doubt that he will be on this subreddit. ( I will still spare every detail about myself and himself)

So it started 2 years ago, he was my first real boyfriend. I had a good relationship to my family and friends that time. We met through friends and got along really fast. After a few dates we decided to have a relationship. We were in love but something was odd from the beginning. He had a rather cold relationship to his parents and was annoyed by mine. He didnt get along with his  brother to the extend that the didnt talk. He told me after some months that he had anger issues as a child and was in therapy at young age but stopped before school, he was bullied in middle school later but after a school change it got better. I was very supportive and actually didnt think much about that. After some time passed we started to fight. The pattern was always the same, I was upset about his often egozentric behavior towards me, he thought that I overreacted and got angry at me. Then I needed to apologize for me telling him that I didnt like something he did. He stopped talking to me for days when he was upset. Of course I always tried to talk to him and couldn't leave the situation as it was. He later used that to say that if I would leave him alone there would be no problem. Some time passed and I needed to leave the city for an internship. He wasnt supportive at that time and I felt extremely guilty for leaving. When I told him of my expiriences he always talked them down and showed me that he disliked my choices but because its my life I can do what I want. When I came back the criticism started, he more and more saw only my faults, he hated my clumsiness, my dreams and my way of living. He became jealous of my vacation and didnt want to talk to me about it after I came back. It came to arguements at the street where he walked away at night leaving me alone in pouring rain and a foreign country. He sometimes got anger outburst if I didnt leave him alone and hit himself.  I was so deepy confused by his actions and couldnt understand his behavior. Still I deeply loved him and tried to do everything I could to please him. I wanted to be with him and thought that if I try to explain him whats wrong he will change. I asked him to move together and he agreed. I thought that this showed that he wanted to be with me too. So we moved together after 1 year of relationship and this was the worst time of my life. From the moment on the criticism started to be more intense, he was always out, didnt invest in the relationship anymore and got annoyed by me more and more. I was so completely insecure by his behavior that I felt that I was only walking on eggshells. Then he broke up after 1 month living together. I was shocked. He changed his opinion after I convinced him that I would change. (Stupid me i know), we went to a vacation that I booked afterwards, he told me at the vacation that he loved me but at the last day he got an anger outburst in the supermarket and broke up before going into the bus ( 6 hours driving home). I packed my things and moved out immediately. He tried to make me feel guilty of leaving him alone in the flat. That we could still live together as flatmates to please our families. I noped out of that so fast. So of course I didnt want to move out but he wanted to break up and this was the consequence. Of course I tried to convince him to change his mind but it was a waste of time. He started to tell me he wanted to move together because it was convenient, he didnt see any future with me, I was the cause of his moods and anger outbursts because I was manipulative and provocative. On day when I was arguing with him about getting my stuff he throwed them out of the flat sending me a picture with the text: Im laughing at you. But the most aweful thing was him pushing me on the bed holding me and shouting at me that he will hit me so hard that I go to the hospital if I dont leave him alone. After that I stopped the contact with him for several months. He contacted me then and wanted to meet me. We met and he started to talk about that he was sorry but we both were at fault that time and he owes me a second try. I was still in love so I told him he needed to chance. He promised that he would seek therapy but never did. After some weeks he told me that he didnt have any feeling for me he just met me because of guilt and it is easier to solve this issue to stop the contact with me than do something like therapy because I triggered him. After that I was so angry and exhausted and only wanted everything to stop. I was so depressed, thinking to hurt myself, to make this pain go away (but i never did), I was afraid to get in a relationship again. Feelt guilt for my behavior and what happened. After some months I tried to date but every time I got near a guy I panicked and ran away (literally). I met then my now boyfriend who was so patient with me that I gave him a chance. Slowly I opened up but my flashbacks and my insecurity was still there. Even now after 1 year I still am triggered by small incidents. I learned to deal with this very slowly but it gets better every day. It needed a lot of courage to write this and it doesnt cover all of my expiriences. Of course there were also good moments with my ex but in comparison to my relationship now this was only me finding excuses for my exs behavior

So to the women and men who have similar expiriences I wish you the support of your family and friends. Trust your guts because I didnt and after some time I started to doubt myself for everything I thought. It still haunts me but I will fight against it and love myself."
9ke5fh,30,2018-10-01,How can I make it to New York?,opaquejelly,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/9ke5fh/how_can_i_make_it_to_new_york/,"Hello! This is a really long shot, but I'm bright-eyed and hopeful, so I'm doing all I can to make this work:

I'm a Singaporean female and 24 this year, and currently on my second last trimester of University. A bit about me: I finished my diploma in Mass Communication when I was 19, then took a few gap years to get some work experience (in Journalism, Marketing and Communications and now Digital Marketing) so that I can pay for my university school fees. I started a part-time degree in a private university last year, and now that I'm almost done, I want to pursue my dream of working in New York. I've interned and worked in a magazine company before, and then a non-profit semi-government company, and am currently in a digital/PR agency.

Here are the difficulties that people have been telling me so far: first, I didn't take an internship in New York, so it's harder to get there. Secondly, I can't just apply for a job in New York as a foreigner because companies will not just go through the hassle of a visa sponsorship for someone they hardly know. Thirdly, apparently it's harder to get into NYC now because of the current presidential situation(??) Fourthly, my skill set/job experience is apparently too common, but what I do has always been my passion and I'd like to stick with it if possible.

And here are the advice I've gotten so far (thank you kind strangers here who have given me advice as well): Find a MNC to work at in my country and apply for a transfer, or makes lots of connections with people who are in New York now. Unfortunately, the MNCs here are usually banks which don't transfer people of my field over, and I don't really know anyone in New York as well. I've been trying to get to know people on Reddit and other platforms though, which is pretty interesting so far!

Which brings me to my point now, does anyone in NYC have any other advice? I'm still working hard and taking the other advice that people have given me here, but I'd still love to hear more views and also connect with the locals in NYC. :) How do I make connections with other media people in NYC? Could I apply for an internship somehow through any internship websites here? This will be very expensive and tedious, and I already have job experience but I'm willing to try it because of my dream. Are there any people here I could get perhaps get to know and learn more about the job industry in NYC? Or is there anyone who is hiring and don't mind taking a chance on me (long, LONG shot, but it's worth a try!)

On top of all of that, I'm also planning to make a trip to NYC early next year once I'm done with school (April or May). Will I have a chance of making connections there? What could I do to make the trip worth it? Is there anyone on Reddit who wouldn't mind meeting to get to know me, and be able to give advice and introduce me to the right people? I could buy you a coffee, or bake you a sweet bag of cookies (I love baking!)

Boy, this is a long post, but I've been dreaming of this for a long time now and finally have the opportunity to reach out and try to make my dream come true. Thank you everyone in advance for your advice, and I'd love to get to make some new friends in New York as well! :)"
9kffhf,34,2018-10-01,Does anyone else have deeper rooted issues that led them to being NEET?,Deathsoundssweet,NEET,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/comments/9kffhf/does_anyone_else_have_deeper_rooted_issues_that/,"In the last two years back when I went to school, which was over 7 years ago, I had mad social anxiety. I decided that I wanted to treat it and ""get over it"". Ironically, I didn't even know for a long time how this ""thing"" was called or that it's even a specific diagnosis. My thought process back then was, if I didn't get this ""thing"" cured, my academic or any other career path, aswell as my quality of life, would suffer massively, as it was evidenced during my last school years. My intentions were good, but the implentation was rather difficult.

Not only did I have SA, but I had no drive to go forward. I just didn't have this one passion that pulled me towards it, I didn't have this one skill set which could be used for certain jobs. Two years after I graduated from school I was put in a retail salesman training for a month. The time for me there was hard. Not because it was intellectually challenging, but the way it triggered my SA. The first day we should stand up, go infront of the class, which really consisted of only 7 people or so and introduce ourselves. The worst part was when one day, we had to go infront of the class and try to sell this item (not sure what it was). Hands were shaking, voice was trembling and I had no idea what to say. You could just feel how uncomfortable the atomosphere suddenly got. After it was finally over, I sat down and I still remember the snarky comment that the instructor gave me: ""Damn buddy, your pump was working overtime there eh?"". After the salesman training we had to do a 4 week internship. I did mine at a retailshop for clothes, which was a different ""challenge"". I write ""challenge"" because you usually feel a sense of accomplishment when you pass it, but this felt more like senseless suffering. Well, atleast I know that retail jobs are not for me. To make it short: The ""boss"" was a 24 years old absolute, unsympathetic bitch. One male co-worker my age was some passive agressive cunt who mentioned ""So you are going back to recieving state benefits...?"".

One event after that, which I won't explain any further, lead to me finally meeting a therapist. Well kind of. My mother found him and gave me his number. We had sessions for over a year until I shared my doubts with him about the effectiveness of those ""therapy"" sessions. He mostly agreed with me and said his capabilities are limited. He advised me to seek out a psychiatric day care clinic and maybe stay there for a little while. After a long inner conflict if I should do this or not, I finally gave in and arranged an appointment. I arrived there during a weekend and got introduced to some people. To make this short aswell, I didn't last long there. My brain which is used constant escapism, just couldn't handle the montone routine there and being alone with my thoughts. The people there, about 20 or so in total, were around my age, but I had nothing in common with them. I don't want to play the gatekeeper but it seemed to me that some mental illnesses were quite liberally diagnosed, if even that. My impression, after learning why they were there, was that most of the people weren't as deep in the mud as me. I felt oddly out of place, where everyone is supposed to have some mental problems. I called my dad to pick me up, when he arrived he made some stupid joke and I was not in the mood for it. It was a quite ride home and a grim and dark day for me, litteraly and figuratively. I put ""all my money"" on this thing that was supposed to be the turning point in my life...but it was not.

Fastforward to 2018, the 1st October. Though I have done two internships this years, I'm still NEET. I had therapy sessions for a year with a different therapist, but she dropped my like a sack of potatos after a verbal fight a few months ago. I turn 25 next year and a few years ago I set a deadline for myself. ""If I turn 25 and I'm still NEET, it's the best to end things."" Not sure if I still think that way, but it pains to me hear that I turn 25 next year. I would even go as to say it paralyzes me that I haven't achieved anything since I'm out of school. It feels like a bad dream, but it's not and I remeber every little detail of that bad ongoing dream

Needless to say that all those things ate away on my self confidence, energy and hope. What will and can I do for the next few decades seems like a bigger than life question to me at this point. All I know that it's not going to get any easier, in fact only harder. All those years in mostly isolation, sitting at home, consuming fucked up material, escapism, those ups and downs all the while SA and depressive phases corroded my mental health over the years...all those thoughts that I cultivated during those years in my brain on how the world works, I'm not sure if I can entirely erase them because they seem to be incompatible if you want to live a happy life.

What about you guys, do you guys have something aswell that just won't let you out of the mud?

I've got my CCNA and CCNP at age 16 and 19, respectively. In between, I worked as an intern and then as a NOC engineer at local ISP. During that time I was studying at school and then I become student at local university.

At first, I was really motivated to have CCIE knowledge, but my expectations slowly faded away due to inappropriate salary and low number of vacancies for Network engineers (Compared to developers) at my area (Caucasus) or at job searching platforms worldwide.

Because of my naive childish mind, I thought that after spending so much time apart from family, friends and social activities, even if I had CCNP, I would have at least $80k yearly salary and it would be easier for me to relocate either to EU or NA, but it didn't happen after many unsuccessful attempts.

At that time, I had significant amount of  knowledge in Linux system administration, Network engineering and basic scripting, So I unconsciously started to shift to the DevOps role.

I started new job as a QA/DevOps engineer at US startup that had an office in my country. With my team, I successfully completed several projects and moved to the new job at local Bank as a Automation/DevOps Engineer, where I am currently at age 21.

Now, I don't dream about CCIE anymore, I agree that it is valuable knowledge to have, but I think it is better to focus my energy and time to somewhere else. As a DevOps engineer I've got much more perks and prospects ahead of me (I am getting offers from different countries without sending resumes, much more salary, feel more valuable, etc..).

I am glad that I didn't stick to the certification career path due to my characteristic about finishing things to the end, even if it does have negative effects on me or does not have effect at all. I will see how it goes from now."

PART 1 - WCW NITRO 09/11/1995

This week, we get our first head to head showdown between Raw and Nitro, so I get double the shows to cover! I'll be presenting Nitro before Raw, both because Raw tended to get pre-empted more often than Nitro, and because honestly, WCW was the reason I wanted to do retro reviews anyway so \*\*\*\* it.

\-Hey, something noteworthy happens during the commentator's introduction! We learn that Vader (who is supposed to be on Hogan's War Games team at Fall Brawl)  has apparently “gone AWOL” and has “not filed the proper documents” and thus will not be on the show. It should be noted that “gone AWOL” is code for “left the promotion”, and “not filed the proper documents” is code for “went back to Japan for a few months, then showed up in the WWF in January”. OOPS! This is the go home show for Fall Brawl, so yeah... Kind of a last minute announcement there guys!

1. SABU VS ALEX WRIGHT Hoo boy! I don't think any of us were ready for the unpredictable, sloppy but super fun high flying spot monkey that was Sabu. Not anyone watching at home who hadn't heard of ECW yet, not Alex Wright, and certainly not traditional fans of Southern rasslin in general. Don't think that I'm disparaging him with the sloppy comment either, because it's almost an integral part of his style. Dude botches about as many spots as Sin Cara on any given night, but they almost never feel like botches. It feels more like an insane guy trying insane sh\*t that no one should be able to successfully pull off in the first place, so it works for him. He also brings this insane recklessness that mainstream wrestling fans just hadn't seen up to this point. I'll put it to you this way: the first minute of the match has him doing a triangle jump wheel kick, and then a rana to the floor. These are his FIRST TWO MOVES! By minute two, he's brought a chair out, and is doing a chair jump wheel kick into the \*\*\*\*ing BARRICADE because Wright moved! Wright gets some offense in here but yeah, this is mostly a squash to get over Sabu's unique form of “I'm going to kill myself to beat you”, and is pretty dope for a short showcase match if I'm being honest. Sabu picks up the win with an avalanche Victory Roll, but continues to attack after the bell rings, and although he's not D'Von Dudley, he gets the table, putting Wright through it with a big dive. This causes the ref to reverse the decision, so there you go. Sabu loses a squash match that he won. RESULTS: Alex Wright def. Sabu via DQ

\-In what tends to be a highlight in any show, Ric Flair is out to talk to Mene Gene Okerlund! He throws total shade at “Dabbalay” (that's how he pronounces “Double A” when he's screaming) for choosing to spend his weekend... GASP! On the phone with his wife and kid instead of out partying with Flair! The DASTARD! Luger shows up during the interview, and Flair puts him over big time, and cracks me up by just calling him “Package”. “Tonight, the Package will be in control!” sounds needlessly sexual, and I love it!

2) US TITLE MATCH: V.K. WALLSTREET VS STING (C.) If you're wondering who “V.K. Wallstreet” is, it's Michael Wallstreet with a new name, one week after he was introduced as “Michael Wallstreet”. If you're wondering “what's up with the V.K.”, as Bischoff did, well, this was a classic example of pro wrestling promotions \*\*\*\*ing with each other passive aggressively. VK is just like the initials of Vincent Kennedy McMahon, GET IT?!?!?!?!?! Speaking of passive aggressive \*\*\*\*ing with, Bischoff starts another Nitro tradition here: spoiling the results of pre-recorded Raw episodes. A move that never ever backfires on the promotion. You'll notice I'm not talking about the match, and that's because there's not much to be said here. It was a well worked squash, and while Wallstreet did get to shine on offense a bit, it might as well have been Sting vs Barry Horowitz, the conclusion was so foregone. Sting hits a Stinger Splash and a big crossbody from the top for the victory, because Vincent Kennedy Wallstreet wasn't even worth using a finisher on.

3) SCOTT “FLASH” NORTON VS MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE Oh man, we'll get there in a bit, but I can tell you right now, this match has one of my favorite “LOL WHAT?!?!?!?!” finishes ever. It is super stupid, and yet logical at the same time, and I don't even know how that combination is possible! You gotta give Savage a ton of credit here, he was beyond willing to bump his ass off and make this new monster look good in his debut match. Could you imagine Hogan doing that? Norton looks like a powerful beast who is nigh impossible to stop, Savage looks like a combination of wiley veteran and massive underdog, it's the perfect story to tell and executed splendidly here up until the finish. Within seconds of Savage avoiding a big crossbody attempt and mounting a comeback, the DUNGEON OF DOOM (specifically Kamala and Shark) come out to run interference. As both of them are getting up on the apron, Savage chucks Norton into them. Norton collapses, Kamala falls out of the ring, and Shark falls THROUGH the ropes, landing on Norton's legs and trapping him on the mat! Savage goes up top and takes advantage by hitting the Big Elbow, and essentially Norton lost a match because an interloper was TOO FAT for him to escape! Very LOL WHAT, but also very believable if I'm being honest. The rest of the Dungeon hit the ring but Savage bails before they can get to him. Good stuff here. RESULTS: Macho Man def. Scott Norton via pinfall

4) MAIN EVENT - WCW WORLD TITLE MATCH: LEX LUGER VS HULK HOGAN (W/JIMMY HART)(C.) Man, 4 matches in one hour? We're lucky to get more than 4 matches on a 2 hour episode of Smackdown these days. And they still found time to build some last minute angles for the PPV while they were at it. So here's a sentence you won't hear me say very often: Lex Luger is clearly the best worker in this match, how often does THAT happen? (Spoiler alert: there's actually a brief run in 1996 where Luger decides to become a super secret super worker, and I can't WAIT to get there!) But yeah, tell me how frustrating this is... Luger is making his return to the promotion as a hot acquisition, he's immediately positioned as a big deal, a “chaotic neutral Hulk Hogan” as Uproxx writer Brandon Stroud once put it, so what does Hogan do? He eats him up in the usual Hogan “I'm going to take your best offense and then \*\*\*\*ing no sell it and make you look like a chump” formula, how \*\*\*\*ing frustrating is THAT?!?!?! Luger gets to look more like he's capable of dealing damage to Hogan than the average opponent, but it all gets negated anyway so what does it even ----ing matter?!?!?! As a fun aside, Bischoff buries the WWF here again, saying that their current champion used to work for WCW and couldn't even get past their midcard. That champion was Diesel, who, spoiler alert, would return to WCW next year and kind of sort of help make them the biggest name in pro wrestling for awhile. OOPS! Oh, and if you think I was being harsh in my assessment of Hogan making Luger's best offense look meaningless, try this on for size: he gets locked in the TORTURE RACK for a good minute or so, they do the “raise your hand 3 times” thing that is usually just reserved for sleepers, Luger thinks Hogan's hand went down for the third time and dropped him, thinking he won, and then Hogan NO SOLD THE F—-ING TORTURE RACK! Seriously, for all of the grief modern fans give to guys like Cena, holy sh-t, Hogan makes Cena look like Dolph Ziggler in terms of making his opponent looks good! You know how the rest of this goes: sh-tty punches that look like they don't hurt, sh-tty Big Boot that is less “I'm kicking you in the face” and more “I'm holding my foot up and you're running into it”, and sh-tty Leg Drop that looks like it could hurt but he never gets much height on it, but before he can pick up the win, OOPS! The Dungeon Of Doom have left their mystical ice cave with water that's not hot (seriously, this was established in a promo video once)  for the second time tonight to do the run in, causing a DQ. Interesting to note, as it plants the seeds for a storyline down the line, they don't even touch Luger, and swarm Hogan en masse. It makes sense, as Hogan is Sullivan's mortal enemy here, and Luger is just some guy who came back, but like I said, this becomes key later on. Sting and Savage run in to make the save, and I'm just surprised that Hogan didn't no sell a 5-on-1 assault and beat them all up himself. RESULT: Hulk Hogan def. Lex Luger via DQ

\-For the second week in a row, we end the show with the same four babyfaces in the ring trying to air their grievances. Hogan and Savage both interpret “the Dungeon didn't touch a guy we don't have beef with” as “YOU MUST BE ON THEIR SIDE YOU STUPID \*\*\*\*ER!”, whereas Sting (who is notorious for being stupid and naive) comes up with “LUGER SHOULD BE ON OUR WARGAMES TEAM!!!!!” Sting thinks he should, Macho thinks he shouldn't, and Hogan asks “Wait... so you're suggesting we put Luger on our team?”, because he can't even be bothered to pay attention to his own \*\*\*\*ing angle. Hogan decides that yes, he accepts Luger onto the team, despite the fact that he could probably win War Games on his own anyway. Luger accepts the offer, on the condition that he gets another title shot, and this is how we go off the air: the babyfaces are either terrible human beings, or stupid. So just like the modern WWE.

&amp;#x200B;

PART 2 – WWE MONDAY NIGHT RAW 09/11/1995

\-A couple of show notes before I dive into the review. (1) Damnit, just two weeks before this was Summerslam 95, with the HBK/Razor ladder match. Why couldn't Nitro have started two weeks sooner, and allowed me to review that?!?!?! (2) For those of you who are expecting the classic Raw announce team of Jerry Lawler and Jim Ross, what we get is... not quite that. Lawler is here, but this is before he became a rambling, baby canine obsessed pervert, and was basically just a mean spirited Southern rasslin heel in color commentary form. It \*\*\*\*ing rules. Opposite of him is Vince McMahon, and if you've ever been privy to listening to McMahon on commentary, you know you're in for an hilarious treat. Lots of borderline incoherent screaming that just sounds like “BAH BAH BAH BAH BAH” and occasionally forms words, lots of “WHATAMANEUVER!”, and tons of thinking that every single pin that happens in a match is a 3 count and the match is over. With a healthy dose of “right in the (body part) area!”

1. RAZOR RAMON VS THE BRITISH BULLDOG (W/JIM CORNETTE) Before the match kicks off, we get Summerslam footage of Dean Douglas giving the HBK/Razor ladder match a poor grade. Dean is, of course, ECW icon Shane Douglas (a very Dynamic Dude I hear, ahem...) working a Wrestling Teacher gimmick, because WWF's mission statement of “The New Generation” really translates to “Let's hire a bunch of talented wrestlers and saddle them with cartoony characters and/or occupational gimmicks.” Wrestling Scarface doesn't take kindly to Wrestling Teacher's poor grade and assaults him; he's the babyface here. Oh, and another part of the “New Generation” mission statement was “Let's take these talented wrestlers we hired and have them wrestle the most boring matches possible.” Seriously, this isn't a bad match or anything, but there are lots of restholds, lots of old fashioned punchy kicky offense, Bulldog spends time powdering to the floor to confer with Cornette, it would probably be great if this were the opening build to a 10-15 minute long match. Instead, we get maybe 6 minutes of match, a ref bump (which ensured that the ref didn't see Razor get the visual pin after a Razor's Edge), and run ins from both Douglas and the 1-2-3 Kid. The ref misses the Douglas run in, but is awake when Kid tries to stop a Bulldog pinfall with a splash. Bulldog moves, Razor gets splashed, and the match is over. OOPS! Post-match, Bulldog and Cornette put the boots to our babyfaces, and we don't even find out who wins until the post-match interview. RESULTS: The British Bulldog def. Razor Ramon via DQ.

\-Vince conducts a post-match interview with both Razor and Kid after the match, with King throwing shade at virtually every sentence he makes. It's awesome, but also super distracting. Kid asserts that he didn't cost Razor the match tonight, but points out that apparently Razor cost him a match last week, and then challenges The Bad Guy (who is a good guy now) to a match next week, reminding him about those two times he beat Razor back in 1993. Or was it 94? I don't even remember. Razor informs “McMang” (the racism is in his words, not mine!) that hey, even though he's feuding with Bulldog and Douglas, sure, he accepts. Next week, it'll be Wrestling Scarface vs future real life one-time porn star!

2) RAD RADFORD AND THE BROOKLYN BRAWLER VS THE SMOKING GUNS Or Wrestling Cowboys vs Wrestling Hobo Street Fighter and... Well, I don't even know what Radford's gimmick is, but Rad is actually Louis Spicolli, sadly one of the many, many wrestling tragedies. Man, I forgot that both Gunns were apparently going for “Cowboy Magnum T.A.” here, sporting the one-two combo great mullet and 'stache. But yeah, this was nothing more than a very short squash match, with a brief babyface shine spot, Bart Gunn playing Face In Peril for a cup of coffee, a hot tag to Billy,  and a combination Side Slam (Bart)/Flying Leg Drop (Billy) for the win. RESULTS: The Smoking Gunns def. Brooklyn Brawler and Rad Radford via pinfall

\-Here's a treat, we get a great promo from Goldust in his original incarnation, before he had Marlena along as his director, when he spoke in really cryptic sentences, and quoted movies. I can't be sure, but I think his New Generation gimmick was basically Wrestling Oscar Award. Later to become Wrestling Gay Panic Oscar Award.

3) ISAAC YANKEM D.D.S. VS SCOTT TAYLOR Or Wrestling Dentist vs jobber! Yankem is, of course, the first WWF incarnation of Glenn Jacobs, who would go on to be Fake Diesel, and of course Kane. Lest you think that this was his first stupid gimmick, in Smokey Mountain, he had a Unabomber gimmick, and in Memphis, he was both a Christmas tree themed monster, AND Doomsday from the Superman comics, proving that wrestling has always been extremely stupid at heart. Scott Taylor is, of course, the future Scotty 2 Hotty of 2 Cool. This brief paragraph took longer to write than it did for this jobber squash to finish up, Yankem gets in slow power offense, Taylor gets in pretty much zero offense, and Yankem scores the win by hitting the DDS, which is a combination of “DDT”, and “dentist joke, GET IT?!?!?!” RESULTS: Isaac Yankem def. Scott Taylor via pinfall

\-Oh \*\*\*\*, I forgot that Todd Petengill was a thing, he's on hand to give the In Your House report and runs down the card. Man, Todd is kind of a sub-Michael Cole lame nerd, but I REALLY miss the days when we'd get angle recaps in the form of sports reports like this, instead of 20 minute long promos with multiple “Earlier Tonight” videos every week.

4) MAIN EVENT – INTERCONTINENTAL TITLE MATCH: SYCHO SID (W/TED DIBIASE) VS SHAWN MICHAELS (C.) No, that's not a typo, this is how the WWF chose to spell Psycho. It makes sense I guess, Sid probably isn't so great at spelling. He's twice the man you are, and has half the brain that you do after all (I can't WAIT to cover that promo!) HBK cuts a brief backstage promo on Sid while he makes his way to the ring, and marks me out by being leary of a ladder as he passes by. Both because he had a brutal ladder match 2 weeks prior AND because it's hilarious! Funny enough, in about a year or so, these two would have a much higher profile match, for a more high profile title, and with way more overbooked nonsense. This feels like the only match of the night that breaks the New Generation slow match trope, as Michaels is still the exciting dynamo in 1995 that you would expect him to be. Sure, Sid powders to the floor a few times to stall, and the “heat on the babyface” portions of the match are slow paced but that's fine, it's what a heel is supposed to do, it's only when the babyface shine portions of the match aren't exciting, or zero drama is built that this formula becomes a problem. Bonus points to Dibiase for getting in some stomps to Michaels' back while he's laying out on the floor, that's the kind of old school manager sh\*t that wrestling is so sorely missing now. If you watched Nitro, then you already got a rough idea of how this one ended (thank you Eric Bischoff), but I liked the finish here because it kept Sid strong. Eric made it sound like Michaels got the win with one Superkick, but in order to make Sid seem that much more like a monster, it actually took 3 of them. The first two merely stunned him, and the third one put him away. For a free tv match in 1995, this was really good, and even with my jaded 2018 sensibilities, I enjoyed it a lot in general. Michaels does bad white boy stripper dances to celebrate, and it's definitely no wonder why in '96 he was getting “Shawn is gay” chants. RESULTS: Shawn Michaels def. Sycho Sid via pinfall

\--We close the show with Dok Hendrix getting a backstage interview with both HBK and Diesel (\*\*\*\* the Kliq was all over this episode), and they put over the Triple Header match happening at the upcoming In Your House PPV. If you don't know what a Dok Hendrix is, it's former Fabulous Freebirds member/current HoFer and writer Michael “P.S.” Hayes, and no, I don't know why you'd hire a legendary rock 'n roll gimmick talker like Hayes and turn him into a proto Michael Cole type. The Triple Header match, by the way, is a normal tag match with kinda cluster\*\*\*\* rules, where HBK's IC title, Diesel's World title, AND Owen Hart/Yokozuna's tag titles are all on the line. Nope, there's no way that Team Kliq are winning thing one and holding all of the titles in the company, ahem... (Spoiler alert: I actually don't remember the outcome of this one, and haven't spoiled it for myself, so I'll find out when I review it!)

THE TV RATINGS: WWF Monday Night Raw def. WCW Monday Nitro 2.5 to 2.4 All things considered, a 0.1 point loss at this point is pretty damn good for WCW. Nitro was still very much a new show going up against a more established series with a lot more buzz around it, plus Raw giving away a PPV caliber match like HBK/Sid (something that didn't happen often in this era) was sure to attract viewers. And honestly, we're not even at a point yet where either show was generating new fans, or stealing that many viewers in the first place; each promotion more or less had their own built in fanbase who either liked both shows, or didn't give a \*\*\*\* about the other show. Overall, I do think that Nitro was the better show this week. As frustrating as the usual Hulk Hogan bullsh\*t was and always will be, WCW creative tried way harder than the WWF's formula of “We're giving them a great main event, let's do 2 short squashes and a short marquee match with a \*\*\*\* finish!” Although spoiler alert, that \*\*\*\* finish leads to a pretty fun angle, so I can't even hate on it at all.

HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK: HBK vs Sycho Sid. As much as anyone who knows my tastes might expect me to give this to Sabu vs Wright (given my love of Cruiserweight action, and being such a WCW fanboy at heart), that match was a fun car wreck. Raw's main event, on the other hand, actually took time to tell an in ring story, and still featured exciting action. I didn't mention it in the match, but damn, for a guy who has the reputation of being a terrible worker, Sid was ON POINT in the match. I don't think I'd ever seen him do an HBK style kip up, but he even broke one of those out, outstanding big man stuff from the dude.

LOWLIGHT OF THE WEEK: I'll give you three guesses. Your first two are wrong. As “meh” as watching the Raw squash matches were, at least they served to get over the right talent without doing so at the expense of an actual star. Hogan vs Luger, sadly, basically nerfed the sh\*t out of Luger, who as I mentioned earlier, was touted as being such a hot acquisition and a big deal, but had to fall victim to the ego of a balding orange skinned backstage politician with a creative control clause in his contract. The sad thing is, I might have given something else the lowlight nod if the finish would have come BEFORE Hogan made Luger's Torture Rack look inefficient, and if the Dungeon Of Doom hit the ring and caused the DQ BEFORE “Well, time for me to no sell and hit my finishing sequence” but alas, that's not how Hogan rolls.

NEXT WEEK: The Dungeon of Doom vs the Brothers and Dudes in WAR GAMES! It's WCW Fall Brawl, can Hulk Hogan and his ancillary character friends defeat a bunch of clowns in bad Halloween costumes, and allow Hogan the right to take on the Satanic Bostonian equivalent to Danny Devito in the ring for 5 minutes? Check back here next time to find out!

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

&amp;#x200B;

\-As a brief note before the show kicks off, due to Nitro only coming into existence two weeks prior to the PPV, and me not having episodes of Worldwide or Saturday Night to catch up on any angles, we're basically going into this PPV blind. There's bound to be a few things happening that I have no explanation or backstory for, and I can't rely on nostalgia or memory because I wasn't actually watching WCW at this point in my life when this originally aired; I kind of tuned out of the product when Hogan showed up and nerfed all of my favorites, and only got back into it after Hall showed up in May of '96.  So yeah, here's hoping that online reviews I've read before and Wikipedia help me fill in the blanks!

1. US TITLE #1 CONTENDER MATCH: JOHNNY B. BADD VS FLYIN' BRIAN PILLMAN Something else I maybe should have included in the show notes: one of the fun things about Fall Brawl (or any PPV including a War Games match) is the visual of seeing two rings side by side all night. Some of the more clever workers (Rey Mysterio, I'm looking at you when you eventually show up) would actually use this as more than just a cool visual, and build spots around it. Additional note: I REALLY wish I knew what was happening on the B shows during this era, because white meat babyface ass Pillman was getting absolutely BOO'D during the introductions. Did he start randomly doing heel things on Saturday Night and I'm not aware of it? Or does this city just really love Boxing Little Richard: The Wrestler? So do you guys remember how episode 1 of Nitro started with a hot Pillman vs Liger match that I said would largely set the pace for how WCW shows typically worked? This is a much higher stakes version of that, where a shot at Sting's US title (which has NEVER been mentioned on Nitro thus far) is on the line, with two high fliers who pale in comparison to what the company would see over the next few years but were still fantastic for this era, and gets just a little shy of 30 minutes of time! Cruiserweight matches on modern day Raw were lucky to get more than 3 minutes when they were happening regularly, so a 30 minute PPV opener between two guys who could go is an absolute treat. Of course, this is pre-luchadore high flier action, so it's REALLY a combination of athletic moves, mat wrestling, and strikes. Kind of the prototype version of modern heavyweight matches with indie guys who can do flippy sh\*t as well as work a more traditional size. Only with more ring psychology. As the match rolls on, I'm honestly wondering if Pillman DID go rudo at some point between Nitro 1 and now because this goes very quickly from “friendly babyface vs babyface wrestling match” to “OH GOD! Brian, why are you punching Badd in the face so hard that his ----ing eye is bleeding?!?!?!” It's a good choice for storytelling purposes, as it helps add a heightened sense of urgency to the match, and it gives former heel, former boxer Badd an excuse to get heated and throw fists of his own without looking like he's reverting back to his bad guy roots. Bonus points to Pillman trying to go all Code of Honor after things get heated by extending a hand, DOUBLE bonus points to Badd for being like “---- that, you PUNCHED ME IN THE ----ING FACE!” and refusing the handshake. Oh, and remember how I said this match got just shy of 30 minutes? The fun part is that the match actually had a 20 minute time limit! Womp womp! So yeah, the 20 minute time limit expires, and referee Nick Patrick decides that there has to be a #1 contender crowned, so the match will continue under sudden death overtime rules. So in other words, a regular match, and the whole notion of giving the match a 20 minute time limit was a moot point to begin with if there had to be a winner anyway. It's a minor oops, but still, OOPS! Pillman actually got the visual pin going into the time limit expiring, getting a 2 count on a backslide with the bell ringing right before 3, so you can probably guess who's ACTUALLY winning the match based on that, right? This final stretch has spots that would absolutely pop crowds TODAY, I should add, like Badd hitting an Avalanche Rana, or getting on the apron and press slamming Pillman off of the top turnbuckle, to the FLOOR and INTO THE ----ING BARRICADE! HOLY SH*-*T! This is so good that Heenan accidentally invents a modern wrestling fan chant, claiming “THIS IS WRESTLING!” The finish is comparatively simple, but great. Badd whips Pillman, and whiffs a clothesline. Pillman tries a clothesline on the rebound, he also whiffs. On the NEXT rebound, both men barrel forward at full speed, attempt simultaneous crossbodies and collide mid-air. Badd happens to land on Pillman and picks up the win, telling the story of “I may have beat Brian Pillman tonight, but just barely!” Seriously guys, even if you aren't the types to hit the Network and watch any of these shows as I review them, if you have a good 30 minutes to kill some night, hop onto the Network and watch this match. It was an absolute classic in '95, and still holds up today in 2018. RESULTS: Johnny B. Badd def. Flyin' Brian Pillman in Sudden Death Overtime via pinfall MELTZER RATING: \*\*\*\* (Match of the night)

\-Mene Gene brings us our first interview of the night, with “The Nature Boy” Ric Flair, which is always awesome even when Flair doesn't have anything more significant to say than to recap his feud with Arn Anderson. The battle of brothers who have different career goals and are clashing as a result.

2) COBRA VS SGT. CRAIG PITTMAN Oh \*\*\*\*, how do I even explain this without sounding like I'm making things up? Pittman is a former marine turned pro wrestler who, while never the best worker in the world, had a legit amateur background and had a few super dope matches towards the end of his WCW career, as you'll see over the coming months. (Spoiler alert: this is not one of them!) Cobra is probably better known for his time later on in company history as the nWo's Fake Sting, here he's playing another military guy in what I can basically only describe as a Wrestling GI Joe feud. The story is that Cobra was a subordinate to Pittman during the Gulf War, but also CIA and/or Special Forces, according to the commentary team? He was left behind by his commanding officer during a mission, and has come back seeking revenge. WRESTLING REVENGE! Note that this is the blow off to their feud, and it's so important that the match gets less than 10% of the time that our opener did. Cobra (who's music is seriously just \*\*\*\*ing Morse code, because wow) makes his way out, Pittman's music hits but he doesn't make his way out, instead some ADDITIONAL GI Joe themed guy comes out to stand on the apron. Cobra yells at this solider, Pittman rappels down from the rafters, sneaks up on Cobra, CHOKES HIM THE \*\*\*\* OUT with his bullet belt before the bell rings, and after like a minute or so of bad striking and attempted wrestling moves that never make it past the “attempted” phase, Pittman locks in his Code Red cross armbar finish for the win. Remember, THIS WAS THE BLOW OFF MATCH TO A FEUD! I spent like 5 times the length of this match just writing about the backstory! RESULTS: Sgt. Craig Pittman def. Cobra via submission MELTZER RATING: DUD (and no, this is NOT your worst match of the night)

\-OH SH\*T! I DID NOT KNOW THIS AIRED ON FALL BRAWL! So Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorf (who in 1995 was still \*\*\*\*ing AWESOME, though sadly towards the end of his career) was going through a bit of a career crisis. He lost faith in himself, and began questioning whether or not he even WAS Mr Wonderful anymore. This triggers a run in cameo appearance from Gary Spivey? Gary Spivey of the Psychic Companions Network? (To use Orndorf's on words), who uses his Psychic Companions Network powers to basically just tell Orndorf to look in the mirror and say how awesome he is. I can't even do this justice, it's so ridiculous, so watch it below. The payoff to this is... Well, it's nothing, so just enjoy the \*\*\*\*ing video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKC8d\_KWk6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKC8d_KWk6s)

3) TV TITLE MATCH: DIAMOND DALLAS PAGE (W/THE DIAMOND DOLL AND MAX MUSCLE) VS THE RENEGADE (W/JIMMY HART) (C.) Speaking of “it's nothing”... THIS MATCH! If you remember my Uncensored '95 review, Renegade was basically a faux-Ultimate Warrior with none of Warrior's upside. While history remembers DDP as becoming a great (if not overly rehearsed) worker with an insane ability to connect with the audience, this is absolutely not the case in 1995, here the closest thing he has to a visual upside is “has a hot wife who serves as his hot valet”. Things would get better for one of these two men at least, but that doesn't help this match at all, sadly. You may also notice that I've yet to mention the TV title in my Nitro reviews, and that's because it is seriously one of 3 different titles on the card that were never brought up or seen on the flagship show; neither Sting's US title (despite him featuring prominently on both episodes), Renegade's TV title nor the Tag titles were even brought up once. I'm guessing that these feuds were built up on Worldwide and Saturday Night, and were never featured on the new flagship show because hey, it debuted 2 weeks before the PPV, might as well focus solely on Hogan's World title? I originally went into this match thinking that nicest thing I'll say about it is that it was at least short, at a little over 8 minutes long. Probably 8 minutes longer than it needed to be. Then as I watched it, I found small things that I actually wound up enjoying way more than I had any business doing.  Page wasn't exactly a great worker at this stage in career, but he did an exceptional job both playing the chickensh\*t heel role here, as well as bumping his ass off to carry Renegade to something watchable. He also has what I jokingly call the prototype version of Tye Dillinger's gimmick going on here, where he'll perform a spot and then make Diamond Doll (his wife Kimberley) hold up a sign rating that spot as a perfect 10. Okay, I take back some of the criticism I made earlier, Paige was already absolutely on point as a character worker at this point. And despite my comments about Renegade having pretty much no upside, I have to give him a bit of credit, I think he could have been a solid midcard hand if he ever learned to put a little oomph behind his offense and make it look like it was hurting anyone. Dude had the right level of energy, but with zero intensity behind his moves, and it just looked slightly above Hogan levels of phony. The finish was kinda cool too, even if it made Renegade briefly look clever, and then like a complete idiot. Max Muscle (a former bodybuilder who never really did much beyond this WCW run) got up on the apron, but Renegade sent Page into him, and hit a surprisingly nice powerslam. He went up top for a big splash or something, but instead opted to dive from the top turnbuckle to the FLOOR and hit Max with a Diving Clothesline, in what is easily the best spot of the match. He tries to get back into the ring, but Max holds his leg, and this allows DDP to hit his Diamond Cutter and become your NEW WCW TV champion. Honestly, while this wasn't a great match by any means, it was still better than I anticipated going in. RESULTS: DDP def. Renegade via pinfall MELTZER RATING: \*\*

4) WCW TAG TITLE MATCH: HARLEM HEAT (W/SISTER SHERRI) VS DIRTY DICK SLATER AND BUNKHOUSE BUCK (W/ COL. ROBERT PARKER) (C.) I probably don't need to say anything about Harlem Heat, but the tag champions might need a bit of explanation. (1) Dirty Dick Slater is an old school legend who made a name for himself in Florida and Texas. He was noted for being tag team champions with Bob Orton Jr. as his partner, and yes, I find it absolutely hilarious that a guy named Dirty Dick was once partnered with a guy who had hepatitis. Of course, his bigger claim to fame was his tag team run with Dusty Rhodes in the late 70's. (2) Bunkhouse Buck is an old school legend from the Tennessee territory, where he wrestled under his real name of Jimmy Golden, and was part of Ron Fuller's Stud Stable. His WCW gimmick sounds like the most Southern version of a Kill Bill character possible. “My name is Bunkhouse Buck and I LOVE to Funkhouse ----!” (3) Both men started their wrestling careers in the late 60's, so at this point, they had nearly 60 years of combined experience. And were anchoring the tag division in 19-goddamn-95! And now, the match. History will remember Harlem Heat as one of the best tag teams in the promotion, and rightfully so, but this match was less about “let's have a 5 classic wrestling match”, and more about “let's create the most overbooked nonsense involving the weird relationship between each team's manager”. As a spoiler alert, as you'll come to see over the next couple of years, Harlem Heat was great, but unless they were doing squash matches, they worked almost exclusively in convoluted overbooked finishes. I might be exaggerating here, but if you watched like 10 consecutive hours of Harlem Heat matches, and took a shot every time they picked up a clean, no nonsense victory, you would be SO SOBER that if you got took a breathalyzer test right after, it'd tell you that your blood alcohol level was too LOW and you could probably use a drink or two! As a quick recap of the overbooked angle that was somehow more important than the title match itself, the relationship between Sherri and Parker was formed through sweet sweet sexual harassment. No, seriously! Parker would continually show up to try to mack on Sherri, only to get rebuffed every single time. Then during a Clash of Champions match, they got involved in a physical altercation which saw Sherri hit her head, and when she came to, she was suddenly SUPER IN LOVE with Parker all of a sudden! There's probably a ton more to this that I'm missing, but honestly that's the gist of it, and I wish it wasn't important enough for me to have to break it down in the first place because of how utterly stupid it all is, but alas, here we are! Now onto the match. As you'll see below, Meltzer took a huge sh-t all over this one, but I honestly think he was way too critical of it. It's not a lost classic or anything, but both members of Harlem Heat have this great intensity to everything they do and are obviously a top tier tag team even at this point in their careers, Slater and Buck might be way past their prime, but they're both still able to work a timeless Southern rasslin style that, while not exactly the most exciting thing in the world, is fantastic at generating heat, and is honestly still pretty awesome for those who grew up watching Memphis or Texas rasslin (or who would fall in love with it later in life like myself), and if we could have seen this play out without any overbooked nonsense factoring in, it might have been given at least a good 1/2 or 3/4 star from Dave. And now... Your wonky finish! While a 4 man cluster---- brawl occurs in the main ring, Sherri and Parker randomly decide to get into the second ring, they start making out. You'd think that this was crucial to the finish, but no, it only serves to distract US, the viewer, as we get a wide camera angle so we can see both rings at once, and then later pull AWAY FROM THE MATCH so we can see what the ----ing managers are up to! The ref gets distracted by some brawling going on outside of ring, and misses The Nasty Boys showing up. They get their hands on one of Slater's boots, not sure why it's off of his foot, but whatever, they blast Slater with the boot, and one of the Heat (I couldn't see which one because the camera was in wide angle mode) picks up the win, making Harlem Heat the new Tag champions. Note that Bunkhouse Buck was actually the legal man in the match, so... OOPS! One last fun note before we move on: although he was on the opposite side of the ring for this one, Harlem Heat actually debuted with the company (in dark matches only I believe) with Parker as their manager. At this point, their names were Kade and Kole. They were two black guys managed by an old timey plantation owner. And came to the ring WEARING CHAINS! HO...LY... SHT!!!! RESULTS: Harlem Heat def. Dirty Dick Slater &amp; Bunkhouse Buck via pinfall MELTZER RATING: *-\** I still think that's a bit unfair, match was a solid \* at worse, and honestly the crowd was into it. I don't care how jaded you are, or how much you jerk off to puroresu and ONLY puroresu (I'm talking to you Dave), NO match that is resonating with the crowd in a good way should be getting negative stars.

\-Okerlund is at the entrance way to meet Slater, Buck and Parker with an attempt to get their take on what happened, and Parker seems pretty fine with prioritizing “trying to get laid in the middle of the ring” over “being there to help his team win”. At no point does anyone involved in this point out that the WRONG \*\*\*\*ING MAN WAS PINNED, so... I guess it's just a “because WCW” moment?

\-We then move onto a SECOND Okerlund interview, this time with Arn Anderson, which is the biggest possible upgrade from those last two matches that I could ever imagine! Well, first we get a video package recapping the recent feud between the two men, which is helpful for those like myself who don't have access to all of the weekend tv shows building this PPV. Much like Flair earlier in the show, Arn does such an incredible job putting over the conflicting emotions of “I love this man like he were my own flesh and blood”, and “\*\*\*\* you, I'm on the right side of this conflict, and I'm going to force you to respect me and my perspective with physical violence!” Though to be fair, Arn could probably spend an entire promo just reading the periodic table of elements and I'd give him an A+.

5) ARN ANDERSON VS RIC FLAIR Hey, a match I don't have to give a ton of backstory to, because this angle was touched upon on Nitro, and if I have to explain who Ric Flair and Arn Anderson are, then I don't even know what to tell you! The simplest way to sum them up is “two guys with dad bods who are BETTER AT THIS THAN ALMOST ANYONE!” A really nice touch here is that when they pan to the crowd, a good chunk of the roster is actually IN the audience, watching this one as fans, how \*\*\*\*ing incredible is that? It's not something I'd want to see happen enough to become an ongoing trope, but how much more gravitas would it add to a big time WWE match if they had their notable wrestlers sitting at ringside to watch it for no purpose other than “this is going to be amazing and we have to see it up close”? It's basically every 90's Flair match ever, lots of Flair stalling and begging off, lots of Flair signature selling and spots, and if you think I'm complaining, then you're so far off the mark. And if you were to watch this match by not actually watching it, and only listening to the audio, you'd swear to God it was Austin in there, Arn is so over with the audience. Arn Anderson could very well be one of the best and most over wrestlers to never get a run with the top title, I swear. The audience is also equally into Flair, and it makes for a heel vs heel match that SOUNDS like a face vs face match if you listen to the crowd noise. It's a weird dynamic that shouldn't work, but considering the legendary status of both men involved, and the amount of love and respect they've earned over the years, it absolutely does. And then, because WCW, here's your absolutely not clean finish that makes no sense, but is a means to fuel an angle who's conclusion will (spoiler alert) ALSO make no sense! In the final stretch, there's a great long submission sequence where Flair has Arn in the Figure 4, and looks to have the match won until he spits in his face. This causes Arn to fire up enough to temporarily no sell the hold (and that's the key, TEMPORARILY! He didn't pull a Hogan and heal himself to 100% HP, his adrenaline just kicked in and allowed him to briefly ignore all pain. Take this lesson to heart please, every indie wrestler working now), and reverse it. Unfortunately for Arn, Flair is close to the ropes and is able to use them to break the hold. Doubly unfortunate for Double A, Flair is in fine shape, but Arn's knee is shot, he can barely get to his feet and move around in the ring. For reasons that I couldn't explain, super whitemeat babyface Brian Pillman runs out from the crowd, gets up on the apron and yells at Flair, then punches him in the face, and hits a very early version of Finn Balor's (and a million other indie guys now) rope assisted enzuigiri; this is all done behind the ref's back, as he's busy checking on Arn. Anderson scurries over as best as he can, hits the DDT, and picks up the win. So to summarize, one heel beat another heel because a babyface ran in and unexpectedly helped him cheat? Because... WCW? Still, fantastic match, another one I suggest you all go out of your way to watch. RESULTS: Arn Anderson def. Ric Flair via pinfall MELTZER RATING: \*\*\*1/2, which seems a bit low to me, but that's just my non-star giving opinion.

\-Hooboy, this should be a treat, we get a Kevin Sullivan narrated video package hyping up the War Games main event. Sullivan is a tremendous talker, but this sh\*t is so hokey that I don't even think The Rock at his peak could have delivered this without sounding like a \*\*\*\*ing goober. Needless to say, I love it. Just the sight of Sullivan SMASHING A HULK HOGAN TOY WITH A \*\*\*\*ING SHOVEL alone is enough to make me want to go full Meltzer whacking it to a Tokyo Done match and give it \*\*\*\*\*\*1/2. The follow up WCW narrated video package is not quite as good, but still freaking awesome/hokey.

\-Backstage, Okerlund gets to interview Hogan, Savage, Sting and Luger, who are decked out in camo outfits and face paint, and according to Hogan have been drinking Agent Orange. Hahaha, holy sh-t, is THAT the secret to Hogan's skin color?!?!?! Despite the narrative at the end of Monday being “Luger is Dungeon Of Doom maybe but Sting and Luger say he isn't?”, the babyfaces say they're all on the same page, and then Hogan IMMEDIATELY sh-ts on that by saying that they DIDN'T trust each other just a few minutes ago, but Macho set him straight by pulling a Stone Cold, saying “DTA, don't trust anybody”, and just focus on beating the Dungeon of Doom so Hogan gets 5 minutes alone with Sullivan. Hahahaha, what the \*\*\*\*?!?!?! All 4 guys sounded like they were on all the drugs here, which made this confusing at times, but pretty great honestly.

6) MAIN EVENT – WAR GAMES: THE DUNGEON OF DOOM (MENG, KAMALA, SHARK, ZODIAC, W/KEVIN SULLIVAN) VS HULK HOGAN, STING, MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE, AND LEX LUGER (W/JIMMY HART) For those who are unfamiliar with the War Games rules, I'll sum them up here as quick as I can. Each team starts with one member in the cage, for 5 minutes, at which point one team (the one who won a pre-match coin toss, always the heels every damn time) sends in their second. Every two minutes from there, each team alternates sending in a member until all 8 men are in the cage and then THE MATCH BEYOND starts. It's only then that the match can be won, but only by submission or surrender. Needless to say, this quickly becomes too much of a cluster\*\*\*\* for me to review properly, so I'll break down the entrance orders, and point out any notable/important moments. -We start with Sting vs Shark, which is probably just as exciting as you imagine it to be. Lots of Shark using his power and fatness to very... slowly... dominate... Sting... until he swings the action back into his favor with an AWESOME spot, charging with a flying clothesline that knocks both of them over the top rope and into the OTHER ring. Fan-\*\*\*\*ing-tastic! Not as fantastic (but still hilariously awesome) is Shark trying to \*\*\*\*ing plancha over the top ropes of BOTH rings, but getting caught on top of both top ropes, because he's TOO FAT! -Shockingly, the heels one the coin toss (GASP!), and Zodiac is the second man to enter, because this match needed more Brutus the \*\*\*\*ing Barber Beefcake cosplaying a \*\*\*\*ing zebra who alternates between yelling “YES” and “NO”. -Macho Man is second in for the faces, which vastly increases the workrate capacity of this match. Except it's War Games, so it's all brawling anyway, oh well! -Third in for the heels is Kamala, which vastly increases the fat man quotient of this match. Holy ----, could you imagine someone trying to get the Kamala gimmick over in 2018? Could you imagine how much internet outrage would happen over trying to get “mindless African jungle savage/cannibal” to work? I think the only thing MORE offensive to everyone would be trying to get the Memphis Kamala 2 gimmick over, which was (I sh-t you not) “Kamala, but a white guy”! -In a moment that would be ironic when you think about what happens in the summer of 96, Hogan is NOT the third man tonight, Luger gets that nod. Yes, I just wanted to make an nWo joke there. Also, the babyfaces fall apart briefly due to accidental hitting, because OF COURSE THEY DO! -This means Meng is second last out, and Hogan's out last, because of COURSE Hogan is the one who's going to do the least ----ing work in this match. He hits the ring with HANDFULLS OF WHITE POWDER, and it makes sense because I'm sure that 100% of these Dungeon Of Doom storylines are booked by snorting copious amounts of the stuff. -Now as mentioned above, once everyone is in the match, it can only end by submission. The faces have Sting with his Scorpion Death Lock, and Luger with the Torture Rack, so how do you think this one is ending? If you guessed “Master of submission Hulk Hogan takes down all 4 Dungeon members by himself with sh-tty offense, takes roughly 0 bumps, and after less than 2 minutes of action (for which he'll get paid LOTS of money), makes Zodiac submit with a \*\*\*\*ing CHINLOCK”, then... Well, then I'll probably accuse you of having seen this before because of how specific (and correct) that guess is. He sets the chinlock up like he's going for a Camel Clutch but nope, straight up Steiner Recliners it by letting Zodiac kind of sit up on his knees, instead of lay out as fast as possible and have his back stretched into an arc. This is somehow the least frustrating Hogan match I've ever covered though, so... small victory? RESULTS: Hulk Hogan def. The Dungeon Of Doom via submission (his partners were there too) MELTZER RATING: \*1/4

\-Now Hogan gets 5 minutes alone in the cage with Sullivan, and if you're wondering why I'm not counting this as a bonus match or the main event or anything, well, this is really more of a post-match angle than it is a match. Lots of Hogan slamming Sullivan's head into the cage (even though the REAL way to damage someone with a steel cage is to rub their face against it like a cheese grater), they somehow go outside, then lots of Hogan slamming Sullivan's head into the OUTSIDE of the cage. And then, out from the back comes The Giant, the very first form of the current Big Show, here being presented as the son of Andre The Giant because... WCW? Somehow this literal giant manages to fight past the referee to get into the cage, SNEAK UP ON HULK HOGAN, choke him, no sell Hogan punches (HOW DOES IT FEEL YOU \*\*\*\*ING ORANGE \*\*\**ING D*CKBAG?!?!?!), and then BREAKS HIS \*\*\*ING NECK!!!!! I don't mean that in a hyperbolic “he piledriver'd him so hard that I bet his neck is broken” way, I mean that as in he puts both hands on Hogan's head and does a big, action movie style exaggerated neck snap! The rest of Hogan's friends only come out for the save AFTER the crippling, because even they probably don't like Hulk that much, plus they know he'll no sell a broken neck anyway. So that's how we choose to end the PPV. Hulk Hogan is possibly dead, or paralyzed, be sure to tune in to see how Hogan takes a sh-t on that narrative in the coming weeks, and how this storyline becomes one of the most ridiculous things I'll ever cover!

PPV BUYRATE: 0.48 Good GAWD! Even though this was a much better show, that's like half the amount of PPV buys as Uncensored did! I'd love to know what kind of excuse Hogan had for his War Games main event being such a sh\*t draw.

HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: I'm honestly torn between Pillman/Badd, and Flair/Anderson. Both were amazing in different ways, and both are absolute standouts on the card. Ultimately, I'm giving the nod to Pillman/Badd, though it's by a slim margin. Both matches were rich as far as in ring storytelling goes, the opener had that plus being super exciting going for it and just barely gets the edge in my books.

LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: The pointlessness that was Pittman/Cobra. Seriously, did that even need to be a match? Wouldn't it have accomplished just as much if it were done as an angle?

NEXT WEEK: Ric Flar gets a little Fall Brawl revenge as he takes on Brian Pillman!! In a not at all similar to this storyline showcase of “good friends suddenly have an issue with each other”, Razor Ramon takes on  1-2-3 Kid! They used to be allies, but they never DID seem to... KLIQ properly. Ahem. Don't you dare miss it!

Unfortunately for me, that's about to change.

I stride through the office, my tight pencil skirt showing off my ass and stocking clad legs, my tight blazer hugging the curves of my breasts, a small triangle of my thin, cream coloured blouse visible at the top. My shoulder length blonde hair is bound tightly behind my head, not a wisp out of place, and my tall black heels click menacingly on the faux wood floor.

I see people hunker down, doing their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I enjoy having power over the people who work under me, and I never hesitate to exploit it. I pause at the door to my large office, turning on my heel and clearing my throat loudly.

""As you all know, we'll be holding annual performance reviews this week. I'll call you to my office when it's your turn""

I can almost feel the mood in the office grow tenser, any hints of a smile quickly wiping themselves off their respective faces. My own smile widens as I turn back to enter my office, snapping my fingers at me secretary to bring me coffee and checking my schedule briefly - a new group of interns was arriving later that day.

___________________________________________________

Put my in my place. Make me your bitch.

Who you are is up to you - one of my employees, fed up with the ridiculous standards I construct for the annual review? My secretary, tired of being thrown the most menial tasks? A young intern who I try to seduce using my position as leverage only to have the tables turned on me?

Or maybe you're not from the office at all - you could be the head of a larger company, looking to take over another smaller one - and add another slut to her harem. Or a reporter who turns up dirt on the company and uses it to blackmail me. Or anybody else you want to be! Feel free to combine or modify any of my ideas as well!

My ultimate fate is up to you - will I be your personal slave, obeying your every command without question? Or maybe the company slut - spreading my legs to help you close business deals. Maybe you'll just slip a collar on me and keep me chained in the corner of the office as I watch you become more successful than I ever was.

As you can probably tell, I love having control taken from me, or being seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and humiliated in public settings and verbally abused.

Bondage, foot worship, petplay, and forced tattooing/piercing/branding are all things I'd be interested in including, but definitely optional if they're not up your alley or don't work with what you want to do. 

Not a huge fan of toilet play, but most other things are very welcome, so feel free to slip in any fetishes you like!

9ki4zi,16,2018-10-01,What are you like when angry?,WoodpeckerNo1,isfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/9ki4zi/what_are_you_like_when_angry/,"So, about an hour ago or so, my boss at my internship (ESTP) flipped out at me in a really nasty passive-aggressive way for browsing reddit (which is odd, since he never minds it, and I've been working all day) at the last 5 minutes of the day. This kind of behavior kinda scares me at first, but once it's over I'm the one who gers angry. 

So, that got me thinking, everyone seems to have certain habits when they are angry. My boss calmly, but in a really serious tone basically asks you ""what are you doing?"" and then once you give him an answer he pretty much verbally tears you apart in a passive-aggressive way, and tells you to continue your work. In my case, I am usually in some sort of shock at first, I get shaky and I'm some sort of scared, and after that I get really grumpy and start having thoughts in which I'm beating up the one I'm angry at, or think of ways to get revenge. I also pretty much completely ignore them when they say something, unless it's important, in which case I just reply curt and professionally. Outside of that, I try not too look grumpy or angry, because in my experience that will just make them point it out and continue harassing you. I can't muster a happy face either, so I just settle for a neutral face."

At the beginning of this Semester was feeling great, last year had been by best year school-wise ever, I have done things and improved my social skills to the point where high school me would not recognize, had recently spent a month and a half abroad and I had a enjoyable successful summer internship. 

But recently everything has gone down hill. I am terrified of graduating college and losing the only real support system outside my family I have ever known, my self esteem was broke. In high school by bullies and the religious propaganda, but when I got to college I discovered that I was that people like being around me and have began to grow more confident and act out less. I’m terrified that I won’t be able to replicate it in the real world and will return to isolation.

I also began taking my ADHD meds when I came back, I haven’t taken them since high school when they made me to unbearably anxious, but I stupidly thought that it would be helpful now I’m in a better place. Over the last week I locked myself in my room and didn’t show up to any classes or turn in my hw because I was constantly having panic attack’s and was barely able to go downstairs. One night I took 3 to get my hw done but I ended up feeling like I was going to have a heart attack. I kept smoking weed and drinking to numb me but that just made things worse. I’ve now been sober from all 3 for 48 hours and already feel better and am catching up

I’m now far behind in one of my classes, I don’t know what to tell my teachers, and am all together terrified that I’m retiring to the same self destructive tendencies that almost forced me out of High school. I just feel destroyed right now by everything going on around me and an barely function.

9kixvs,15,2018-10-01,Considering Marriage with Catholic Girl,zakoroo,Christianmarriage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/9kixvs/considering_marriage_with_catholic_girl/,"I have begun dating a Catholic girl, Ruth (made up name). Ruth and I met at work and we are already discussing marriage early on. We are both relatively young, she is about to graduate college (she is an intern) and I have been working professionally for \~3 years, so she is about 3 years younger. We are both in our early 20's.   


I come from a very conservative and traditional Protestant background (PCA) which can be very strict on their values and the way in which the church lives. I think I can identify a lot with Ruth since she had a very similar up-bringing in the Catholic church which is strong in their views on tradition and a lot of small rules to follow.  


We were both homeschooled and grew up with conservative values and have the same exact views about marriage, children, politics, social issues, etc. The only difference is that her family is deeply Catholic and my family is deeply Protestant.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not told my parents about Ruth, but my father in particular would scare me as he believes all Catholics, regardless of their views on salvation, are going to hell. I am not sure where my mother stands, but she would probably agree with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ruth's parents are a little younger than my parents and seem more open about her dating a non-Catholic, she told me, ""as long as you are open to Catholicism, they would accept you"". I am not sure what this means.  


I have told her, I think as the relationship progresses, it will be me constantly trying to pull her towards Protestantism, and she constantly trying to pull me towards Catholicism.  


She said she wants to continue dating and figure things out as we go and eventually move toward marriage. I am wondering if it would be better to end things now before we dig ourselves too deep into a hole. I think right now I am the only one that can see clearly of the two of us. She is deeply in love with me and I don't think she can see the future conflicts that may arise, especially between our families.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Ruth is an amazing girl and she would definitely lay down her life for me. I am not sure if I would be tossing away an amazing girl for her being Catholic?  


As far as where I stand, I can never see myself becoming Catholic. I may be open to going to mass every now and then, but I would not become Catholic. I am scared that what is a small issue right now, would become even more deeply complicated if we were to get married and then have kids. I could not live a divided life.

I am sure others have been through something like this, but any advice would be greatly appreciated."
9kiy4d,14,2018-10-01,1st year Staff and 1 month in I think this is a terrible career choice for me. Am I just a whimp?,CauselessRebellion,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9kiy4d/1st_year_staff_and_1_month_in_i_think_this_is_a/,"Little background: I just graduated this past summer with my BComm. in Accounting. I got an offer last year (2017) during fall recruiting with a small CPA firm (less than 30 people) to start last month.

However, as I was finishing my degree I (somehow, don't ask me how) landed an 8-month internship offer (Jan. to August) of this past year, working in IT as an Agile Product Owner/Business Analyst in the Banking sector. Despite not having any technical background as far as software goes, I love IT and all things tech so I dove head first, picked things up quickly on the fly and I performed well at my internship and was very well received by my peers. I loved everything about it and the people who I'm still quite close with.

Even though I knew that my internship would be winding down and I'd be starting my full-time career now in Public Accounting, I didn't think I would miss my last job this much. I literally hate my life for the past month. Not just the learning curve- which is fine and to be expected- but how incredibly mundane all of this is. Staring at spreadsheets and bookkeeping/tax software for 8-9 hours and accruing billables just seems so soul-crushing. Keying in bank transactions for recs., I literally find myself looking out the window downtown and looking down and envying the Baristas at the Starbucks in the adjacent building.

I know that people will say that this is normal and that I'll get through it- but I am having a difficult time rationalizing my career when my heart's not really set here at all. I've already started job searching hard for positions that pay comparably and have more of a customer service/sales/engagement component to it. I'm going crazy not moving my body or talking to people.

TL;DR- I think I'm in the wrong career but am I just being a little bitch by not sucking it up? Any feedback- good or bad- appreciated. Thanks. :)"

Randomly and suddenly reveal cover art for an unnamed album. You’ve got one or two songs sort of done? Well then you’re ready to promote on all social media channels, and maybe run a marketing campaign on a few billboards, posters, etc. Don’t worry, you don’t need to finish the album - you just need to build hype. 

2. Choose something meta and simple, maybe recycle an old idea from a school project or friend and change it a little bit so no one really cares much. Could be something one of your interns found off of Google and then just do some basic colour grading and throw a lil’ coloured label on there. Perfect! Now people will truly believe it’s completed and polished.

3. Now that you’ve started the promotional campaign and everyone is anticipating your release? It’s time to pick a date! Don’t think too much about it, you’re not really gonna release it or follow through. You just want everyone to think you’re going to. 

4. You’ve got cover art, a title, and hype! What more do you need?! Well, a live performance doesn’t hurt! Why not invite a friend and dress up like your favourite beverage and mumble in front of a crowd for one to two minutes. Don’t worry! Just like everything else, you don’t really have to put any effort into it. It’s all just a big joke anyways.

5. After the performance, everyone will be so excited to hear the album and talk about the release. So? Fuck ‘em! Totally ghost everyone. Tweet out a couple thoughts and just pretend like you never even talked about an album. Maybe visit a kids football team at a diner and just silently pan the table a few times. Take a selfie of your cool new hat. Album? What album! 

6. After a day or two of random thoughts and the occasional rant about how you’re the next Steve Jobs, you’ll probably want to satisfy your angry fans. So, release that joke song again! You know the one you danced around as a water bottle to on a nationally syndicated network? Yeah, release that as a censored and completely atrocious edit. Literally nobody wants that! No one is asking for it! So, give it to ‘em. 

7. Finally, once you’ve passed the 48 hour threshold, it’s time to cast blame to someone else. You didn’t miss the deadline! What deadline! Find someone to tell the world that there will be a delay and you might need a few days, weeks, or months to start ... errr ... complete your highly anticipated album. A friend, a colleague. Hell, best to go with your wife and the mother of your three children. That way, when people start to angrily cuss you out - you won’t have to deal with all those nasty notifications. 

I hope this guide helped you better understand the nuances of the industry and provided you with some helpful tips and tricks to release your next hit album!

There will be over 90 companies especially the big four accounting firms. I am currently looking for a internship with any of the big four companies and other companies that I might be interested in. The reason I want to attend is to gain experience and to really see if this accounting professsion is for me. I just turned 21 back in July and I really feel like I don't know if I chose the right career/major which is creating massive amounts of anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, I have been looking at employee reviews from these companies like the big four and more by looking at websites such as [GlassDoor.com](https://GlassDoor.com) and I have to say that I am quite terrifed of this corporate world because of the long hours and stress that many of these employees go through. In the future, I wish to become an entrepreneur and start my own business (which I still have no idea what I want to do), which is why I thought by studying accounting I could really use those tools in my journey.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, what are somethings I can say to stand out because I only have 30-60 seconds to give them an idea of who I am. Also, what advice would you give a young adult like myself if you were in my shoes."
9kji8d,2,2018-10-01,Premed Transfer,regretsyndrome,jhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/9kji8d/premed_transfer/,"Hi! I'd appreciate any thoughts at all, as I'm currently completely lost.

I declared my major as Compsci as an incoming freshman, but I'm planning to change my major and go premed. The thing is, the cost of attending this institution is hefty, much more than if I were to go to an in-state school. Obviously, the best financial option would be for me to transfer to a college close to home, but I would also like to consider the importance of institution and prestige for med school acceptances. Do you think a 3.8+ GPA at a public university (ranked around 130) would carry the same weight as a 3.5 at Hopkins?

In terms of performance, I also believe I could manage a much higher GPA at the state school than Hopkins. Of course, there may be less resources, but I believe I could be more successful at home with a strong support system (friends and family) and more time outside of studying to intern, volunteer, etc. However, Hopkins obviously offers better pre-health advising and world-renown opportunities although it is also much more competitive, what with a student body populated with intelligent and ambitious individuals. I am currently under the impression that if I go back home, I'll have a better chance to stand out and maintain a solid GPA, but I'm reluctant to give up because of Hopkins' opportunities and prestige.

Thank you to everyone who read all the way through, and I'd be super grateful if anyone offered up their opinion!"

We first met in my junior year while she was a freshman. and began dating shortly after. She was my first and what i hoped to be my only romantic relationship. For more background info the first two years of our relationship were nearly perfect by both of our accounts. We were madly in love with each other and there seemingly would never be a day where we didnt spend at least 2 hours together. Even though we were both broke college students, I managed to get a well paying internship my senior year which allowed us to go to beaches, ski resorts, etc during our breaks. Even our low points in the relationship were resolved almost immediately because we were both able to sit down together and rationalize effective solutions or compromises. I graduated the summer of 2017 and was offered a job by the same company I interned for. This was perfect for us because that meant we could rent an apartment near her campus for a year while she completed her last year and I would only have a 20 minute commute from the apartment to work. Like with our vacations and most other expenses, I had agreed to cover the entire cost of rent for our apartment. Looking back, I realized the only time she has ever contributed money to a date or something we have done together was during the first few months of our relationship when I didn't have an internship. I dont know why our how Ive allowed this to be the norm of our relationship but so it is. She has never held a job during our relationship but to be fair to her she claimed to be very busy with school and a paid internship within her field is very rare. 

&amp;#x200B;

Getting to the main issue now. About a month after I graduated she and a few of her friends went to a night club near campus while I was out of state helping my parents move out of their house. We have never had trust issues or cheating issues so one of us going out without the other was nothing out of the ordinary. While she was out clubbing, we were texting each other quite a bit. Then suddenly around 12:30 AM she tops responding and I figure shes just having fun with her friends to text back. I go to sleep and wake up around 8. Still no text back. I am a little concerned but in the past shes slept until 4pm whenever she partied the night before. I then spend the next several hours helping my parents. During this time I also text her memes which is what I normally do. Still no response. It is now 5pm and im very worried and I reached out to her best friend that she said she went to the club with. Her friend told me that lucy got blackout drunk and that they had to drag her back to her apartment and help her vomit and all that jazz. I am relieved hearing this and then text the friend some other questions like ""how many shots did she take lol"" just to make idle convo. She then shuts me down tensely and texts ""if you want to know what happened, ask her not me"" and stops responding. I am very bewildered by her response but lucy woke up and texted me 2 minutes after i got that text from her friend.  She told me she got very drunk last night and was feeling very sick from a hangover and that her phone died at the club so she couldn't text me back until now. she said that everything was fine and that she misses me and wants me home soon. The next day I come home and she starts breaking down in tears and told me she got sexually assaulted at the club. I am absolutely mortified and start crying a bit as well. We spend the entire day cuddling in bed as she cries. She wouldn't tell me much of what specifically happened and I didn't push her to as I figured it would be traumatic for her. From the little she did tell me she got groped multiple times be an unknown person (or persons) and she couldn't tell who was doing it because the club was very packed and dark. The day after I told her maybe we should got to the police or maybe even club management. She started freaking out and screaming that if we go public with this info everyone will label her as a whore. I seeked help from sexual assault forums and the common consensus was to just give her time and to listen to her if she doesn't want to go to the police. I felt so helpless and devastated for her that I couldn't let it stand. I went behind her back and talked to my friend who is a club bartender that worked the night lucy was at the club. I didn't disclose to him that lucy got sexually assaulted. I simply told him that she and her friend group was getting verbally harassed by a guy (or guys) and I wanted to know what had happened. He told me he didn't notice any harassment and that the times he did see lucy it seemed like she was absolutely enjoying herself.  However he told me a troubling detail that when lucy first entered the club she didnt arrive with a group of her usual girlfriends. She arrived with her best friend and two guys he didn't recognize. I was very perplexed by this because lucy had specifically told me she was going with 4 of her GIRLfriends. So unless my friend was mistaken or lying, something was up. I asked whether he saw her dancing with the guys who came with her and he said he wasn't really paying attention so he couldn't say. I lied to Lucy and told her I coincidentally ran into my friend the bartender and he told me she was at the club with two guys and why she lied to me about going with her girlfriends. She completely lashed out at me and screamed how dare I bring up that traumatizing night again and started to sob like crazy. After about 30 minutes she started to calm a bit and told me she didnt lie and she did in fact go with all the friends she claimed she did and that I could text any one of them right now for confirmation. She told me that the group had met those two guys while waiting in line outside the club and they offered to buy the girls drinks. She then dropped a bombshell on me that one of the guys had in fact sexually assaulted her but that didnt change the fact she didn't want to go public with the information as she was scared of what the world would think of her. She told me the only ones who knew what happened were me, her, her best friend, and the assaulter. She told me his name was Hank but that she didn't know anything else about him. She make me swear to her I will let it all go and that we will all move on. Several months pass and it is now present day and her and all her friends have graduated. A week ago I received a text from her best friend claiming that we need to talk asap. We meet up and she pretty much tells me that lucy is now hanging out with the man who assaulted her at the club. I am absolutely dumbfounded and demand proof. She said she cannot give me anything substantial other than the fact she has seen the pair together multiple times. She said she had known about them hanging out for months and was wrapped with guilt and finally told me now. She didn't give me any other info other than i should maybe check lucy's phone for proof.  I go straight home and see that my gf is taking a nap. I use her thumbprint to get into her phone (scummy I know) and go through all her messages. I notice a chat between her and someone named madison. There are only 4 messages in this chat so theres a chance messages were deleted. The messages were basically how lucy said she had a great time yesterday and she hopes that theyll have a chance to meet again soon. ""madison"" replies with ""I cant wait either baby"" and a kissing emoji. Lucy told me she was going to the mall with her friends yesterday. So unless she went with a friend who ive never met named madison something is up. Its been a few days since I went through her phone. I need advice as to what to do next please help me.

I hope to god this isn't what it seems

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr GF claims to have been sexually assaulted at a club by someone she didn't know. After sometime she confesses that she did know who it was but makes me swear not to report it to anyone. Now her best friend has revealed to me my GF is hanging out with the man she claims sexually assaulted her. "
9kjpro,2,2018-10-01,State School or hopkins premed,regretsyndrome,medschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medschool/comments/9kjpro/state_school_or_hopkins_premed/," 

Hi! I'd appreciate any thoughts at all, as I'm currently completely lost.

I declared my major as Compsci as an incoming freshman, but I'm planning to change my major and go premed. The thing is, the cost of attending this institution is hefty, much more than if I were to go to an in-state school. Obviously, the best financial option would be for me to transfer to a college close to home, but I would also like to consider the importance of institution and prestige for med school acceptances. Do you think a 3.8+ GPA at a public university (ranked around 130) would carry the same weight as a 3.5 at Hopkins?

In terms of performance, I also believe I could manage a much higher GPA at the state school than Hopkins. Of course, there may be less resources, but I believe I could be more successful at home with a strong support system (friends and family) and more time outside of studying to intern, volunteer, etc. However, Hopkins obviously offers better pre-health advising and world-renown opportunities although it is also much more competitive, what with a student body populated with intelligent and ambitious individuals. I am currently under the impression that if I go back home, I'll have a better chance to stand out and maintain a solid GPA, but I'm reluctant to give up because of Hopkins' opportunities and prestige.

Thank you to everyone who read all the way through, and I'd be super grateful if anyone offered up their opinion!"
9kjqee,1,2018-10-01,Memories (Unfinished),megatroid13,shortstory,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/9kjqee/memories_unfinished/,"I answered the frantic knocking almost immediately. The door was right next to my favorite overstuffed recliner where I was prone to do all my brooding.  There was a lot of that now.  I was surprised to see her.  She looked a complete mess: her hands clenched at her sides and her teeth worrying a hole into her lip.  Her tiny body was covered in an oversized t-shirt and fraying jean shorts.  Her hair was piled up on her head and there was left over mascara smudged under her eyes.  I knew I owed her an explanation but I didn’t know how.  Words of apology were fighting their way out of her mouth, but I was mesmerized with the simple way her lips formed the phrases.  She began to rub the bridge of her nose, an unconscious gesture, and I knew she was either frustrated or about to cry. Looking into her eyes I knew it was the latter.  We had both been angry, but now that we were together and I was once again looking at her I couldn’t remember why.  

“Did you want to come in?” I finally broke the silence.  I couldn’t stand the way she stood there, like this wasn’t her house too.

“Can I?”

I nodded and she crossed her arms over her chest as she hesitantly walked in. She looked at the wall with the photos of us as if she had never seen it before.  

“Six months,” I mumbled as I grabbed two glasses from the cupboard.  I could still see her standing by the door looking at the photo of us dancing at her sister’s wedding.  This was her home, but she was a stranger.

“Should have been longer, but I uh…” she trailed off as she turned towards me. 

“Water?”

“Sure,” she moved down the line of photos.  The sound of the ice hitting the bottom of each glass was the only sound in the room.  

“Remember those birds?  The ones we thought were falcons?  They were turkey vultures.  I can’t believe—”

“What are you doing here?” I interrupted her, handing her a glass of water.  She exhaled long and heavy, took a sip of water, then exhaled again.  I counted the ticks of the clock on the other wall.  *Forty-five, forty-six, forty-seven…*

“I needed to see you,” she shrugged.

I don’t think she realized she was torturing me.  We were acting like strangers but I knew all the little details about her.  I knew she was nervous so the roof of her mouth would be itchy and her palms would be clammy.  I knew if I responded that I had needed to see her too she would chew on her thumbnail and pretend she was mulling it over.  I knew if I responded that I had moved on she would hold her head high and walk out.  I knew that would break her.

“Well, go on,” I sat down in my recliner.  She pulled a bar stool closer to me, but not too close.  She was a safe distance.  Her movements stirred the air and I could smell her perfume.  My heart thudded in tune with the ticking clock. I counted to one hundred and seventy-two before she started talking again.

“Six months,” I nodded in agreement with her statement of the obvious.  “It doesn’t seem that long.  I guess we left it on a bad note.”  That was the understatement of the century.  The air conditioner started blowing and she cleared her throat before she continued.  “I don’t know why it’s so tense.  I mean…we were friends once.”

“Friends?” I scoffed.  

“Maybe more than that.”

“I guess you forgot your name was on this lease too.”

“I send you the money.” Her voice remained calm while I was pressing my anger and absolute hurt into my toes.  “I’ve never missed a payment.”

“Did you get your own place?”

“Yeah, about an hour from here.  Not as nice as this, but it works.  How’s the job?” the small talk was killing me.

“Thinking about quitting,” I laughed to myself.  I *had*been thinking this but hadn’t said it out loud yet.  She always got the truth out of me without even trying.

“Why’s that funny?”

“Just is.”  I was through talking.  If she wanted to explain herself she could, but I didn’t need to explain anything.

She traced the rim of the cup with her thumb.  I couldn’t stop starring at her fingers.  I remembered how well they fit in between mine.  Every detail was killing me.  All the feelings rushed back and I could almost feel her nails raking over my skin.  I shivered.

“…closure.  Hey, did you even hear me?” I didn’t realize she was talking.  I had been spiraling back into past memories.  “You can’t keep zoning out on me.”  I could tell she was beginning to lose her temper.  “I came here because I need closure.” 

“What, like on us?  I thought everything was tied up pretty nicely with a big fat bow when you took off.”

“I owe you more than that.”

“You don’t owe me anything,” the words came out quiet and heartfelt.  How could she owe me?  We went through hell and back.

“He’s a good man,” her words stabbed me like knives.  I was expecting them to come eventually but I still wasn’t prepared for the physical pain they would put me through.  “He takes care of me.  I’m thinking about moving out there with him, you know, to Kansas.”

“You wouldn’t like it there,” I couldn’t stop the words.

“You don’t know me anymore.  You haven’t known me since the scare.”  She was talking about the baby.  Well, there didn’t end up being one, it was just that, a scare.  Funny how we talked about it like it was a monumental occasion: “the scare”.  But I guess for us it was, it was the beginning to the end.  Again, her words cut like knives.  I was supposed to know her better than anyone.  I did know her better than I knew anyone else, but she wasn’t the same girl I was in love with.  I couldn’t help the anger that flared up when I thought about all the years I had wasted on her.

“Why you gotta bring that up?  You’re always bringing that up.  I didn’t push you away.  I was here for you.  You know that just as well as I do.  You’re the one who didn’t think you could be a mother.”

I didn’t want to hurt her but her words were barely a whisper, “you’re right,” she stared down at the ice melting in her cup.  Florida was hot in the summer.  She liked the heat, that’s why I knew she wouldn’t like Kansas too much. It snowed there.  “I remember when we bought that,” she nodded her head towards my recliner.  I tried to avoid it but her words took me spiraling back two years prior.  

“You’ve got to admit it, this one is way nicer than the other one,” her voice was more carefree, more…alive.

“I don’t know this one only has one cup holder.  What if I’m watching the game and I need extra room?”

“We’ll get the side table.  Look, look how comfy I am,” she stretched her arms up over her head and yawned.  She crossed her ankles and gave me a goofy smile. I shook my head in defeat.  “We’ll take it,” she smiled up at the sales associate.

“I wish we had gotten the other one,” her voice snapped me out of my daydream. And with those eight words she ruined one of the last happy memories I had with her.

“Are you going to tell me why you’re here?” I was getting inpatient and frankly a little cranky.  “Stop bringing up all this stuff from the past.”

“But that’s all we have.  Just the past.”

“If you wanted to talk about the past you should have called your sister. Don’t come running to me.”

“You know I loved you,” her words were so sudden they jolted me to the edge of my seat.  “I did. Maybe you don’t think so, ‘cause I left, but I loved you.”

“Why do you think I want to hear this?  Write it in your diary, scribble it on a post-it, I don’t care.  It doesn’t mean anything.”

She stood up and walked over to me, digging something out of the front pocket of her shorts.  “Here, it’s early.” She sniffed and tried to hide the wiping of a few tears as she handed me a white envelope.  “Lease is up next month.  Take my name off.” And with that she walked out and slammed the door.  

I sat, my arm still outstretched from taking the white envelope, the other hand becoming increasingly wet from my cup’s condensation.  I could hear her car start, could hear the tires crunching on the gravel driveway as it turned.  I wanted to run after her.  I wanted to apologize and tell her I loved her too.  That wasn’t an option though, she had him, didn’t need me.

I sat there for at least an hour before I saw her glass was leaving a ring on the fake wood floor.  I leaned in close to inspect the damage and wipe away the water with the edge of my shirt. I’d have to move the rug to cover it up. Just another pockmark on the floor, most of them were caused by her anyway.  She always wore those stupid high heels, clomping around the house like she was a model, scuffing up the floor.  Probably lost the deposit by now, not that it mattered.  I knew I didn’t want to live in this house anymore once the lease was up.  The ghost of her and the memories we had together haunted this place and if I didn’t get out soon I knew I would go crazy.  Maybe I already had gone crazy.  I had to be.  There was no way she would actually come see me.

But I looked down to the envelope in my hand and the new ring on the floor—actual physical evidence she had been here.  When she left she took everything except for the photos.  She swept the apartment clean of herself and completely left my life.  She removed six years of herself in less than six hours.  Now I would have to deal with the emotional devastation that her sixty minutes back in this house would cause me.

It’s not like I did not try to get over her.  It had only been six months and I’d been on a few dates but I found myself comparing all others to her.  In order to be fair to them I just gave up.  Not forever of course, I knew she was never coming back so I knew I’d find someone but just…not now.  I needed to go through my stages of grief.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know what came over me to go see him like that.  I showed up on his doorstep unannounced, of course he had every reason to be mad.  Now I had an hour drive back to my apartment, a dinner to make for Royce, and a stack of papers to grade.  Visiting him was the stupidest decision I’d made all week, or month I guess.  He looked good though.  He looked at least two years older than last time I’d seen him, I guess the new job was really aging him.  I knew he’d hate it.  He just wasn’t cut out for office work.  I wondered how I looked to him.  It had been six months but if he’d changed that much I’m sure I had too.

The glare of headlights on the road focused my attention back to driving and I flipped on the radio to occupy my mind.  Royce was only here for the weekend and here I was visiting my ex.  I told him I was going to see my grandmother in the hospital and that he didn’t need to come.  He should instead finish up his paperwork.  She *was*in the hospital; I didn’t lie.  But I didn’t go see her.

*He*had every right to be mad at me.  I could tell, his brow scrunching up, that he was trying not to be angry.  It was stupid and reckless.  Tears pricked at my eyes.  I laughed as I wiped one away.  More tears for him, like I hadn’t cried enough.  Royce would be mad if he knew.  I wasn’t supposed to get worked up, especially over him.  

I methodically made the way back to my apartment.  Pulled into the gate, parked, grabbed the few dry goods I stopped to get from my trunk.  I don’t know why I didn’t insist on living on the first floor.  The three flights of stairs were really brutal.  Royce was still sitting at the table typing away on his laptop.  He looked up and smiled at me.

“How is she?”

“Doing better, I think she’ll be there for at least another week.  Beer?” I hid behind the refrigerator door as I lied through my teeth.

“Sure, what’s for dinner?”

I grabbed two beers from the fridge and popped off the tops, the fizz popping on my wrist.  

“Kinda tired, do you want to just order in?” I sank down into the kitchen chair across from him and slid the bottle over to him.

“You look beat.”

“I feel it.”

“Everything go okay?” he could tell I was hiding something.  He was always so good at reading me.

“Just a little stressed.  I haven’t told her I’m moving yet.”

“She’ll understand.  Your sister moved to Canada.”

“She got married first,” I raised my eyebrow as I took a sip of the beer.

“In due time,” he turned back to his laptop and I knew the conversation was over.  I sat quietly and drank the rest of the beer while watching out the window.  I could see the pool and even though it was dark there were teenagers crowded around the grills.  I knew *him*as a teenager.  We went to the same school.  That’s why no one was surprised when we went to the same college and fell in love, or whatever it was we did.  I loved him, but I’m not sure if he ever truly loved me back.  I think Royce loves me.  He wants me to move in with him and says he wants to marry me eventually.  

That’s what *he*had said in college too though. 

“Chinese or pizza?” Royce asked.

“Let’s do pizza tonight.”

We ate quietly.  Everything with Royce was quiet, but happy.  He told me about the new case he was working on at the firm.  He was older than me, three years older.  He landed an internship at a law firm while he was still an undergrad.  He told me law school was hard but he accomplished it, just finished before we started dating.  I didn’t expect to be dating so soon after my breakup with*him*, but fate happens I guess.  I hated that word: fate.

Royce snored at night.  It was hard for me to fall asleep on a good night, let alone that night when my head was ablaze.  Every time I closed my eyes I saw *him*. Memories, like the pictures on his wall, danced across my eyelids.  My sister’s wedding, the picnic on the beach, our trip to Virginia, the vultures by the pond, and each one with its memory haunted my mind.

I knew from the day we met I wanted to be with him.  He just had a genuine smile and cared about what I said.  We had passion too, like those newlyweds who can’t keep their hands off each other.  He promised me we’d be those newlyweds one day.  

Royce stirred next to me.  I rolled over and burrowed into his chest, his beard scratching my forehead.  In a month I’d be in Kansas.  Far away from here.  Far away from *him*.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn’t help dreaming about her that night.  She was my best friend, my confidant, she knew everything about me, but she was a stranger.  All the memories that I had pushed away came flooding back.  I still loved her.  I always had, always would.  We met in high school, went to college together, lived together.  Six years erased in six months.

I knew about Royce.  I knew he had that job in Kansas that would give her stability and a big house.  She wouldn’t have to clean; she hated the dishes and the vacuum more than her hatred for mushrooms.  She could have babies and never have to worry about lifting a finger.  Royce was better for her, I guess.  No guy ever wants to admit that his girl may be better off somewhere else with someone else. But in the darkness of my room I couldn’t deny it.  I hated my job, hell, I told her I wanted to quit.  She told me I would hate it.  She was right.  Damn it. 

Sleep finally overtook me but my mind was occupied with her all night. Her voice, her hips, the tattoo on her back, all of it taunted me.  I jolted out of bed.  I swore I heard something.  The phone. My heart raced, I knew it had to be her.

“Hello?”

“Hey man,” my face dropped as the masculine voice answered.

“It’s three in the morning.”

“Can you come jump my car?  I’m over at O’Brian’s and I left the lights on.”

I got all worked up for nothing.  I shoved my feet into my flip-flops, brushed my teeth, and double checked for my jumper cables.  The ten-minute drive to O’Brian’s felt like an eternity.  I wondered what she was doing, was she asleep?  Out?  Making love to Royce?  I knew I would make myself sick but I couldn’t help the thoughts.

“Thanks so much, man.  I owe you big time.”

“Yeah, yeah.  Here by yourself?”

“You’ll never guess.  Shelby finally went out with me.  She’s inside. Obviously this was a damper but I think things will turn around.”

“Guess who stopped by.”

“No,” he stopped connecting the cables to his battery and turned around shocked.  “She didn’t.”

“She did.”

“I knew something was off.  What happened?”

“She just dropped off the rent check,” I didn’t feel like rehashing the evening.

“Doesn’t she usually just mail it?”

“She’s moving to Kansas.”

“She wanted the crack at the ol’ boy again,” he laughed.

“Not exactly, she’s with Royce, remember?  And she left my house mad and went home to him.  I’ll probably never see her again.  Good riddance.”

“Good riddance,” he agreed.

I wish I could say I woke up rested.  I didn’t.  It’s like she was still in my house.  I actually had thought I’d wake up and see her lying next to me.  She really messed me up.  She was waking up next to Royce, cooking breakfast for Royce, kissing Royce. God, I hated him.  I wanted to hate her, but I couldn’t find it in me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up alone.  Royce was an early riser.  That never used to happen when I was with him; we stayed in bed until the other had to get up. Why am I still thinking about him? It wasn’t until I decided to move to Kansas that he even entered my mind.  It was probably just my nervousness of moving away from my hometown. Or that’s what I told myself.  He belonged here.  I belonged somewhere new and exciting with Royce.  I just never thought that exciting place would have been Kansas.

I smelled coffee.  Royce made the best coffee.  I didn’t start drinking it until we started dating.  I realized it made grading papers easier.  Right out of college *he*helped me get a job as a teacher.  His mom worked in the same district, she still did.  Those interactions were always tense.  I knew he hated his job.  I couldn’t help the smile that spread across my face.  Smugness, he always yelled at me for that.  Man, did we yell.

“Do you want coffee, sleepyhead?” Royce stuck his head in.  “What’s wrong?”

“Nothing, come back to bed.”

“I have work to do.  Didn’t you want to go to that museum later?” I nodded.  “Then I have to get some work done now.” I looked up at him and stuck out my bottom lip a little.  “Pouting doesn’t work on me, come on,” he smiled and offered me his hand.

I sat at the table while I watched him pour the two cups of coffee.  One cream and Sweet N’ Low for me, black for him. He smiled triumphantly as he handed me the cup.  I breathed in the steam rising off the top of the coffee.

“Thank you, baby,” he pulled a chair up as I savored the taste of caffeine. It wasn’t until I sat the cup down that I saw the logo.  The simple company name *Pete’s Pools*shot me back close to seven years ago.

“Hey, we go to school together.”

I lifted my sunglasses to get a better look at the face that went with the voice, “well how about that, we do.”  I settled back into the deck chair with my book.

“Aren’t you going to say hi to me?”

I glanced upwards, “hello.”  I wasn’t interested in talking to the pool boy.  He snickered and went back to work on the filters.  It was he and another guy, Pete.  Pete had been the sole pool cleaner in our little town for years. Boys clamored to his shop every summer, hoping to clean the pool of some girls having a bikini party.  I wasn’t going to give this guy the satisfaction. I wrapped my towel around me and opened the sliding glass door.

“Ma’am,” this time it was Pete who addressed me.  I turned.  “Ma’am, I’m sorry for asking, but our cooler done ran out of ice.  Can we get two waters?  I’d greatly ‘preciate it.”

I ended up giving them two water bottles.  Pete said his thanks, when I handed the boy from my school his water his fingers brushed against mine.

“Thank you ma’am,” his voice was soft this time.  I had to crane my neck to look into his eyes, shielding my face with my hand.  

“Are you okay?” My heart jumped as Royce’s voice brought me back.

“Just daydreaming.”  I needed to get *him*out of my head.  I shouldn’t be thinking about the first time he spoke to me.  I shouldn’t be thinking about the way his words sounded smooth like velvet.  Why was I so stupid?  Why did I have to go see him?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I’d been seeing her around school since my freshman year when I moved here. I didn’t actually talk to her until the summer before our senior year when I cleaned her pool.  I cleaned it every two weeks all summer.  It was the highlight of my long days in the sun. I’d count down the days every night before I went to bed, smiling and playing out what our interactions might be like.  

I found out by December of my senior year that I was accepted to the University of Florida.  And what do you know, so was she.  At that point we were eating our lunches together in the school courtyard.  The day I told her I got accepted to U of F she kissed my cheek.  I asked her to dinner to celebrate our acceptances.  There was no formal declaration of “love” or whatever high school kids think they feel.  We just…were. By the start of the New Year we were inseparable.  Valentine’s Day, Spring Break, Prom, we were even runner up for prom queen and king. I actually cringed thinking back to how cliché it all would have been.  It was like a romantic-comedy movie.  She loved those; she loved to laugh at all the corny lines and gestures. 

And now we weren’t.  I laughed to myself, it’s funny how you can go from being something that exists almost to the cosmic level to absolute nothing—obliteration.  That’s truly how I felt.  Like the stars and the moon were obliterated and I was just the lonely planet spinning in the darkness without my light."
9kjr2k,1,2018-10-01,25 [M4F] - A Day At Nymphomaniac Corp,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9kjr2k/25_m4f_a_day_at_nymphomaniac_corp/,"Most days in most companies have a typical sequence of events. The employees get in at around 9, some stragglers reach around 10. They spend some time getting caught up with their work and coworkers before getting to work (seemingly) until lunch. The afternoon is more work but also some counting down to 5 PM so that the workers can go home and get ready to repeat that process the next day. But Nymph Corp isn’t a typical office. 

There is an unusual ratio of women to men in their main office. For every 2 men there are 8 women and it seems that the women are the ones who hold most leadership positions and any authority. The multi-floor building that is the main office is surrounded by one way windows to prevent anyone from looking inside and all the entrances have guards who are handsomely compensated for making sure no one out of place gets too close. 

Jane has been an assistant at Nymph Corp for about half a year now and she is just barely getting the hang of things. The culture of the company had left her shocked initially but given the compensation, job security, location and benefits package she had decided to accept it. Her day to day was very different from the average assistant’s day. 


It was currently 2 PM and she held a tray of coffees for her superiors that she HAD to get to them in the afternoon everyday. Wearing a simple long gray skirt, a red conservative sweater and simple heels she made her way through the halls of the building hurriedly. Jane was 22 years old and about 5’6” in height, caramel skinned, had a slim body with some curves that would turn heads if she wasn’t so bent on keeping them hidden. Her ass alone, like most Latina women around her age, was large and round despite her small waist. She tended to keep to herself, work hard and stay clear of any trouble.

She quickly walked to Miss Sarah’s office, she was an account executive for the company, and knocked on the door politely. “Mmmm come on in,” said a seductively voice from the other side with some moans. Jane braces herself and entered.

Miss Sarah was an attractive blonde Eastern European woman of medium height and curves that went very well with her figure. She was currently wearing just a black lace bra with her leather skirt, black pumps, shirt and thong lying to the side. Bent over her desk with her pressed against it, she moaned and gasped as David her intern plunged his cock deep in and out of her vagina. His hips slammed into her round tight white ass with each thrust making her moan and scream while he grunted and moaned a little himself.

“Mmmph leave ahhh the coffee ah ah you’re so good in my cunt ah on the desk Jane,” she said between moans, gripping the edge of her desk to steady herself. 

Jane quietly puts the coffee on the desk and tries to maintain her composure. This wasn’t anything new to her at this point but it still flustered her each time. 

She left the room and took a deep breath to gather herself before continuing on her coffee run. Jane knew this wouldn’t be the only such incident today. She walked on and reached the office of Mrs Stacey who usually left her door open. But Jane still decided to knock before walking in.

Mrs Stacey was currently lying on her desk with her head over one edge and her legs over the other with Joe and Frank on either side. She was of Spanish descent and her skin was a tanned shade that many women spend money to achieve. She was just about 5’2” in height and was of a petite frame with modest pointy breasts, a flat stomach, shapely legs and a small tight ass. But what she lacked in curves she made up for with an insatiable sex drive. Her clothes were still on though her shirt was unbuttoned to expose her bra and her pink skirt was hiked up as her legs hung in the air. She had her hands around Joe gripping his ass as he pushed his cock in her mouth while on the other end Frank continued to penetrate her vagina. She used one hand to tap near her on the desk on noticing Jane enter.

Jane quickly leaves the coffee on the desk where Mrs Stacey tapped and exits the room while trying to keep her wits about her.

*One of these days I’ll have a heart attack* she thinks to herself. *Oh well only one left. But this is the toughest one.*

She walks over to the CEO’s office. There is no name or sign hanging over the door but everyone knew that this was Miss Roxanne’s office. She was a very ambitious 31 year old woman who constantly kept striving for more success and kept her physical condition perfect, with a body that would put many girls younger than her to shame.

Jane knocks on the door politely as usual. “Come on in!” This time the voice had no sexual innuendo. *I guess she’s having a normal day today* Jane thinks to herself as she walks in. But she’s wrong completely.

Roxanne is dressed in a pair of sexy black boots that go past her knees and to her thighs, the light bouncing off them and drawing attention to her perfect stockings clad legs. A black garter belt is around her waist and she is wearing black crotch less panties. Her abs are visible on her flat perfect stomach and her round large breasts are held in place by a simple black bra. Her hair is tied in a ponytail and in her hand is a black stick.

“Ah Jane dear, you’re just in time,” Miss Roxanne says pointing at her desk with the stick. “Leave the coffee on my desk, I’ll have it once I’m done playing with these toys.”

She looks down at the three male employees on their knees in front of her who are naked with blindfolds on and their hands tied behind their backs. Roxanne rubs the tip of her stick against one of them and holds it against his cock.

“Now whose pet are you Eric?” she says teasingly. 

“I uh I’m your pet Miss Roxanne,” he blurts out as she strokes his cock with the stick.

“Good boy,” she says before bringing the stick up and pushing it against the cocks of the other guys and continuing with her dominating.

Jane quietly walks out and goes to the washroom to wash her face. She takes a deep breath to prepare for the interview at 4 with the new boy who will be joining. It’s unconfirmed who his interviewer will be but she needs to coordinate it...


———————————————————-

So that’s the prompt, I hope you enjoyed it! As you can see it’s about an office environment full of women who are very sexual and aren’t afraid to act on their urges. It may seem like the women are in “control” and that is true at times but some are submissive while some are dominant. 

I would love to hear what you think, this is open to go anywhere. You could play a specific woman in the office or multiple and we can figure out where it should go.

My kinks are rough sex, spanking, hair pulling, dominating, giving up control, flirting, dirty talk, cheating, interracial and more.

Limits are incest, scat, blood, gore and any crazy stuff.

We can discuss further details in PMs, I look forward to hearing from you!

Also I do prefer long term over short term and replies that are a bit well thought out. We can always hash the story together and take it wherever we want

9kjr6z,27,2018-10-01,[NA] September 24-30 Week Recap,Tomahawkeye12,boxoffice,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/9kjr6z/na_september_2430_week_recap/,"Happy Monday everyone! This is a continuation of my dailies posts that recap and analyze box office for Mondays-Thursdays. I’m tracking comps for 6 films right now, and I want to provide full-week recaps and analysis of weekend grosses. These will be posted on Mondays after weekend actuals come in, and in preparation for the regular series posts on Tuesday-Friday. **To be clear, these recaps are for Monday-Sunday gross, not for a Friday-Thursday box office week.** Additionally, to stay focused, these updates will look solely at the films I’ve been running comps on. There’s enough general discussion about weekend results without me throwing out random thoughts. Let’s get started. Today, I’ll provide full-week updates on *The House*, *The Predator*, *A Simple Favor*, *The Nun*, *Crazy Rich Asians*, and *Mission: Impossible – Fallout*. Tomorrow, I’ll roll out a few comps for *Night School* and *Smallfoot*.

- *The House* had some soft weekdays, which we expected due to a large portion of its target audience being in school. Due to this, Universal was probably hoping for a stronger weekend hold, but the film dropped by 53%. For the full week, it ran at 91% of *Goosebumps* and 82% of *Miss Peregrine*. The trajectory of these films gives us a final gross between **$76-80m**, enough to call the movie a success due to the moderate $42m budget.

- *The Predator* lost over 1,000 screens on Friday and fell to #8 on the weekend... below *Crazy Rich Asians*. That’s hilarious. For the full week, it ran at 105% of *Predators*, 69% of *Alien: Covenant*, and 50% of *Kingsman 2*. Expect **$52-54m** as a final.

- *A Simple Favor* continued to impress last week, with a total of $10.6m (only 35% lower than the $16.4m of the previous week). For the full week, it ran at 81% of *The Intern*, 127% of *I Feel Pretty*, and 172% of *Acrimony* (a comp I’m going to drop). I find this movie very difficult to predict, but I think **$60-65m** is a decent projection right now.

- *The Nun* had a mix of great and terrible days last week, and the 46% weekend hold is a strong result. For the full week, it ran at 66% of *The Conjuring*, 100% of *Conjuring 2*, 155% of *Annabelle*, and 77% of *Annabelle: Creation*. Let’s talk about our *Conjuring 2* comp a bit: the last 3 weeks, *The Nun* has run at 102%, 98%, and 100% of *Conjuring 2*, respectively. As a Fall film, *The Nun* is suffering in the weekday comps against the Summer release of *Conjuring 2*, and making up for it with strong weekend comps. Here’s the comp for each day of Monday-Sunday last week: 63%, 71%, 57%, 73%, 130%, 175%, 114%. Really satisfying window into how strong weekends make up for soft weekdays. Anyway, **$117-119m** seems realistic right now.

- *Crazy Rich Asians* has is slipping a bit in our comp against *The Help*, even with yet another strong weekend hold. For the full week, it ran at 91% of *The Help*. Still a very impressive week though, and our projected total is **$179-180m**.

- *Mission: Impossible – Fallout* is sprinting toward **$220m**, because that’s the only way Tom Cruise knows how to move. It’s taking advantage of relatively strong theater count holds. For the full week, it ran at 161% (!!!) of *Rogue Nation*, with a stronger than expected Sunday of $159k that was nearly double *Rogue Nation*. The strong gross on Friday officially brought us back to a projected total of $220m based on *Rogue Nation’s* trajectory. This is the first time we’ve seen this projection since Day 49 of its run (Friday was day 64).

Please let me know what you think about this! If people enjoy it as a continuation of the dailies posts, I’ll keep it up. This gives me a good chance to develop a consolidated narrative of the box office for these films, rather than comments each individual day. It also lets me comment on weekend results early, rather than waiting until Tuesday to chat again.

**Additionally, the mods have started stickying some of these, which I appreciate. I think that’s a good way to get more discussion going. I’m hoping this continues, because the posts in the last week that haven’t been stickied, or that have only been stickied late after many hours, have seen very little discussion. Thanks as always for engaging!**

9kk2an,5,2018-10-01,State school or hopkins premed,regretsyndrome,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/9kk2an/state_school_or_hopkins_premed/," 

Hi! I'd appreciate any thoughts at all, as I'm currently completely lost.

I declared my major as Compsci as an incoming freshman, but I'm planning to change my major and go premed. The thing is, the cost of attending this institution is hefty, much more than if I were to go to an in-state school. Obviously, the best financial option would be for me to transfer to a college close to home, but I would also like to consider the importance of institution and prestige for med school acceptances. Do you think a 3.8+ GPA at a public university (ranked around 130) would carry the same weight as a 3.5 at Hopkins?

In terms of performance, I also believe I could manage a much higher GPA at the state school than Hopkins. Of course, there may be less resources, but I believe I could be more successful at home with a strong support system (friends and family) and more time outside of studying to intern, volunteer, etc. However, Hopkins obviously offers better pre-health advising and world-renown opportunities although it is also much more competitive, what with a student body populated with intelligent and ambitious individuals. I am currently under the impression that if I go back home, I'll have a better chance to stand out and maintain a solid GPA, but I'm reluctant to give up because of Hopkins' opportunities and prestige.

Thank you to everyone who read all the way through, and I'd be super grateful if anyone offered up their opinion!"

9kkena,2,2018-10-01,Residential vs Commercial Insight and Help,saucykush,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/9kkena/residential_vs_commercial_insight_and_help/,"Guys and gals,

I recently just started a job with a General Contractor (Company A). I’m fresh out of college since May. I’ve had 5 internships (in the field) in commercial construction with a different company (Company B).
Gotta be honest I’m not having fun. At least with Company B I was doing sports complexes so it was something worth while. The new company that I’m at is just a culture shock. And it doesn’t seem like anyone here is happy except for a few people. My two bosses that sit next to me even say that they would choose a different career path if they could. That doesn’t make me feel too good about where I am! My superintendent seems miserable and I thought I wanted to go down the superintendent path but not anymore! 

I didn’t sign up to work past 5:00 every night (getting here at 7:00). And when I do work late I get no reimbursement for it (if I try to butt out 30 minutes early the next day I get guilt tripped). Shit hits the fan if I’m gone for more than 30 minutes for lunch like that’s a sin or something. Or even if I’m in the bathroom for more than 5 minutes... ??? It’s just little petty things like that. Who knows maybe I’m not cut out for this type of industry but one thing I know is that I regret not taking the offer with Company B and going with Company A. And it eats at me every day but it is what it is for now. So I’ve been thinking about switching to residential. I just don’t want to jump ship here and then say “damn I wish I was doing commercial projects.”

I like the idea of custom homes. It seems more condensed and maybe a little more organized but also it just seems like something I would enjoy more. I wanted to get some insight on a few things that differ from residential to commercial. 

Can you guys give me any tips or advice on making that transition and any other pointers? (Or tips to make this experience less of a drag) 
I really want to know the difference between hours, pay, responsibilities. I don’t know. I feel like I’m screwed. The money is nice but what’s the point if you aren’t enjoying what you do. And I’m stuck here for a year until we finish this project then I’m getting out of dodge. "

Whether you want to be a dominant bitch sat on my face until I'm desperate for air, or an obedient little sub begging me to fuck you up the ass until you break. If it's focused on your butt, I'm in the mood to play it.

Excluding scat, this includes whatever kinks you want to play. Want me to surprise you by pressing my face to your ass and taking a deep sniff? I'm there. Want me to lick the sweat from your asshole after a workout? I'll make it shine. want to smother a younger guy with your mature booty? I don't need air. Want to be the fuckdoll for an older man? You won't sit down for a week. And so on, so forth.

Personally my favourite way to start is with you as a bratty younger girl (probably early 20s) who I simply can't resist. Maybe you're my bosses daughter doing an internship in my department, or the neighbour girl flaunting your body by the pool, even my own daughter who I have to punish for whatever reason. Though I'm totally open to anything, just me know the age you're interested in, and whether you want to play dom or sub.

I'm more than happy with celebrity plots too if you have a famous ass you want to have played with, or I can offer plenty of references for non-celeb girls if you don't have a character in mind. As always, priority given to people willing to change their name and/or picture if we go with that, but not at all required.

Ordering samples, updating Marriott design guidelines, working on AutoCAD for vanity elevations and plans, Renderings with Photoshop.

**Are there any specific tasks, other than what you have already done, that you like to be involved with during your internship?**

I think I’m pretty much feeling good about what I’ve been doing so far. I’m personally more interested in working on renderings and FF&amp;E because I can be exposed about how designers select materials and finishes for creating a space.
Within that, I think I want to be involved in construction documents so that I could learn how designers create a floor plan, furniture plan, and ceiling plan. 

**Has your view of the Hospitality Design Industry changed? If so in what way?**

My view of the Hospitality design industry has been changed in more good way since I’ve been interning here. Hospitality design is what I’ve always interested in when I started interior design. Designing hotel lobby, guestroom, meeting etc are very exciting to design and I see hotels as an international gathering space where visitors and travelers can feel welcome and have a good experience within the space.  As I’m interning here now, I feel more excited to work in the hospitality industry in the future.


**Are there any areas of weakness/things that you can improve on for the remainder of your internship?**

I think my weakness is that I’m not really sure about the whole design process of a real project in the office.  Since I’m just working on what I was given to work for my team members, I started question myself how they start creating plans and elevations and if the designers are in charge of drawing all of the construction documents and how they come up with concept and design ideas, and how they communicate with their project with client. 

Since I’m in school, and only design for a hypothetical client, I wanted to improve my understanding of the design process with the real projects and how designers meet the certain budge with great design. 

**Do you have any strengths that you feel are being underutilized by DCI?**
I don’t think so because I am working on what I can do well in the office and happy about what I’m learning so far!



**Do you feel like you have enough interaction and communication with the intern Supervisors and other designers at the firm?**

This is one of my goals that I really want to work on it. I think I need to try to interact more with everyone. I mostly interact with few team members that I work for, but I sometimes wish I could do a small talk with others. 

**Is there anything about the internship that you wish was different? Provide general feedback for if you are enjoying your experience so far and if you feel like you are growing as a designer.**

Since I ever interned here, everyone here motivates me somehow with their projects and professionalism, and talents.  I am definitely growing as a designer and this work environment makes me feel good about working and about coming to work and gives me a positive thought of being an interior designer. Thank you for giving me this intern opportunity again!

**Prologue - The Reckoning**

The ground trembled.

She stirred in her slumber.

She opened her eyes, but her vision is clouded, and she can barely see.

*Is it time?*

She could not tell. It always seemed so close, only to be disappointed yet again.

She sighed. It felt like lifetimes ago. Fighting up the ranks to prove herself as a formidable female warrior, sword and shield in hand, glistening both in the pale moonlight and the blood of her foes, baptizing herself in the tears of the fallen as her long, golden hair flows in the winds of victory.

Yes, her beautiful golden hair. Right before Loki snipped it off and replaced it with one dark as stallion, black as night.

She snorted with disgust. How could a man as magnificent as Thor have such a vile creature as his kin? She made a mental note to make sure Loki gets a piece of her mind when she sees him again. *If* she sees him again.

The ground trembled yet again. She felt something poke her.

*This is no way a God should be treated! I shall have words with the Allfather-*

It was swiftly cut off when she felt her mind waking up. Energy levels are rising, and she could feel it.

*Could it be….?*

Her vision starts to focus, and power surged through her body, like a bolt of lightning through the boundless skies of the Nine Realms. She could almost hear the crack of thunder, but in a split second, it was gone. Yet, she knew. Even for a fleeting moment, she knew.

She smiled, something she has not done in a thousand years.

*It is time.*

**2:01 pm 20 January, 1958 - Strange and Blake’s Medical Practices, Hospital, NYC**

""Still having your head deep in small cases, I see.""

Donald Blake looked up from his chart, unamused. ""I mean, someone has to save all these lives. Every life is- ""

""-worth saving. I know. But shouldn't we leave these small cases to the interns and graduates while we go for the big fish?”

Blake finally puts down his chart and looks up at his old friend. ""What do you want, Stephen?""

Stephen Strange hands Blake a medical docket. “I come bearing gifts, my friend.”

Strange and Blake were college roommates back at Harvard Medical School. Since graduating, they’ve been working at New York Medical Centre with Blake being more of a general practitioner and Strange rising up the ranks and becoming the super-star neurosurgeon he is now.

“Charles McNider. 30-year old surgeon, got blasted by shrapnel from a hand grenade in close quarters few months ago. Poor guy lost his sight. Theoretically speaking, the shrapnel should have penetrated his cornea, destroying his optic nerves and disconnecting the brain, costing him his sight. But to deal that much damage to the eye to cause this-”

Strange turns to Blake, looking him dead in the eye.

“-he shouldn’t be alive.” Blake finished, his eyes skimming across the patient file. ""Fascinating stuff."" He rubbed his chin, taking in every minute detail of the case.

“That’s not even the fun part. Turns out he’s blind only during the day, claims to regain 100% of his vision once it’s dark.”

“Interesting. Heightened vision in the dark, kinda reminds me of the pupillary response of an owl.”

“Exactly like an owl.” Strange strutted over to the window overseeing the magnificent city of New York, taking in the hustling and bustling of city life. “Blake, taking on this case will put us on the map. We could work for S.T.A.R. Labs, get funding from Wayne Biotech for our researches. Imagine the possibilities. We would be the Elvises of the Medical World; I’ll get all the ladies and you,” Strange gave Blake a cheeky wink, “can finally get that color-TV for Jane.”

Blake got up shakily, leaning on his walking stick to put on his doctor’s coat. “And I’m guessing you’re too busy to see him yourself, Mr Doctor-Of-The-Year?”

“Like you said, all I do is meddle with brains all day”. Strange gave his buddy a pat on the back. “You know, there’s more to life itself than saving lives. Wine, women, and… ” Strange trailed off dreamily.

“And wasting precious and very limited hospital resources on experimental nerve cell regeneration research?”

Strange smirked as he buttoned up his tailored suit. “Someone’s gotta pay the bills in this place. Don’t you think you’re selling yourself short here? We’re Harvard graduates, for crying out loud! We’re destined to change the world.”

*Typical Stephen and his big dreams.*

Strange saunters over, his Louis Vuittons making resounding clicks on the floor, shiny alligator leather and all. “Come on, work with me on this one. It’d be like the old days in college when we worked on that paper on Neuroscience together. It’ll be fun.” He checked out his cellphone before turning and hurrying towards the door. “I'll meet you there after I am done with the operation on the mayor's daughter.”

As Strange’s footsteps echoed down the hallways, Blake looked back at the docket once more.

He picked up the phone and dialed.

“Nurse Joy? Is there someone who can cover my shift? I am going to have to cancel the rest of the appointments for the day. Something’s come up.”

&amp;#x200B;

**3:48 pm 20 January, 1958 - Blake’s car**

(*phone call to Jane Foster)*

“Hey babe, something came up at work.”

“Let me guess. A spacecraft from outer space landed in New York and somehow an alien takes the form of a human, and wants to know how he’s shooting lasers out of his eyes?”

“Something like that.”

“Donald, I thought we said we were having dinner with your mom tonight? If you jet off halfway during the day, how will you be back in time?”

“Look, I’m sorry, Jane. You knew I made a promise to myself to do all that I can for these people. If there is a life I can save, I’m taking it. I know it’s tough, and I won’t say I understand, but I promise you, I will make it back in time. I will even be bringing a little something for you.”

“If you aren't back in time, you can bet your ass I’m remembering this. If not for my shift in 20 minutes, I would so strangle you.”

“You can strangle me when I am back. In front of my mom.”

“I hate you.”

“I know.”

&amp;#x200B;

**4:14 pm 20 January, 1958 - McNider’s apartment, NYC**

“You can see at night.”

Blake looks over at Charles McNider. The man sat across from him in the hall, a pair of shades sitting on the bridge of his nose. Strange was late, as per usual.

*Is it customary for all blind men to wear shades?*

“My gut tells me that is a question, Dr Blake?”

Blake rummaged in his briefcase for the docket. “My partner should be arriving shortly, but help me understand this. Multiple lacerations of the iris and cornea, puncturing of the retina and the optic nerves caused by the shrapnel. You know it as well as I do, you should not be able to see at all.”

“What can I say, I’m a lucky bastard.” Charles stretched out his hand. An owl, large and spotted, swooped down and perched on his outstretched hand.

Blake almost fell off his seat. *Where did that come from?*

“You know, I was a man of science before, just like you.” Charles continued. “I was a brilliant doctor, scientist too, working everyday to better the lives of people. When my daughter contracted a rare genetic disease never seen before, no doctor would take her case for fear of negative publicity. Desperate, I devoted all my time into engineering a genetic drug to save her.”

Charles took off his shades, his fingers lightly massaging the bridge of his nose. Blake could see that this man’s eyes had lost its light, like the heart of a dying star.

“There was no bomb, Dr Blake. My experiments failed, and my lab exploded. All the physicians, including myself, believed that it was over, that I will never see again. But by some will of God, I have perfect vision in the dark. Miracles do exist after all.”

Blake listened and felt sorry for McNider. He remembered Strange’s heavy investments in stem cell regeneration and decided to give it a go. “I’m sorry to hear that, sir. I hope you’re coping with it well. But if what you told me is true, some parts of the iris may be severely damaged, restricting their light receptivity to daylight.” Blake’s voice quivered with anticipation. “If you don't mind, Dr McNider, I could take your case further and my colleagues at the hospital could perform an experimental cell regeneration to help restore some of the damaged tissues. We can get you back to normal again.”

McNider’s face hardened. “The only problem here is, I do mind. The press, the media, the experimental nature of the procedures. I may be blind, but don’t take me for a fool. Do you think I’m gonna let you experiment on me like a lab rat? You’re here for the publicity, for the recognition, just like all the others.”

The owl turned his head towards Blake, black unblinking eyes locking onto his. He shifted uneasily in his seat.

*Did he just… question my professionalism?*

Blake clenched his teeth but held himself back. ""I assure you, Mr McNider, I care about the well-being of all my patients, and I would only take it up if I believe 100% that it could work. I genuinely want to help, Charles.”

“Like hell you are.” Charles was silent for a moment. When he spoke, his voice was laced with emotion. “If you really mean what you say, you’d make sure to continue helping others. I can no longer operate, but you,” Charles looked in Blake’s general direction, his eyes staring into the the vast emptiness, almost as if looking for hope. “You still can. There are a million others out there who need help, but not many who care enough to try.”

Blake nodded, lowering his gaze. *He’s right.*

Blake reached into his shirt, pulling out a pocket watch. He traced the outline of it, his fingers moving over the polished, brass face embossed with the words:

    In this world, he who waits won’t get anything he wants.

It was a gift from his father, on his twelfth birthday.

In that moment, he was transported back to when he was a child.

\~

His twelfth birthday dinner was simple but sumptuous. Despite not being well to do, Blake’s mother always seemed to make the best meals. Blake could almost taste the baked sweet potato that his mother always made. He never could replicate the texture, even in his adult years.

His father brought him out onto the front lawn.

“Close yer eyes…” his father said.

Blake did as he was told, holding out his hands with anticipation. “Don’t open yer eyes till you can tell me what it is?”

Then, something was placed in his hand.

It was smooth. And roundish. Yet, it feels kind of familiar.

“A ball?” Blake heard a chuckle.

“Nope, try again.”

Blake pressed it and he felt something trickle down his fingers.

Blake opened his eyes. A slightly squashed tomato sat in his hands. He looked up at this father, confused.

“Happy Birthday, son! Do you like it?”

Blake arched an eyebrow. “Ermmm… its a tomato.”

“You don’t like it? Why don’t you work for a better present?” He hands Blake a piece of paper that was folded in half. Written on it were the words “Treasure Map”.

Blake takes the map and breaks into a grin, immediately beginning his quest to find his birthday present. It took some digging in the backyard but he finally found it.

A box with a nice ribbon on it. In it was a pocket watch, the very same one that Blake had in this moment, sitting before McNider. That pocket watch kept him company all through his life, from spending late nights at the library at Middle School, all the way to receiving his degree at Harvard Medical School.

\~

*Dad would be proud of me.*

Not forgetting his roots from the less fortunate, Blake decided to give back and dedicate his life towards aiding the people. And that is why he spearheaded a division specialised in taking on these unusual and often overlooked cases, often for free. It was never about the money.

A knock on the door broke his train of thought. The owl fluttered away.

Charles raised his eyebrows. Blake checked his pocket watch. *10 minutes to 5.*

“I should get going.” Blake picked up his walking stick, and hauled himself up. “Thank you for your time, Dr McNider. I appreciate it.” The gentlemen shook hands, and Blake headed for the door.

McNider’s visitor is a woman with dark black hair.

Blake nodded as he passed the woman. She was beautiful. He caught a glimpse of her oval face, her pale flawless skin, and those scorching green eyes. Eyes of pain, of hurt and loss. Eyes of battle; of smoke, fire and destruction. Eyes that seem hauntingly familiar to Blake.

She seemed to have the same confusion written all over her face.

Blake blinked, shaking it off. He didn’t mean to stare, that was rude. He hurriedly bid his farewells, and went on his way.

*Well, that was awkward. That is no way to treat a fine lady.*

Blake hobbled out of the house with his cane. He looked up at the building.

Shame, he could really take a further look at McNider. Unlike Strange, he truly wanted to help all those around him, regardless of the fame or fortune that he was accused of trying to chase.

Deep in thought, the sound of broken glass and screams jolted him back into reality. He turned in shock, and caught a glimpse of a man wielding a crowbar, going through a window he just broke. He is wearing a dirty green jumpsuit, like the ones belonging to the city’s demolitions crew, with a mask over his face. That’s when Blake realised a bank robbery is happening just a few feet away from him.

*Speaking of money grabbing pricks…*

Blake hobbled behind a car, and took cover behind it while he assessed the situation. He pulled out his cellphone and called the cops.

“I don’t wanna hurt nobody, ‘ol Wrecker’s here for the bank's money.” The man who called himself the Wrecker hauled himself on top of the front counter. “Think of yer families, don't risk yer life. Don't try and be a hero.”

He fished out a black case, and gestured for it to be filled up. No one moved.

The Wrecker grabbed the nearest man, and swung his crowbar across his face.The man slammed into the wall before slumping to the ground. A security guard pulled out a gun, but before he could react, the Wrecker sent him flying out of the bank with a swift kick to the chest.

The Wrecker turned, with a maniacal smile plastered across his face. “Just kiddin’ yall, I love violence.” He cracked his neck, his mighty crowbar slinging across his broad shoulders. “Oh, I bin itchin’ fer this.”

The bank attendants set to work filling up the case with money without another word.

Blake clenched his fists in anger as he watched. The security guard had landed in the middle of the road, beside the car he was crouching behind. He struggled to get up, clutching his chest in pain.

Blake was terrified out of his wits, but his body reacted faster. He crawled over and pulled himself as close to the security guard as possible without alerting the assailant. He checked his pulse, and assessed the man. *Tension pneumothorax, probably caused by multiple rib fractures. If the venous bleeding continues, he could bleed out and die.* “You’re gonna be fine,” Blake’s medical experience and instincts kicked in as he reassured the man. “Just concentrate on your breathing. Try not to move too much.” With the amount of pain he must be experiencing, Blake was surprised the man is still conscious.

“You there! Whatcha think yer doin’?”

*Oh, shit.*

Blake took a deep breath as he turned to see the Wrecker staring straight at him. “Oh lookie, a cripple. You ain’t thinkin’ ‘bout callin’ the cops on the Wrecker, are ‘ya? I’m gonna teach you a lesson you won’t forget.”

Instinctively, Blake put himself between the Wrecker and the security guard. This man was his patient and he’ll be damned before the Wrecker lays another finger on this poor man.

Blake stared defiantly at the Wrecker as he sauntered over. All signs of fear from before magically vanished. Blake stood up on his cane and looked straight into the Wrecker’s eyes. He raised his cane to strike the Wrecker but he simply laughed and swatted it away. Blake lost his balance and fell back down, next to the security guard.

The Wrecker flashed a devilish grin. “How about I make it even for ‘ya?”

Blake closed his eyes as the Wrecker raised the crowbar. Blake’s final thought was of Jane and how her cute face would be scrunched up in anger when she finds out he’s probably not going to be at the dinner after all.

That was when it happened. From the corner of his eye, Blake saw a beam from the heavens. A pillar of light, shimmering in colours of the rainbow, engulfing him in different hues of silver and gold. As it hit the ground, a figure dropped from the skies, landing between Blake and the Wrecker.

*What the hell…*

The figure crouched and held up a shield. There was a deafening twang as the crowbar and shield collide, sending out a shockwave so strong it knocked Blake a few feet backwards from where he was. He felt the back of his head collide with the car he was hiding behind.

The figure turned, and Blake realised it was the dark haired lady from before. She looked different, in some sort of shiny silver armour. Her green eyes glowed like emeralds as she looked straight at Blake and extended her hand towards him.

“I’ve finally found you… Thor.”

That was the last thing Blake remembered before his world slipped into darkness."
9kohbo,1,2018-10-02,Logging Items moved into Guild Bank,derfloh205,wowaddons,https://www.reddit.com/r/wowaddons/comments/9kohbo/logging_items_moved_into_guild_bank/,"Hello, I am trying to find a way of logging item disposals into the guildbank myself.
Like identify the item that was moved into the bank and saving in into a map like [[Player: TestName, ItemID: blabla, ItemAmount: 5], [...], [...]].

The problem now is that the game intern bank log is annoying to use. It is an async load on demand ... so everytime I'd like to view the contents I need to call the load function and catch it with the log_loaded event.

So I thought it would be better to kinda log the item myself,
however the only events that could be useful and that I found with google were smth like ""guildbank_log_change"" (only fires when log was reloaded), ""guild_bank_changed""(fires when items in the bank were changed, could be you but also could be a change by anyone in your guild.. so a simple before after comparision is meaningless), and one that recognizes item movement within your bags, fired once by source and destination bag"". However without information what is source and what destination and I am not sure if it is fired by the guild bank if you move an Item into it.

Does anyone have any Idea how a self made log could be possible?"

9kp87z,14,2018-10-02,Take care of your current clients or onboard at a breakneck pace?,N7Valiant,msp,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/9kp87z/take_care_of_your_current_clients_or_onboard_at_a/,"Curious what your thoughts are.  I've evaluated our situation as one where we're neglecting our current clients (failed, failing servers, failed backups, dropping regular maintenance tasks), yet we're apparently chasing down at least another 10 potential clients even as our recently onboarded clients are getting the proverbial boot to the teeth (setting up backups, then never checking so you could see that they failed since Day 1 for months, never bothering to get their stuff patched, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

I typically average about 50-60 hours of work in a given week, so I sincerely doubt this is due to time management on my part.  It's also a bit upsetting when your employer lets slip that they have no plans to hire more techs and will in fact do things that get in our way(like having us babysit interns for brownie points).  I've been trying to take as many steps as I can to automate and refine processes to save time, but it seems like whenever I find a way to save a few hours, upper management finds a way to waste several days of time for every hour I shave off.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there is certainly some benefits in that you might be less obligated to cater to bad clients.  I just don't feel like we're in a good spot given that an utter lack of enforcing standards (still supporting 10+ year old machines, Windows Server 2003, Windows Home, etc.) means we still have too much break/fix to cope with the workload.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you had to prioritize the two, which would you go for?  My philosophy is that you should learn to do things right before you worry about doing things fast.  If your processes, your procedures, your standards are down pat and everyone does things efficiently, then that can be replicated to new clients.

&amp;#x200B;

If however you're doing things wrong, you're still doing things wrong, and you still haven't actually finished onboarding clients from several months ago before jumping off to onboard other clients, well that just seems sloppy."

9kpltt,6,2018-10-02,My partner is questioning (possible tw),anyeducation,mypartneristrans,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/9kpltt/my_partner_is_questioning_possible_tw/,"Hi everybody, I’ve been a Reddit-reader for a while now but I’m new to posting, so please bear with me.

Recently, I \[20f\] found out that my partner \[21, assigned m at birth\] is questioning his gender. We’ve been together for four years and I’ve known about this for over a year now. I know that he’s had problems with his gender before. I think that his dysphoria is getting worse, however. The last time we spoke about this was summer 2017, and after four days apart while I was out of town and we had minimal contact, he promised me that he was feeling better and that he was happy as a man. That was the last I heard about this.

This past week while I was spending time with him, I noticed that he had shaved his legs and his pubic area (told me he did it over two weeks ago) and painted his nails with clear polish. He also described how he’s been having a ridiculously tough semester. I put two and two together and asked him if he was questioning his gender again, and he said yes. I immediately broke down into tears. This is the first time he’s ever “acted upon” his dysphoria, so I’m sure that this is more serious. 

The way he pitched it to me when we discussed this was that he was still going through a lot of questioning. He said sometimes he’s happy as a man, sometimes he wishes to be a woman. It sounds to me like he has dysphoria whenever he goes through a great amount of stress. He also said that he does not feel dysphoric whenever he's around me or friends. We spent the rest of the weekend talking about it, both of us crying (mostly me) and he told me that he would “think about this” and decide that he would let me know what he determines. We agreed that we would give each other space to process this and figure everything out, however that’s been easier said than done. I was messaging him one day ago and I suggested that maybe he’s genderfluid or non-binary and he said he hadn’t thought of that, but that he will because consider it it sounds like it may be the right identity for him. I am unsure if that is how he really feels or if he was just saying that to make me feel better. I also found his reddit page (we haven’t shared these with each other) and I found a post from seven days ago where he talked about being trans but not out yet. He contacted therapy services at his school and has an appointment but not until later this month because of how busy they are. He also made me promise that whatever he ultimately decides to feel, I MUST trust that that is the decision he wants to make. 

I have been struggling with this A LOT. Since he left (we’re long distance since we go to different universities), I’ve been dealing with a lot. I cry nonstop, even getting sent home early from my internship yesterday morning because my mentor walked in on me crying. I feel like I’m walking around in a mental fog, unable to focus on schoolwork. I’m unable to eat.  I’ve been feeling extremely nauseous from the anxiety and as a result I’ve been throwing up a lot. I have sleep problems; either I can’t fall asleep, or I wake up multiple times in the middle of the night, but I’m still physically and emotionally exhausted. I also went to a therapy consultation at my own school to discuss my own depression as well as this situation, and I should be hearing back from them soon. Finding his reddit page absolutely broke me more than it should have and made my anxiety and my panic much worse. I’m also considering going to an actual doctor this weekend to try and help sort this out. I've also talked to some of my friends about this (he requested that I do so) and nobody really has any idea what to say, all citing that I should ""do what is best for me."" He is the only person I have ever loved, and we share so much together. He makes me the happiest I have ever been, I have dreamed so long about being his wife and taking his last name and being with him forever, so naturally, you can imagine why this is very difficult for me. I legitimately feel like my entire life has fallen apart in the past 4 days.

This has been a hard blow. I am not sure if I can stay with him romantically if he transitions, since I am heterosexual and not attracted to women. I feel like no decision that I make is a good decision. I am (selfishly, I know) hoping and praying that this all goes away and that we can go back to normal, but I don’t want to be fearful that this will happen again especially since this isn’t the first time he’s discussed dysphoria with me. I also feel like if he decides that he is genderfluid/non-binary that he will eventually decide that being a woman is more fitting for him and I will be in the same situation. But I still want to be there for him as he transitions, because I understand how hard this must be for him, especially when he feels like he can’t come out to the majority of his family, friends, fraternity, colleagues/classmates. 

Please help. Any guidance is appreciated. 

Thank you all. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend of four years has had gender dysphoria for a while, we’ve discussed it more than once, finally he acted upon it by shaving legs/pubic area and wearing clear nail polish and not telling me until I saw him in person two weeks later. Still questioning his identity, one day ago I pitched the idea of genderfluidity and he said might be and that he will think about it, but a post from seven days ago that I found still says he thinks he’s MTF trans. I have been physically and emotionally suffering horribly from this. I don’t know if I want to stay with him but I can’t bear to leave him. "

I'll be turning 24 one month from now, and one year ago graduated with a 4 year degree in Computer Science. Despite an internship that I thought went well and thinking I was in a good place, I've struggled to find a job post graduation. 

One thing I've been doing in the meantime is helping my dad with the family boat. My family has a commercial fishing boat that my dad inherited when my grandfather died. One day I was helping wire two new bilge pumps to a switch in the main cabin and the thought of a potential career switch came to mind. I enjoy hands-on work and electrician work has always been interesting to me. 

So my main questions are these:

* Is such a switch common? More specifically would I be looked down upon because I already have a degree in something else? 
* From what I gather looking for information online the main routes for getting into the Electrical field are Apprenticeship Programs and studying at a trade school. Is either a particularly better choice? 
   * With an apprenticeship I can ""Earn as I learn"" but I'm unsure if this is usually more for people straight out of high school

Also I should say I live in southern California since location seems to be quite relevant. 

I'm still looking for a job in software development, but if I could successfully transition I definitely believe it would be something I'd enjoy and I have had concerns with things like Carpal Tunnel syndrome sitting at a computer all day. I see no reason to not consider it.

Just like the title says, Iv’e been skating by at my university and Iv’e come to a point where I can’t bullshit/cheat my way through.

I go to a mid level university in my home state (for monetary reasons). I come from a pretty bad part of MD and growing up my family never had money, our lights/water/heat/ac/gas would routinely be shut off due to non payment. 

Graduating high school was great, but finding out about fasfa was a dream come true. 

You’re telling me the governments gonna pay for my education if I’m poor? Fuck yeah sign me up. 

Looking back now, knowing what I know about subsidized/unsubsidized loans, I would have made a different choice, but can’t change the past.

So fasfa was great, I got the money for tuition, hurrah.

But fasfa only covered tuition, I’d have to pay for a place to live and food on my own. Like I mentioned before, my family didn’t have alot of money. Moms works in the military and supports both my older brothers including me, dads in jail, can’t remember the last time Iv’e seen him. 

So whats a kid to do? I got jobs. Iv’e always been good at finding a job. Chic filet, bath and body works, subway, uber, anything I got that would give me the extra money to live and eat while at school. (I still struggled horrendously though, I recall one week where I literally only had stale brown rice lmaooo....good times)

If not for friends (and girlfriends along the way) I more than likely wouldn’t have made it.

So I did what I had to do in order to survive at school, the problem was that I had zero leftover funds for books, those things are a Fucking scam, and don’t get me started on access codes.

Since I couldn’t afford to buy the materials I would ofter resort to other methods by which I could obtain the information. Befriending classmates, grabbing free pdfs from the interwebz, whatever I could do. But even doing all those things, there were many classes where I couldn’t get that material from alternative sources (like access codes fsss). So in classes like those I would resort to cheating (worst offense is math courses).

So Iv’e been chugging along like that for four years now, I decided to major in IT because I like computers, but a big factor in me choosing this major was the fact that the course material mainly came straight from the professor, rarely did we need to buy any books. Over the summer I saved up enough to buy a rinky laptop (that Iv’e run completely into the ground but I still use it cause its all Iv’e got)

Its my last semester and the only thing standing between me and my degree is a calculus class that Iv’e been putting off because I know I can’t cheat and the professor here only grades on tests. 3 each semester and your final grade is based off that. 

Iv’e passed all of my IT courses, plus capstone, I was even able to weasel my way into a couple internships and just had an interview with google yesterday (i don’t feel like I got the position, which is probably what spurred me to write this post) But I feel like I’m an imposter and this class is gonna expose me for the pseudo-educated individual I am. I’m truly scared that I can’t pass this class and I will never get my degree. I’m going to tutoring everyday now, we just began learning about derivatives. 

Fuck

I had to get this off my chest. I feel like I’m letting my mom down. Sorry for the depressing story reddit

I suffer from arthiritis since birth. It has gotten worse over the years to the point that i m wheelchair bound and my body stiffness has limited my mobility. I just recently passed my fourth (and last) semester in my University (dadabhoy institution of higher education) in BsCS. Also a student of Aptech, which is still ongoing. 

My father recently talked to me about my future and when will I start working.. which has scared me...to say the least.. because I absolutely have no idea on where should I look as I have no real world experience to say. I was always as a kid kept at home other than going to school (of course) so my interaction with the real world has always been fairly limited, and mostly through the internet.

I have no real friends to guide me so I don't know where I can ask for advice. I m fairly competent when it comes to computers and love PC building and helping other people in PC related stuff. I was always fascinated by PC hardware  and own a custom gaming rig which I built myself. 

Anyway, coming to the point. I m lost and not sure what to do next? Where should I look for internships and gather experience? I like game development too and thinking of learning unreal engine 4 and make something in it (maybe a doom clone?) To pass the time since I'm mostly free these days. 

Comments will be appreciated. Thanks all."

#2  You must believe that anyone who would lie about their fear of flying is not a liar.

#3  You must believe that two young teenage girls attending a gathering with 4 boys they did not know very well where alcohol is being consumed in a house where the owners and anyone who supposedly lives there is apparently not present is not considered unusual.

#4  you must believe that shortly after arriving one of those two teen age girls who reportedly were and still are best friends needed to use the restroom, and proceeded to do so alone, without the accompaniment of her best friend.

#5  You must believe that this residence in an upper income neighborhood had no ground level restroom thereby requiring a trip upstairs to use such facilities.

#6  You must believe that two reportedly 'slobbering' drunk teen age boys some how snuck up on this reportedly sober Teen girl as she ascended the stairs, surprised her from behind and forced her into an empty bedroom where music was reportedly playing.

#7  You must believe that those two 'slobbering' drunk teen age boys allowed this teen age girl to slip their grasp during their 'tussling' and escape to the restroom across the hall where she took refuge and locked the door.

#8  you must believe that one of those two 'slobbering' drunk teen age boys then turned down the reported music which was playing in the empty bedroom before their arrival, then proceeded noisily back down the stairway laughing and talking about the teen age girl who escaped into the bathroom.
 
#9  You must believe that the young teen age girl upon hearing the two reportedly 'slobbering' drunk boys noisily descend the stairway talking and laughing about her as they returned to the 'gathering',  followed suite to leave the gathering.

#10  You must believe that upon descending the stairway from 'up stairs' the young teen age girl then walked past everyone at the gathering who she claims were laughing at her at this point, one of them presumably being her own best friend.

#11 you must believe that she walked right past her best friend without saying a word to her and left the premises never to return.

#12  You must believe the young teen age girl upon leaving the party returned home by means unknown without any memory of how she did so or with who.

#13  You must believe that the young teen age girl who left the 'gathering' after reportedly being sexually attacked did so leaving her best friend behind,  by her self in the house with four drunk boys two of which were slobbering drunk that she reportedly knew to be sexual predators.

#14  you must believe that Christie Ford then never once said a single word to her best friend that she had left behind with those sexual predators for over 36 YEARS pertaining to the events that had transpired that evening.

#15  you must believe that the four people Christie Ford named as being present at that gathering, one her own best friend have all said they cannot recall such a gathering or any of the events she described ever occurring, none the less we must still believe Christie Ford.

#16  You must believe that the events she claims took place so affected her life that it caused her constant grief and stress, yet she still never once mentioned it to her best friend for over 36 years.

#17  You must believe that grief and mental stress was the sole cause for her having a second front door installed in her Alta Vista California home which is just a short distance from the Google HQ, and is in no way related to the fact she and her husband rent rooms to hopeful interns seeking jobs at said Google Corporation.

#18  You must believe that despite the fact she has been photographed wearing a pink hat at anti Trump rallies, and her entire legal representation consists of clinton lawyers and democrat party legal experts, she is no political activist and she has no connection to the democrat party.

#19  You must believe that christie fords psychological expertise and association with the infamous CIA had no bearing on her testimony before the Judicial Committee or her bizarre activities while conducting her testimony or the construction of her testimony.

#20  You must believe that this woman who admittedly abandoned her best friend to the whims of people she claims to have known were sexual predators with no apparent concern for her well being has the best interest of this nation in mind with her last minute accusations of incidents that supposedly took place over 36 years ago.

9krhvc,1,2018-10-02,Have to make big discussion with choosing a job Looking for help or insight please!,theflyeman63,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9krhvc/have_to_make_big_discussion_with_choosing_a_job/,"I currently work at an Life Insurance company as an Associate Application Developer supporting the mainframe. I achieved my Bachelor's in Information Technology with a Minor in Business Studies. It's entry level, and I got a bit of a headstart via internship. My pay is $43,000 and a city with the best cost of living! Is there much opportunity here though? No.

My main issue with my current job is this. At the time of my internship, my intern manager told me about the mainframe position and said he was looking for someone to fill the role for at least 3 years. I said sure, seemed like something fun and different to learn. The team manager retires, and we get a new manager. Fast forward and I get an official offer for the full time position as an Associate Application Developer. I did not apply to anything else  because I was led to believe that I had to commit a certain amount of years, but the official offer said nothing about committing to anything. The pay was $43,000, and in actually was not much of a bump up of my hourly $20. If things would have been different I would of applied and took the Leadership Program position which is an entry level position assigned to your area of interest with lots of opportunity and better pay, roughly $55K and up! I felt cheated! I had to take the offer just for stability and making sure I had a job, but when I learned I didn't have a commitment to work a number of years I was angry. And guess what? My intern manager was fired! 

So recently I get a call about a position in Columbus Ohio, which is 3 hours away, at a Bank doing mainframe work. I get trained, get presented with growth, leadership, and networking opportunities. The pay is 55k in an entry level job. Clearly the cost of living is more, but things will still be relatively cheap due to being the midwest and I get to save money. I can honestly say at my current position I am not saving much, working on getting rid of debts.

Me and my wife just had a baby and we have agreed she stay home until he goes to school. Worst case, she will look for work if she has too. I am going to be honest here, is doing mainframe stuff something I want as my dream job? No, I want to do game development, but that industry is hard to get into and I am learning on the side to make some demos of games, build my portfolio, etc. Part of me is like what is the point of taking another position that I don't ultimately want to do, but my family has got to eat and I got to build for the future.

So to me, it makes sense to take the higher paying position with better growth and opportunity, despite it not really aligning with my dream job. And I feel my wife has better opportunity too in Columbus when she begins her job hunt back up.

Forgive me, but I also raise the question of this. Do I negotiate my current job position pay? I can try to see if my employer will counter this offer and I potentially get higher pay while staying in my current city. The only advantages I see to that is it's easier and the cost of living is better, but I miss out on opportunity. Thoughts on that?

TL/DR: Current Entry Level Job in Low Cost of Living City is $43k as Mainframe Developer. Took position and didn't look for better opportunities thinking I had a commitment to the position via verbal agreement. Turns out that was BS, as official offer had nothing of commitment and manager was fired. I missed out on Entry Level Leadership Program that had pay of 55K with better opportunity and growth. I feel cheated!New job offer is from Columbus, Ohio, which is 3 hours away, for 55k in a similar Leadership Program, doing mainframe stuff. Yeah cost of living is a bit higher, but better pay. Ultimately neither of these jobs present something I want to do in life, which is making games, which I have low experience in but I gotta make a living. Do I take the new position or negotiate pay with old position?

Thanks everyone in advance, looking forward to your insights!"
9kryuj,1,2018-10-02,[A4A] Literate M x M Fandom Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9kryuj/a4a_literate_m_x_m_fandom_romance/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible. &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

N1njastar28

Hope to rp soon!

I think they're trying to get away with it under the guise of it being an educational experience, as she has little experience in this field.

This doesn't seem very ethical let alone legal to me. Could even be a scam. Curious to hear your thoughts."

Here are some ideas we can go with.


- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc 

- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me 

- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.



THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)  


I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

 

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

Reddit admins censorship, links to professors who give work to interns and take all the [credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kimmel#Allegations_of_sexual_harassment,_bullying,_and_academic_misconduct)

Why, it's almost like they hate you! Feelsgoodman.jpg

It's a theory I have, where guys secretly love having femenism and SJW as their heel. ""They called me toxic masculinity, at least that means I'm masculine!"" ""they are taking my free speech! The [rules are being broken!""](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7x4pyy/play_the_game_dont_spout_the_rules/)

Now, the flared/pointed users aside, this is a post for the 99.7% of others in here. You know the ones. The guys frothing at the mouth over this.

#####Who the fuck are you again?

I've noticing a venn diagram, one circle of ""users who are angry about this publicly"" almost completely overlapped with ""Users who have never posted so much as a field report"", so as I like to call them, consumers. this isn't Gamergate, you're not consumers having a consumer revolt, you're the product, given free reign to post, learn, to swap notes.

And you've completely wasted it, then think of yourself as a bastion of free speech when someone takes away your precious crutch. When the fuck have you used it? 300k members. If every single one of you posted one field report, once a year, this would be overrun with content. 

Even if half of those subs are inactive accounts, lurking SJW looking for outrage porn, sock puppets and data miners, thats still enough to dwarf the content posted right now.

Why would you expect reddit admins to take you seriously, you've never taken yourself seriously. There was a weekly self improvement thread, barely any engagement. Very loose posting requirements (have a point, flesh it out, try it first, fail and learn). Now a lot of posts get removed with explanation most aren't. So long as you aren't a retard to the mods, you get as many kicks at the can as required.

So the next time you want to give a comment in here about what ""WE"" should do, what ""WE"" need to do and what ""WE"" could do if ... think to yourself

Who the fuck is we? did you miss the 101 level stuff in the sidebar, no one gives a shit about men, except for what they provide? What, did you think it was different here because we have some edgy posters? Have you started to get laid, once you stopped acting like a delusional co dependant and started to gain a bit of dignity, self respect, and a few pounds of muscle?

I've checked back on TRP.RED. Ex_addict_Bro abd bancroft are the two tippers so far, a handful of blogs and podcasts, and a fuck ton of crickets. Do I see content here about the positive masculinity that everyone treats as sacrosanct? So I see youtube channels, new blogs, Tweets of value?

I just see impotent rage. children mad that dad took their toy away. 

This is why I am cynical towards my 300k brothers in here. For the few hundred guys who this doesn't apply to, don't come in here defending what you've done, we already know this isn't about you. this is to the LARPERS who are:

&gt; The best of men, except for actual men.  What is a beta male?   He is the kind of man who anxiously looks for something to identify him as a man, while doing nothing to become a man.  For him, there's [Guinness](https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/09/real_men_want_to_drink_guinnes.html)

I'll get off my soapbox now. Roosh just got deplatformed, and the RMG want to talk about what to do on that front, then do another reading of my speech on 21 con to give it more polish.

the topic is on self sabotage, or, stepping on your own dick and analyzing the footprint if anyone is interested. Like last time, after I give it, I'll clean up and make a post for the guys who don't like paying money for things.

9ku7uu,1,2018-10-02,I (22F) am debating whether or not to break up with my boyfriend (22M) over an incident that occurred when he was blackout drunk.,Soapsudder,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ku7uu/i_22f_am_debating_whether_or_not_to_break_up_with/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost eight months now. I don't want to bore anyone with the gushy details of our relationship, but I have been immensely psychologically and physically screwed over by a few men before I met him, and he has been my saving grace and my go-to since we became official in May after being exclusive starting March.

Fast forward to last week--uncharacteristically he started becoming distant out of really nowhere. He's dealing with work, school, and a demanding internship and the stress really caught up to him. On Wednesday when I called him out for being short with me he revealed that he had been sued for a large sum of money. He asked for space while he dealt with his emotions, and I, understanding, gave him some but asked to be notified when he was feeling better. I was going out of town for the weekend to visit my large family, and told him I was going to block his number so I wouldn't be sitting around waiting for him to call.

Friday comes around and I fly out around 4. His house was throwing a party as a celebration for the school year starting, and I knew an old friend would be there so I asked her to keep an eye on him. ""he's stressed,"" I told her, ""and I don't want him to do anything dumb or get too drunk.""

The next morning, she texts me to let me know she was so sorry, but she saw him kissing a girl on the makeshift dance floor.

I have never felt a feeling like this betrayal, and after flying into a rage, I let him know that I knew what happened.

He had no idea what he'd done. He had taken 13 shots and had blacked out. According to my friend, the girl he was making out with did not appear to be very drunk, meanwhile my boyfriend was swaying back and forth and couldn't form sentences. He did dance with her (or tried his hardest too) and they made out for an unknown amount of time.

What should I do? Should I try to move on and make it work with him? He feels awful and has apologized profusely over and over, and I don't want to throw away 8 months of this relationship we've built over something that he can't even remember happening.

But, a part of me can't even stomach the thought of him doing this again if I decide to move on with the relationship. I know ultimately I'll make my own decision, and my friends all have their opinions on the situation, but has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? Blacking out is something I am very familiar with and have done (inadvertently mostly) many times, so I do believe him when he says he doesn't remember. 

It's such a grey area. Help."

9kw3bz,5,2018-10-02,I feel invisible at work. Any tips to stand out or at least be seen?,millipenny06,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/9kw3bz/i_feel_invisible_at_work_any_tips_to_stand_out_or/,"Hi there,

I just finished my 4th month out of 12 months internship and frankly, I feel invisible. My other intern coworker is much more exuberant, assertive and speaks swiftly what is on his mind, whereas I am fairly quiet and usually talk when there's something to be said. I'm not sure why I feel invisible at work, but I can easily make new friends and talk to people easily during networking events, etc.

Though I did notice in the beginning of my internship when things were exciting and new, I was friendly to people, talkative, spoke freely etc. However, as the months progressed and made some mistakes here and there with my tasks/work papers– that's when my confidence went down. I slowly felt that I disappointed my manager(s) to the point that one of my managers asks the other intern for work favours instead (sort of like favourtism or perhaps they're just more comfortable with him). And when I do get to do tasks from them, it's often because I ask for work rather than being given work. I've been thinking of creating small projects on the side that would help make my work easier (make things automatic) to stand out at work.

My coworkers are extremely nice and polite though there are just some days it feels like I'm invisible and that they won't even notice I'm gone as I'm not needed as much?

Anyway, that's my story in a nutshell. That being said, do you sometimes feel like this and how did you overcome this obstacle?

9kw6tl,5,2018-10-02,Give up internship to care for brother?,MapleBurntCream,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/9kw6tl/give_up_internship_to_care_for_brother/,"Hey everyone,

In short, my brother was just diagnosed with cancer, ""stage 3 rhabdomyosarcoma"", we are young and live with aging parents, I just started an internship but I need help deciding if I should quit to stay at home and support him.

My brother was just diagnosed a week or so ago and immediately started chemo.

For context, we are both in our early 20s and live at home with our aging parents. Our parents own a business and due to the nature of it, they are stuck working there practically all day everyday, and as much as they'd like to drop it and help my brother, it's not a possibility. 

Everyone is trying their best to keep up proper hygiene and food safety, however we are a house full of already depressed people. The house is a mess and as hard as we try to clean it we just don't have the energy and it's not enough. My parents know very little about food safety and I am doing my best to teach them but it's not happening fast enough. The chemo has already begun since a week ago, his immune system is probably already very weak. I'm absolutely terrified.

We just aren't doing enough to keep him safe and I'm terrified that he will get sick. 

I am a university student who managed to get an internship at a dream company in a great position but right now all I want is to be able to be home to support my family, to spend the whole week cleaning properly and planning food and keeping my brother company. To me it feels like if I don't quit to help out and something happens I will regret it for the rest of my life. 

Essentially, I need advice from people who understand how I am feeling as to whether or not quitting right now would be an overreaction or the right decision. 

The job is 8.5h a day, 5 days a week, and requires 3 to 4 hours of commuting by transit each day. This basically leaves me no time to help out at home. If I quit now though, even though my work has said they will support this, there is no guarantee that I can get an internship like this again. 

My school's coop (internship) program has said that while they would understand my decision, quitting the internship could very well mean not being a part of the program anymore, which where I live means student internships are very hard to come by, and internships are a necessity for my field of study to find a job.

The main thing holding me back from quitting right away is that my family has been pretty insistent that they don't want this to get in the way of my internship and future. My parent's want to be able to just handle it and not give me or my brother any pressure (but they aren't doing enough because they can't) and my brother always insists that I don't have to take days off to come to major things like his first chemo session, so I'm worried me quitting my internship will make him feel he is responsible for it. 

So... I still feel like I want to quit, because even if my career path isn't so straight anymore, I have hope that I can always work hard and find other opportunities. But am I overreacting? Is quitting my internship unnecessary and just going to stress my family more? What would you do?

I would really appreciate your input. Thanks for reading my wall of text."
9kwi4b,1,2018-10-02,I (26M) have run out of empathy for my (27F) wife. She seems highly sensitive and finds problems everywhere.,Bendix,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9kwi4b/i_26m_have_run_out_of_empathy_for_my_27f_wife_she/,"Ok so, we've been together for almost 4 years. This might be half venting half ""pls give me some tips"" so I apologise in advance.



I met her while she was doing a paid internship in a city where she was alone. We moved together soon after because we both needed a roommate to cope with high rent costs and it went from there. 


I had a really shitty job back then, and we both have jumped three jobs since, almost at the same time.



She got let go of her first job due to restructuring, and took her 6mo to find another one because she was stuck in this particular position. Once my family worked her mind she looked into HR and found something within two weeks.
During the time at her first job, she'd come back crying once a week at first, and most of the days towards the end. The place was messy, but she just couldn't stop trying to fix everyone and would get everyone against her, from what she'd only see that everyone was being a dick.
Ok, I understood what was going on, helped her through, gave a shoulder and advise and all good.



Second job, starts GREAT, she loves it. Within 6mo to 1 year she started developing this difficulty with this person whom with she interacted often because that person wasn't doing ""what they are supposed to"" and she was being asked for things that ""are not my job"" etc.
Crying days started again, her boss was on her side, but that was still not good enough for her to feel at ease. She was doing her job just fine, everyone loved what she did, but all her focus seemed to be on what this other person did instead.



I finally got a really great job with a 50% pay increase and the best of all, back in the town where she went to school and where all her friends are. I figured it was a 10/10 because she wouldn't be alone and her friends could support her too, she could have fun etc.


So we moved, but she had to quit. She barely looked for a job but got lucky with a recruiter that hired her for a sister company of the recruiting one.



Well here we go again. It started OK, but she cannot for the fucking love of God, mind her own business. Apparently this place is not really good with following federal guidelines for HR shit or whatever, and she does. Problem is that all she can see is that everyone else is doing it wrong.


Crying days are back up to almost every day and she wanted to quit. We discussed if she had any debt, and apparently me playing for everything doesn't help at all for her to be able to pay for her CC. She still.wanted to quit. I took a day to cool.off and convinced her that it was a bad idea.
She started going to some kickboxing classes with some new girl friends she made, it was all going great, but apparently the guys are not pumping her up as much as the other girls. I find this pretty hard to see and I think she's seeing some stuff out of context.



Anyway, I honestly don't know how to help her anymore.
Im finding really hard to believe that everywhere she goes or anything she does has a problem. I feel like she gets easily offended, and I'm the complete opposite. I can ignore things, move on and simplify situations. If someone doesn't like me either I try to play the game to find a neutral spot or I just move on. I tried to show her my ways of coping with things but she just blames herself saying that she's a dumbass.



I don't like feeling this and honestly is really really pushing me apart, I'm just tired of having to always be fixing something, I can't just enjoy a day without hearing all the bitching. Has anyone gotten a SO out of this kind of hole they seem to be in?

Some days I feel like breaking up, but I cant do it in her current mindset, I'm starting to feel trapped.

You said you were six months pregnant, and had had an accident. These things happen - I know this. But you didn’t have any money to buy a new pair of pants and needed some help. You said you were embarrassed and didn’t want to have to ask a man for help, so you approached me, the closest sympathetic-looking woman in the mall.

I froze up. I had a long day at my social work internship and was starting to feel some compassion fatigue (and physical fatigue). I didn’t want to extend my shopping trip longer than I had to. I said I thought I had some cash, but when I pulled out my wallet, I only had $1. I gave it to you, with my apologies and best wishes. You seemed disappointed and still desperate for help, but thanked me and walked away.

A few minutes later, the guilt started to set in. I should’ve helped! I’m a social worker in training, I’m probably better equipped to handle this than anyone else in the mall! I looked around the store for you after I checked out, but you were gone. As I drove home, I prayed that God would protect you and your baby, and that someone else came along and helped you when I didn’t.

***
Just needed to vent a bit. I feel so awful for not helping a fellow woman out in her time of need. I know I did all I could in the moment, but I can’t stop thinking about how that lady was vulnerable and in need, and I didn’t help. Any tips from fellow empaths would be highly appreciated. 💙

EDIT: Okay, you guys are probably right about it being a scam or something. I tend to be fairly naive to these things and I’m a sucker for helping people. Perhaps this was a lesson in self-protection and skepticism? Needless to say, feeling a lil better now."

Here are some ideas we can go with.


- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc 

- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me 

- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.



THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)  


I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

 

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

How much rent can I afford?,queenblanket,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9kxh8p/is_moving_out_a_viable_option_how_much_rent_can_i/,"Background: I am currently a 20 year old college student in my junior year of college. I’m going for Accounting and Information Systems and plan on getting my CPA so I will be going to college for five years in all.

This summer I started a wonderful internship where I make double the hourly pay I did last year and started toying with the idea of moving out. I currently live with my mom and her house is only 2-3 miles from campus but I would really like the independence of living on my own. I’m thinking about moving out at the start of the 2019-2020 school year.

Right now I’m working around 25 hours a week and bringing home $1,220.00 a month but during the summer I work full time and bring home about 2,112 a month. I will be staying at this company until the spring of 2020 when I start a public accounting internship. A room (not a full apartment) around here typically runs about $400 a month (some include utilities, some don’t).

My schooling is being paid for through grants and my car is fully paid for so I have no debt. My car insurance is about $650 every 6 months and I generally eat pretty cheap (beans and rice). 

Would it be stupid to move out next year? I know the general rule is rent shouldn’t be more than 30% of your income but that’s next to impossible for most students around here.

If Ant or Jim and Sam went through and made it entertaining like they used to do with Stern audio or any other radio beef currently going on it may spark something memorable.

O and A had a lot of listeners convinced that they had Stern in their crosshairs and that they were somehow on his level.  Even though it was a total farce.  Now they hide from some no name YouTubers and a fucking chat forum?  THATS laughable.

Not to mention the Braunheiser revelation that is definitely interesting and allows them to revisit the jocktober/Terry Clifford saga without trying to recreate anything.  All your listeners really want is O and A anyways.  If they had any sense they'd be milking this.

Opie on the other hand has somehow made like Andy Dufrein and is being washed clean in the rain.  He just had to crawl through shit after being punished for crimes he didn't commit.

I don't think he needs to, but I think this is a great opportunity for the Opster to come forward with his take.  He could even go through the docs clip by clip.  It's up to him though and I'd understand if he'd rather just move on.

Today was the third and they sent it off fort a lymphoma panel. Whyyyyy body.

—-

Let’s start nearly 4 months ago, in June. I had a granular growth at the back of my throat for as long as I could remember that suddenly got bigger and felt like I had food stuck there or my pills stuck. My primary doc referred me to my ENT who I adore. She was concerned it might have some suspicious cells and because I’m high risk for bleeding, we decided to put me under to remove it instead of an in-office procedure. It grew back in less than 2 weeks so she cauterized it in office (fun). It came out to be tonsil cells making a home at the dead center of the back of my throat (wtf?)

  From June my tonsils swelled up horrendously and I was tested (negative) for strep, mono, and put on two types of antibiotics with no reduction. I posted with my huge ass tonsils with white puss spots on the sub. ENT was baffled. Got those removed in August and tested and everything came back as tonsil tissue. Super sucky recovery, and since I’m a therapist, I was out of internship and didn’t get enough hours for the semester. Fuck me right? 

Fast forward to late Aug and my lingual tonsils and my tonsils that were farther back began growing UP into my mouth. They look like they are trying to move into the place my tonsils were. I called it my “chicken nugget”. Was put on steroids to see if it was an inflammatory response. No dice. Thrown into a mania episode from the steroids (live and learn).  She says she’s never seen someone grow their tonsils back so soon, not even children, and swears she removed them (she’s great I swear) and is now very concerned. Lymphoma might be a cause.

Today I got a “tonsillectomy revision” where those got cut out and sent off to do a full lymphoma panel. Luckily this semesters (redo) internship site has gotten me plenty of hours so far where I’m not worried to be out for recovery. 

Can anyone relate? I have the WORST x-men power."

I am a millenial. Grew up not poor, but never really had the newest and coolest. A lot of hand me down stuff and had a SNES well until PS1 superceded the PSX. (I hope to not come out as some punk ass who thinks he was poor living thug life)

One time, I got the rugrats VHS stuck in the VCR. Looked at it and saw it could be opened with moms tool set.

I was mesmerized by the circuit layout, how it all looked like a small city. And when I plugged it in, it all came to life. 

I then opened a radio we got from a yardsale. Then some of my electronic toys over time. Didn't try to circuit bend or anything, just to check out what it all looked like beneath the shroud. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I got older, I began to notice the machine my grandpa played his cards on. Can't remember the brand but in memory, it looked like a generic white computer housing and a seperate, bland baige, monitor. Running Macintosh :) (or was it a macintosh running windows...)

Did a little word processesing, clicking around. He said he paid almost thousands for it, therefore, sorta protective. Paint was fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then my mother got our first household computer in 97/98. From rent a center. Spent hours tinkering with paint. Then one day she couldn't afford the bill and the thing went away. Christmas of that year, I got a gameboy color. The purple one you can see through. Oh that circuit board...

&amp;#x200B;

Then the matrix hit mainstream, Y2K was a thing and the possibility of computer catastrophe was all the chatter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then Y2K passed.

&amp;#x200B;

So flash forward myself into middle school. By now I owned a PS2 and was deeply into art. I loved drawing stories of the anime I would watch. Trying to get every detail of these machines, like the ones I saw in Gundam. Then mom got our first permament family computer. At first she was liberal with our access. We got AOL, away into the chat rooms I went... Kinda a weird dark area of my geek life. Funnily... Sometimes posing as a lesbian to get into these cyber chats. 

Downloading games that allowed me to chat to others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day, I made a real life friend at school who also lived in the neiborhood. He used to enjoy talking about his forum interactions on this site ([forcemonkies.com](https://forcemonkies.com) ?). I was convinced to get an account and pretty soon discovered the term ""flame war"". 

&amp;#x200B;

My first touch of any hacking was when one day my friend came over and logged onto his forum account on our computer. We spent a few hours playing flash vids from newgrounds and [atom-films.com](https://atom-films.com) :) (""super fly"" anyone?)

Then he left. I was still watching videos and wanted to go back in the history to a previous video. I clicked a few too many times and all of a sudden wound up back in the forcemonkies forum. Not only that... I was logged in as my friend! &gt;:) 

I did what any good chum would in this situation 

&amp;#x200B;

""I hereby declare, you all are leotard wearing fucktards. L JENKINS BIOTCH!!!!!! 1337 455 FUCK!!!""

&amp;#x200B;

The next day at school, we meet in the library, he jumps onto his account and discovers he's been demoted and had received a PM in regards to the matter.

I told him maybe my computer was infected with a virus from all those flash games. Not sure if he believed that, but it was all still a good laff. 

I then watched the Matrix again, and soon developed this wonder of ""what does truly lie beneath the shroud""?

&amp;#x200B;

The middle school I went to at the time, hosted a robotics building competition. After school, I'd hang in the tech lab learning how to build a robot out of random shit and actual robot parts (wooden wheels and such). It was interesting learning how to interface with the servos. Learning how to issue commands and read debug data from a censor that detected if it was on a red path or not. Then the Animatrix came out on DVD and the story of B166ER and the war of wars entered my perception. Technology will eventually be what the next wave of evolution will become.

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, we discovered bittorrent. And how bittorrent can essentially let you look for almost ANYTHING. Even found a credit card generator! Could have been some nasty malware. I tried using it once but got nervous whent the first mark didn't work. Then discovered EMULATORS!!! 

I also discovered how actually very compact old console games were. I became the cool kid at school who had these floppy discs with like 5 or so games and a emulator. Would toss that bitch into the computer during our computer labs/library time and Donkey Kong the whole time. 

Then I met this new friend from El Salvador. He said ""you ever play with telnet?"" 

We found out how to chat to each other using the school network. Just kid n play stuff.

Then my family moved to another state.

I was the outcast again. I got my first job at a pizza joint and saved my money for a 1st Gen Nintendo DS. Got super mario for it, it was fun. But then I discovered this thing called an R4 card. And emulator sites were BARELY coming out with NDS files as the titles were rolling out. 

What was truly interesting though was the homebrew community. FUCKING LINUX WAS AN APP FOR THE NDS!!

I loaded linux and porn on that fucking DS and thought I was lord hack. Going to school, getting on the wifi and looking up answers on this DS to all the tests. Got around the network firewall using DNS (not even cell phones had this capapcity, remember????). Learned how to network map.

Then one day, while I was playing with a coke machine to try to get some free soda (could never figure it out though), this fellow student came up from behind me and asked what the hell I was doing. The screen on the coke machine was in some sort of menu state. ""Trying to hack the machine"" I said bluntly. 

He then laughed and pulled out his PSP, showed me that he was playing some old school games on it. Had a library of games.

""Pffffft... Emulators? I'll see you, and raise you my linux DS!""

Whipped it out and showed him my homebrew selection. There was even a VOIP app on the DS! Showed him a chat room with dudes from china just talking to each other. Then the connection stopped. Even though my wifi radio was on, it was not getting internet.

""No internet access"" my new friend said.

""Yeah, WTF"".

""My PSP is blocking your signal"", he said with a smug face.

I was so excited to meet another hack. We became friends, he rolled with a very alternative set. He said, if you wanna hack, you got to be able to sit and write code. 

""What should I start with?"" the golden question rolled.

""HTML is a good place to start"".

&amp;#x200B;

Because of all the school I was missing, my grades began falling behind. My mom barred me from the computer. She then discovered my DS and took that away too. 

Then one day at school, I discovered the site: [hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com)

This was when the Altoids Mint Box MP3 Player was all the rage. 

I can't remember the project, but in one of my web diggings, I found this project that showed me how to make a live Ubuntu disk.

Oh shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Burned that fucking thing and it was like keys to the goddamn city. Loading that CD on the family computer when mom was away was wizard.

I have to admit... That first time I did that, it was the most tantric fap session ever.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I felt like a hack, but what do these skills mean???

&amp;#x200B;

I told my hacker friend about my Ubuntu exploit. ""Pffft, really man? Thats nice..."" I finally was able to hang out at his house, he was running Slackware.

He liked my enthusiasm and said that I should read up on Kevin Mitnick.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to say, that was the first adult book I ever read, outside of electronics manuals.

Reading about Captain Crunch, exploits on darpa net. That dude who got caught by NASA and claims the aliens they are hiding. How Mitnick runs his own security firm. ALT2600...

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, working at that pizzeria led to me being to get my first laptop. Got an Texas Instruments rig. I haunted ALT2600 pages, reading further on other peoples exploits. Phreaking mainly, from what I remember. Downloaded my own copy of the Anarchist Cookbook. Not that I would do anything with it, I just thought it was funny that it was soo taboo.

&amp;#x200B;

We moved across the country again. New highschool, more alienation. 

My DS was now practically a laptop. Running Opera Web Browser,linux, playing my movies and music. At this point, high school was really hard to care about. Before I dropped out, I went to two different schools. The last school i went to, they had a Mac lab. Played with OSX Snow Leopard and developed my BASH skills. Threw brew repos on some of the machines and put in my own backdoors. I even phreaked a bit with the existing pay phones. Got the cops sent to the school when one day I played tones back into the receiver. One time I got a few quarters discharged and then a ATT rep called the box and asked if my call got dropped. 

Then i dropped out of high school and was transient for some years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I developed DJ skills and would play records for cash. Saved up for a powerful laptop and ran VirtualDJ at the clubs. Learned how to not only spin, but wire sound systems and eventually worked my way up to setting up MIDI, lazer shows and operating 24x24 foot LED screens and making graphics for them. 

Running music promotions and learning what bars near the college were best to throw a show at for some good cash. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the drugs began getting tangled up. Ecstacy and acid were flooding the party scene. This new term for electronic music, coined EDM, spread and all these fake raver kids mixed in the scene. The heavy MDMA use caused me to loose my grip on things and for a time I went junky status.

&amp;#x200B;

Selling plasma for yack and booze. Not giving a fuck. Things got so grimey, for cash I dabbled in the dark arts...

When I moved into this sketchy neiborhood, I became the guy you could take your computer to ""unlock my forgotten password"". This hood was also located near a major military base. One day this laptop came in. Same thing ""I forgot my password"". I decided to run a quick a scan and found these files. Classified manuals of equipment and machinery from the era of GW's invasion of Iraq.

""Cool"" I thought. But then I had gotten this weird feeling deep inside. 

Then one day, some how, I came out of my grungy drug stupor and thought ""there has got to be a better way"".

I tried cleaning up my act, quit doing hard drugs and tried to be a functioning member of society. 

My first job as a member of society was selling cars.

During this time, the cars were just coming out with these computer systems. Fords had microsoft products in them. My techiness made it easy to sell all the bells and whistle and the customer had this confidence in me because they could call me for ""helpdesk"" support.

Then one day I had an argument with the Sales Managers, they wanted me to sell more. As if 6 cars a week wasn't enough!!! It pissed me off. It made me hate money. 

I left the dealer ship and bought $10,000 worth of weed (by the way, this is a red state).

I got a copy of Kali, learned VPN and TOR and all that funderful stuff. I was connecting good grass to the city and dispersing to all the dealers. CREAM at the top. 

I did this for a while and was able to live off the life style. It was cool as shit when I would go to the other end of the city, or even the next town over, and some of my product was being sold. Felt like a king pin but no one but my crew of salesmen knew what was going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I got robbed and had a near drug OD. The robbery left me with a deficeit in product. It happened when I chanced doubling up and got half of that on credit. I paid my dues and got out the game. Met a wonderful woman who looked passed all that and helped me recover.

&amp;#x200B;

During my recovery, I got a job at a tech repair shop. Eventually I got my first raspberry pi. Working on all the devices gave me so much experience. Reworking boards, phone repair, laptops, gadgets... All kinds of tech. It was like receiving college credit and being paid for it. 

However, he exploited my talents to the brink of my sanity. He undercut all competitors to get all the market share. Eventually, I was fixing 10 or 15 ipads and iphones a day while trying to run and train a crew of interns. INTERNS!!! ""uuuh, whats a linux????"" ""Oh shit! a terminal"", what kid, they don't show you DOS in your A+ class???

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually the stress was too much. I said ""fuck you!"" and left and started my own IT path.

&amp;#x200B;

My first customer was a guy who had an Audi with a faulty LCD screen in the instrument panel. He said NO one in town wants to do it and that he could mail off the part for $600 but that he'd be without the instrument panel the whole time. 

I told hime I'd do it for $350.

Shit was the first time I ever sweat yo. Taking apart that instrument panel was like taking apart a watch. And de-soldering the goddamned screen without damaging contacts! A quarter ounce of weed later, mission accomplished. AND I was honored with a joy ride because I had to calibrate the instrument panel :) 

When I got $500, I was sold on IT. ""I can do this"" I said to myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started advertising all over craigslist. Got all these small time gigs and building skill. With that raspberry pi and started teaching myself linux and IO and coding. Mainly anything related to serial and robotics, as interacting with these devices makes coding really fun. Like my robot days in middle school. I got work from an engineering PHD, he gave me this project to hack the serial ports of these gas sensing devices. He wanted to save $600 on the proprietary cable and try to make our own serial solution. We got VERY close. He funded all the mad science, I even got an oscillscope and a variable bench top power supply. In the end, we needed that fucking cable. It had a special RS232 chip. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day, I got my first big account. Some national tech company from Florida needed a guy to troubleshoot a network for a hotel. After that successful gig, they found out that I can also troubleshoot Analog, PBX, and IP phones. And from there, my career took off. Installing computer and POS systems for fortune 500 companies. Configuring routers and switches, pulling miles of cable. SOMEHOW, even qualified for DOJ (dept of justice) work. Mind you, even though things got real grungy in my life, never once was I ever arrested!

Now I'm somewhere on the west coast providing support to small businesses. Installing some very high tech rigs using open source and thus saving my clients money. Installing managed networks. Meeting millionairs... The advent of robots is also an exciting part of what I do. Because I studied IO on a raspberry pi and robotics experience, I also work on CNC and 3D printing machines. The future is now!

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't maliciously used a piece of tech since my grunge years. I happily provide the best service at the best cost and people love my solutions. Its some times still magic. Its also really cool how we now live in the future. All these technologies and methods that have matured. The fact that I can now run halo on linux. Apple watches that give us Dick Tracey tech. 

&amp;#x200B;

And by the way, I never went beyond a quarter semester of college. Or any other formal tech education. The only thing certifying me is my N+ Cert, and that was obtained by watching networking videos on youtube. 

This was to sorta offer some insight on the topic of what makes a hack... I am no guru, I admit, I absolutely do not know it all. But this very essential perspective is essential. Because... To hack is to not stop your wonder and utilize mans most advanced tools.

Hi everyone, I've never really posted anything related to my personal life online, but I don't have anyone to talk to about this other than to my family, so I'm counting on this forum to give me other perspectives and honest opinions about what I should do about my relationship. I'm going to write some information so you get the whole story, I'm sorry in advance if it's unclear at times, some parts are still blurry to me... good luck wading through this, and thanks in advance for your help (please be gentle \^\^) !

First off, a bit about me. I'm a 23 year old male from the UK, and I now live in France. Being bilingual has opened a lot of doors for me, and as a result, I travel a lot for my studies and work (I'm studying at the moment in Paris). I'd describe myself as an ambitious but down-to-earth person (I want a good career, but I also want to stay close to family and have one of my own someday). Personality wise, I'm quite awkward (bullied at school and lots of confidence issues), but extroverted as I have become more sure of myself over the years. I can be confident when I want to be, and I do stand-up comedy in my free time. So I'd say that people are attentive to my presence, which makes me fairly popular - even though I don't have a regular group of friends/or a best friend (which is why I only talk to my family). I haven't had any traumatic experiences in my life and I was lucky to have a good upbringing. I hope that paints a general picture of me.

Second of all, a bit about her. I met her in a bar when I was working in Germany three months after breaking up a long relationship with an ex who cheated on me. She's introverted, and is also like me in the sense that she doesn't have a regular group of friends nor a best friend, and is also extremely close to her family. She studies art and is also very career-driven, and can be extremely honest and upfront about her feelings. She believes that if she feels or thinks something, then there must be reason - for her, there's a reason for everything, and very rarely does she believe in coincidences, which makes her a bit of an over-thinker. In terms of her personal life, she has been through some heavy shit (abusive father and has been sexually assaulted). I am highly aware of these things, and I take extra care in supporting her whenever these subjects come back to haunt her. In my mind, she represents perfection - she's beautiful, funny, and we get along really well. I've sometimes thought about her as the woman of my dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the situation we're in today. After spending the remaining two months of my 1 year work contract in Germany, where we started building a fun and solid relationship, I returned to France to pursue my studies, and we decided to continue the relationship despite the distance. I have been through long distance relationships before, and I know the different routines, rituals etc to make them work, so I was pretty confident we could make it work (w/ regular visits and phone calls), and I reassured her about this.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where things start to go wrong. First of all, I entered a phase of extremely low morale (not depression, but generally feeling down all of the time). The return to my home city was a huge hit for me having spent a wonderful year abroad in Germany, and lots of things there reminded me of my ex (mentioned before), not to mention other personal things that were lying around too. Secondly, I noticed that my girlfriend was getting more and more annoyed about the fact that I would sometimes forget to answer her messages and that we didn't phone as regularly as she would have wanted (I think every 2 days is fine, she wanted every day), and we would regularly talk about the fact that I was extremely busy with my studies and work life, and this led to discussions about my priorities in life (would I prioritise my career over her? at the time, I replied yes).

&amp;#x200B;

These two factors (very low morale and frequent arguments), plus the amount of stress from university, led me to committing a terrible action that I regret to this day. I unblocked my ex, who eventually messaged me and suggested we meet up so that we can talk over some things from our relationship. I was completely conscious of doing this at the time, and I am in no way making excuses for what I did next - I'm just describing the mental state I was in at the time, so that you can maybe understand my actions. We met up, and in what seems like a blur now, I slept with her. This was the last time I saw her, and I told her I didn't want her in my life anymore. Once again: I am aware of what I did, it is extremely terrible, and I'm not making excuses for myself. I know I'm a piece of shit for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't tell my girlfriend, because I thought I would be able to forget about it and see it as something she wouldn't need to know because it would hurt her. So, our relationship continued for about 3 months, and the arguments continued about me not answering her messages and putting her as the priority in my life. We eventually reached an understanding, where I said that I would pay more attention to her as a boyfriend, and that I would invest more in the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I would explain to my parents about the arguments that we would have, which she always started since I had ignored this message, or not listened to this or that. She would regularly tell my I had ""the empathy of a potato"" and would tell me she doesn't want to be with someone who isn't there for her when she needs it. My parents would say that I am present as much as I can be for her, and that she is overreacting to me not answering her messages for 2-3 hours, and that it's unhealthy that she would take the relationship hostage because of it. Also, we are seeing each other regularly during this time as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Two months after this, I'm abroad in another country for an internship, and the shit eventually hits the fan. My ex, who I was still friends with on Social Media (she would blackmail me and tell me that if I pushed her out of my life completely, she would spill the beans to my gf), liked photo of mine, and my gf saw it. The questions started to come and I caved in to my guilt and told her everything. She reacted calmly to the situation, and said she needed time to think, and that if she were to forgive me, I needed to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks go by, and I book a flight to visit her to rectify the situation. I apologised to her and her parents, and she forgave me. The two weeks have been a turning point in my life, since I realised how immature I was being at times, not only with her, but with other things concerning other parts of my life. I decided to change my ways, and devoted myself to being honest and acting in a way so that I can be honest about my ways (I've been reading/listening to a lot of J. Peterson). Since then, things have been going very well, she has noticed the differences in my behaviour and seems happier in our relationship. Now, I have moved to France, away from my home city and all of the shit that is there. I am individually happier as a person.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT. The issues about me not being there for her have persisted. She will put our relationship in question if I ever miss a text, or a vocal message, or a phone call. She'll start questioning my lack of empathy (""if you really loved me, then you would have seen that I wasn't doing well and you wouldn't have asked that question""), as well as my lack of investment in the relationship (not ""being there for her""), even though I allocate a part of my budget every month to go and visit her, and an hour of my time every day to call her and ask her about how she's doing. This is all topped of with recurring  trust issues (which I caused, i'm aware of that), and the fact that even though she says she's forgiven me, she hangs what I did over my head whenever I do anything wrong (""you cheated on me once, so how do you expect I react when you don't message me for 2 hours and tell me you're working on a project with 2 colleagues?""). Whenever I try to tell her what I feel or what I think, I always feel like I'm constantly in the wrong, and that in any case, I'm the bad guy who has to improve in the relationship. She has regularly got me to apologise for trivial things that don't need an apology (I was in class for 3 hours and couldn't text her, she told me I could have found time to at least text her, I apologised for this).

&amp;#x200B;

Note: she has also suggested repeatedly that she's sick of the long distance in the relationship, and that I should start making compromises on my career so that I can be closer to her. She's asked me several times to move to Germany (I speak the language and could work there) and that I should orient my future towards being with her there.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: I feel lost. I don't feel good enough for my girlfriend, and I feel hopeless in the sense that no matter what I do, it'll never satisfy her.  Things will go fine for a while, but if during a Skype call I don't smile because I'm tired, she'll say that I'm cold, and that she doesn't want a cold person in her relationship, because that person wouldn't be able to support her.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm being duped, and that I'm being manipulated into thinking that everything that goes wrong in this relationship is my fault. On one hand, I want to make the relationship work, but on the other hand, I feel like I might be happier without all this turmoil.

&amp;#x200B;

Is the feeling that I'm screwing everything up legitimate? Is there hope for us as a couple? 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, there you have it, the short version (lol). I hope it wasn't too complicated, and that you understand the story. Thank you for reading, and if you have any questions or suggestions, I'd be happy to answer/hear them!

I'm in college working part time. I slacked off freshman year so now I have to do everything to make sure I make up my GPA. Life was going fine, but then my father lost his job and it's on my mind 24/7. I don't tell him, but I'm extremely worried. I recently moved so now all my friends are far away and therefore I rarely go out anymore. Mom's pressuring me to get a GF.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of passions and I work on those in my free time, but between work and school this doesn't leave much time for other things. I don't have an internship lined up for next year which may not seem like a big deal. but between my mom having cancer(she's fine now thank god!) and my dad not working right now(Not to mention he's extremely stressed when he works) I've had a huge push to do better and ""repay"" them. Which is why I need to make sure I can get the best job out of college.

&amp;#x200B;

But my issue is mainly with right now. I eat peanut butter sandwich everyday for lunch because I can't figure out what to bring to work to eat. I'm always hungry and it's obviously making it harder to be focused. The new place is far from any gym so I can't go anymore. I've been contemplating going out for a run before work, but I can't motivate myself to do it. I'd have to get up at 5:20-5:30 which will leave me with only 4-5 hours to do homework, socialize, and follow my hobbies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I need suggestions on maintaining stress, what on earth do I eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, how do I find friends, better time management,  other general stuff.

First of all I apologize for any mistakes in my writing, English in not my native language.

I've been best friends with this girl for over a year of university now, we've been helping each other a lot when it comes to university work and personal matters. She's been helping me immensely when it comes to my social skills and overcoming some deep seeded social anxiety. We tell each other everything no matter what and we're very close.

Yesterday we were going to participate in a derivative competition(her idea, the competition rewards top placed students with a bump in their grades) and how I thought the competition worked was: we picked a partner and we'd go through the rounds with that partner until the finals where the best teams would be separated and everyone would be competing for themselves. So I studied as much as I can while still caring for my own university work and internship work but it's been a while since the last time I studied derivatives and I was incredibly rusty. The only reason I was going to participate in this competition was to be the best team partner I could be to her so I could help her get to the final so she could win it all. We went to her house the evening before the event so we could practice on a white board and her roommate watched and this the one aspect of my social anxiety I hate the most: public speaking. Just the fact that one person was watching made me incredibly nervous, I couldn't remember basics, started shaking couldn't speak properly and I knew the same would happen when 100s of students that were gonna be at the competition watched me. But I kept going, I really wanted to help her.

But an hour or so before the competition she tells me that the teams were randomly assigned each round and that we probably wouldn't even be a team during the whole competition. After learning that I couldn't convince myself that it was worth it for me to go through with this and the embarrassment I was gonna have to endure. So I told her I wasn't going to go and she was livid. She told me I needed to grow up and stop caring so much what other people think and that she was profoundly disappointed I still had that mentality after everything we went through(she really is helping me a lot in this aspect). I've been getting better at the whole not caring what other people think but yesterday I relapsed hard.

So at one point she said: ""Not sure about you, but I'm going now"" and started walking looking back once in a while to see if I stood up to go as well but I didn't. 10 minutes before the competition I texted her that I was sorry and that I didn't know this would hurt her in any way but I couln't bring myself to go. Also told her that I was small, weak and was born to be a failure. The answer was: ""Then be a failure, I don't associate myself with failures"". I told her I understand and wished her good luck. This morning I texted her saying I was sorry once again and asking how the competition went to no answer(she always answers instantly).

I have no idea what to do, I don't this to be it between us. How do I show her I intend to do better from here on out and that I'm sorry about what happened?

**\*\*tl;dr:**\*\* My best friend is mad at me for bailing last minute at a derivative competition I was gonna participate with her."

Right now I'm working at an IT internship, that  pays pretty crappy, the internship is over in December. I don't really want to transfer to a university and go to school for a few more years just to get a bachelors and serious debt.

Skills I have now: 

* Web skills:  (html, css, JavaScript, jQuery, a little php and mySQL, and wordpress), I've gotten pretty good at quickly creating responsive decent looking designs.  I've also started working with cordova and created a few, kind poor apps.  

* Design: Adobe photoshop, and Illustrator.  

* Other: Some C# with winforms, very little exposure to C++ and Java.

Are there any specific languages/frameworks I could learn to help substitute a degree? I hear Angular/React are hot right now. My portfolio will be live soon, so I'll have that to show possible employers. Any ideas, thoughts, or opinions is appreciated. "

###1. It seems like many people are not able to get jobs in the field…

Public health degrees are not competitive or rigorous to obtain. Many people fall into public health on their way towards another profession. The job market, on the other hand, IS competitive. If you are graduating from a program which does not adequately prepare you, live in an area with a small job market, do not have a clear sense of direction, and are heading into the job market cold; you are in for a bad time. 

Unlike other vocational and professional degrees, public health does not guarantee a basic minimum income. It’s more of a linear function – an individual already working in the field can expect to gain about 30% more income than without the degree at each step. You know how the lowest ranked medical student still becomes a doctor? Doesn’t apply to this field. A poor skillset, a lackluster education, and inadequate personal mission statement often mean dropping out of the public health field.


###2. What kind of jobs can I do?

The types of jobs available in the field are incredibly broad. Traditional public health paths can be identified through the **specializations** available at most schools; epidemiology, biostatistics, environmental health, health policy, health administration/business, informatics, occupational hygiene, behavioral health, and many more. Within each of these specializations, there are **topic specific fields**; such as substance abuse, mobile health, refugees, cancer, tropical diseases, disease surveillance, HIV, smoking, gun violence, etc. There also **skill-set dependent positions** ,  such as data analyst, geographical information systems, survey design, monitoring, and evaluation. Moreover, finally, there are **geography dependent positions**, such as focusing on international, national, or state, local, community, and individual level focus.

It would help if you ideally came out of a program with some experience and knowing the combination of the specialization, topic, skill-sets, and geography you are aiming for. You don’t need to have all of them figured out – I am an epidemiologist who is focused on health system evaluation without a topical focus.

The next step is to decide your choice of industry, whether private-for-profit, pharmaceutical companies, insurance, some hospitals, etc. private-not-for-profit, hospitals, NGOs. Academia; universities think tanks. Local/state/national public sector: county/state health departments, agencies (EPA/NASA), departments (CDC), community programs. Bilaterals (USAID, DFID) and multilateral (UN Family, World Bank, Global Fund). 

In addition to the above, the public health degree can open doors into completely different industries, whether you go on to medical school, or business consulting.
You are hopefully starting to how broad the field can be. With the same degree, you can work on surveillance of electronic cigarettes among teenagers in Houston, Texas, or conduct water safety surveys for the World Bank in Asia. Carefully consider all of your options and go into the job market with an idea of what you want to do and why.

###3. How much does public health pay?

As mentioned on the MPH guide, my personal experience is that the pay scale in public health is bi-modal. Starting salaries have a hump in the 40-60k range and another [smaller] hump in the 80-90k range. The higher hump tends to be in the public sector in large urban areas, national and international positions, and the private sector. 

Location: Pay varies highly by location, you’ll be hard pressed to find high paying positions outside of large urban areas. Even if you don’t want to or cannot move for work, identify the employers and regions in your field. For instance, in my field of international health there are really only 7 cities in the US I can consider having large a job market: Boston (academia, NGOs), New York (UN, NGOs), Baltimore (academia, govt), DC (govt, NGOs), Atlanta (CDC), Seattle (Gates, Path, etc.). If I wanted to live in say, Ann Arbor, there is still opportunity but extremely limited, by 2-3 positions total in the area.

Specialization/Topic area: Pay also varies massively by specialization and topic. Epidemiology and biostatistics have a reliably high median starting salary. The salary tends to top about in the low 100k. Certain specialties such as health administration or health policy can have much higher ceilings. Within a field, the topical focus can also vary. HIV will have more, and higher paying positions can cause substance abuse or gun violence, owing to federal investments.

Skill set: Within a specialization, the type of work and skill sets you apply daily will impact your pay. If you are performing data analysis, your starting pay tends to be higher. Same with a managerial position, survey design, or other hard skills. The harder you would be to replace, the more you will make.
 
###4. How do I maximize my access to the job market?

Supply and demand go hand in hand, so this will be similar to #4.

Location: It’s a natural rule that higher population areas will have more opportunity. Also, an extensive hospital network, federal and state agencies, international organizations, and academia will increase the number of jobs available. If you are in an area which also has many public health programs, competitiveness will also increase.

Specificity: The more specific the job you are seeking, the harder it will be to get that first job cold. Though you may have a great experience on the topic, your prospects have severely reduced. Therefore some PhDs who have overspecialized may find it difficult to find a job after graduating. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though it may take longer specialization confers higher pay and more job security.

Skill-sets: If you’re really in a hard place, generalize your skill-sets. If you’ve learned SAS/STATA/R, market yourself as a data analyst. If you know a study design, you can be a researcher. Hard skills are extremely valuable.

###5. How do I make myself more competitive starting now?

My number one piece of advice is to maximize your hard skills while picking classes during your degree; you’ll learn soft skills and topical knowledge during internships, other jobs, and random encounters. So, don’t take a class on Refugee Health if it means you won’t be able to take that STATA, longitudinal analysis, GIS, or toxicology course. If you’re certain you want to work with refugees, want an avenue to meet and work with the teaching professor, and it won’t severely impact your hard skills, go ahead and take the course.

Since the PH degree and knowledge is not comparatively rigorous, it’s more important in this field than more others to do an internship or participate in research. Some internships will be an exercise in boredom – try to use the time to pick up additional skill sets. Ask if there is a dataset lying around you can analyze. In general, most people in the field get their start with a job offer out of an internship.

Network. Any deficiencies in your application can be overcome by simply knowing someone in the company you’re applying to. With the nature of grants, it can be useful to have someone send you the opportunity; often they won’t be posted to traditional places.

###6. Okay great, but I’ve been looking for a job for a year now. What should I do?

Start by reframing your experience. If you have other experience, cast yourself as an experienced public health professional who has implemented and managed public health programs. Be outcome-oriented on your CV. Talk about how large the programs were. What was your specific role? How much money was dispensed? Did you do grant work? What soft skills did you pick up? If you are a Ph.D. holder, beware of the Dunning-Kruger Effect. Never be self-disparaging in an interview. 

The higher the level of your education, the more you should broaden your geographical search. Most regions have a job market in a specific area of public health. Southern California may have a lot of jobs in the domestic field, but comparatively few for international health. Hartford, CT is huge for health insurance, but terrible for almost anything else. Ph.D.s in college towns are vying for a small number of positions at high demand.

Try to attend events and get involved in organizations and build your network. You have a much better chance to get a job through a contact than a cold application.

During your downtime, continue to pick up skills. Whether it's a project management certification, statistical language, or brush up on guidelines or epidemiology.

Broaden your application targets. There are many smaller NGOs and programs which you may not know of. You can even look directly at grants.gov to find organizations which have recently won applications and may be hiring. Catalog all of the possible institutions in your area, and check their pages often for job announcements. Reach out to hiring managers cold if you need to. Use your network. Make sure to apply hard in October when positions for the next fiscal year are open.

If you’re an international student, all of the above is much harder due to visa restrictions. Consider going back to school, if you can afford it, to buy time, or focus on the bilateral and multilaterals who are much more forgiving on the visa process. 

You'll find some resources on the subreddit, and feel free to make a post asking about opportunities in the area. Try to get in touch with your local public health school to see if they have a job board. Take all of the generic job advice as well, well formatted CV, follow the job announcement closely in your cover letter and interview, and don't be a dick."
9l1zq1,1,2018-10-03,[M4F] Office Sex RP (10+ ideas inside),mjd931,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9l1zq1/m4f_office_sex_rp_10_ideas_inside/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.


- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc 

- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me 

- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.



THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)  


I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

 

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

9l1zw9,4,2018-10-03,Some guy ruined ramen for me (Or: what's up with american gimmick food?),MoaninIwatodai,ramen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/9l1zw9/some_guy_ruined_ramen_for_me_or_whats_up_with/,"I was in hong kong this summer on an internship and one day I was in need of a quick cheap meal so I ducked into the nearest shop and it turned out to be a ramen place. Neat!

I sit down and filled out an order card and in like 4 minutes I had a bowl of red miso ramen 

I was sitting at a counter so I got to watch the kitchen. Dude basically tossed the stuff into the bowl at lightning speed with little care for aesthetics

now you might be thinking ""What justin (that's my name) you need a pretty well plated bowl to enjoy your food???? You can't handle a sweaty kinda dirty restaurant????""

No! If anything that's actually **better** for me.

This guy ruined ramen because it was the best fukken bowl I'd ever had. The broth was perfect the noodles were the perfect amount of bounce. I felt warm like I'd never felt before

But now I can't go out to eat at ramen places anymore

It feels like the american ramen market relies on lots of gimmicks and sort of ignores the actual ramen part of the food and that frustrates me a lot.

That said I can really only speak for the Austin, Baltimore/DC, and Philly ramen scenes as those are places I live/go to a lot

anyone got any insight on this?"
9l2f5l,4,2018-10-03,Which industries are conservative?,axl343125,askaconservative,https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/9l2f5l/which_industries_are_conservative/,"So, I have just graduated with a degree in computer science. My degree is pretty general, so I am able to do multiple different things. I want to get a tech job, but the tech industry is known for having a strong liberal bent. During my internships in Seattle, people could be very dismissive and passive aggressive concerning conservative viewpoints. This has always astounded me. I am a pretty moralistic person, but I'm capable of logical thought as well. Perhaps because of this, I am able to see both sides of an issue and where people are coming from. 

I want to shake things up in my life a little. I want to explore and find a new place but also find a sector or multiple sectors to work in. However, I don't want to be surrounded by people that are ignorant and unaccepting of conservative viewpoints. Which industries would say have more conservatives in them than usual or a healthy mix?

Thanks."
9l40f0,0,2018-10-03,"A long rant of various thoughts that probably won’t make any coherent sense, i feel panicked and alone and angry and I don’t have anyone to talk to",giantscrewdriver,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/9l40f0/a_long_rant_of_various_thoughts_that_probably/,"After numerous conversations with different normie friends, as well as a clip from a real estate reality show I saw, I am frustrated by a pattern that I’m sure many of you notice as well.

I was at a laser hair removal center that plays crappy reality tv in the room as a distraction for the patients. The agent on the show was trying to explain how he sells a house that’s not easy to sell or high in demand. He compared it to dating. He said he raises the price of the house on the market, and gets other people (paid actors?) to come embellish the house and pretend to value it, such as placing a fake bid above the sell price. This increases the house’s perceived marketability, and eventually the house gets sold to an actual customer. The dating comparison was (and I’m paraphrasing here): “there is a reason when a man is always single, nobody is interested, and then when he has a girlfriend, all the women come flocking to him. By having the girlfriend, he is able to market himself to others as valuable.”

Has this ever happened in front of you? Someone else was easily as FA as you, but then one time something went right for them, and all of a sudden they had one option after another without having to actively search or try that hard? I understand if this happened in a school or work setting it would be because of close proximity. But I’ve seen this happen with people the individual met through different channels.


Example: an old FA friend became a flight attendant at 24. Met a guy in the city of her “base”, dated for about 1 year, then broke up. Within that same year she was involved with at least 5-6 guys in some intimate way. 

Why does this bug me? Because sometimes I feel like the only answer to my problem of being forever single/alone/Virgin is something very simple - I just need to have one person other people see me with in a romantic/sexual way, and that will spark others’ interest and incentive to pursue me. 

Unfortunately, this has to happen completely by chance. Doing that on purpose will not only not work, but someone else would get hurt in the process and I simply cannot do that. Also, another part of me thinks this pattern is kinda fucked up. Let’s say this started happening (found one guy, broke up, other guys keep popping up out of nowhere). Are those men genuinely interested in me, or do they just want what they can’t have? Are they attracted to me, or that because my mind is on someone already, I’m emotionally unavailable and they perceive that as confident? 

These last two questions would also explain why so many people get into a relationship so quickly after one ends. Both of my best friends did that - while their current LTR was slowly dying, they were already bonding with another person they met at work. When the current LTR ended, the new LTR formed only one month after. Why? Weren’t they supposed to be alone/content /happy / love themselves first before entering a new LTR? Oh wait I’m sorry, they were ALREADY confident and loved themselves, and it was their previous SO’s fault the LTR sucked (even though they avoided ending it because , gasp, it turned out they were afraid of being lonely and that new SO was there for them!). 

By the way. The Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson engagement is annoying the shit out of me. It’s all over the media. Not that I pay attention to pop culture relationships, but I think it’s pretty obvious they were having a secret “bond”  the whole time she was in a public relationship with the (late) Mac Miller. But they keep getting praised and congratulated while dodging questions of how exactly it all happened. (Also I’m a fan of both, I’m not hating on them, but it’s so obvious!)

I feel like doing the “right” things - being alone and getting to love yourself first , don’t jump into a relationship, don’t hook up right away, etc - is bullshit. It doesn’t matter. You can be with whoever you want, at any time, as long as they want you back. Nobody gives a shit if you leave someone for them. Most normies are not smart enough to think “hmm if they left that person for me, maybe they will leave me for someone else too!” And then it happens and they wonder why they can’t find anyone trustworthy. OR, they DO think that, and go for it anyways. 

I feel like the “dating” portion for singles is what the “honeymoon” phase is for people who went exclusive into a relationship very quickly. Except the people in the relationship will receive more empathy when the breakup happens. They’ll also make fun of singles who enter a new LTR and say “oh you’re still in the honeymoon phase, just wait until the real stuff starts.” I want to slap people who have said this. Staying single and dating before becoming exclusive is supposed to be the “correct” way to determine if you should. That’s what all the be happy alone and date around preaching is supposed to be about. But for some reason, if you slap the couple label on yourselves early, you can later say the relationship failed because  “they’ve changed / not the same person as when I met them / they want me to change but I won’t.” But if a single person decides not to commit after determining someone isn’t compatible, they get told they’re too picky or have high standards. 

I honestly truly believe I just need one guy to help me break the cycle. I would rather have one amazing guy for a very long time that genuinely likes me and finds me attractive than a bunch of fuck buddies who didn’t care. But if I have to go through the latter for awhile to find the former then BE MY GUEST, UNIVERSE. BRING SOME MUTUAL ATTRACTION MY WAY PLEASE. I JUST NEED ONE. “You need experience to get a job, but you need a job to get experience.” I’m not even getting an internship for fucks sake. "

I am coming from a background of Maya and Nuke, but the more I mess around in the program the more I feel like this is the path that I'd like to take.  I'm currently taking a class that's based around the procedural modeling workflow so that I can get used to how the program thinks and functions. After I finish the course, I was thinking about doing Steven Knipping's video tutorials as well as some of the free SideFX training and looking into getting a firmer grasp of Python. Was there anything else I should look to do to start building up my skills? Are there any other resources that are recommended to be looking at?

9l5uj2,1,2018-10-03,[M4F] Office sex ideas,mjd931,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9l5uj2/m4f_office_sex_ideas/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.


- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc 

- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me 

- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.



THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)  


I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

 

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

&amp;#x200B;

I am a junior CS major at UW Madison, and I wasn't able to find an internship position for this summer yet. I was aware that the CS Career fair was today, yet my course schedule interfered and made me unable to attend the fair. Is there a ""makeup"" fair for computer science and computer engineering internships? What other options do I have?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"
9l6h4u,1,2018-10-03,I just wish I weren't a chronic procrastinator..,Exclusivelorenz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9l6h4u/i_just_wish_i_werent_a_chronic_procrastinator/,"I plan out my entire week in my planner, though a lot of the times I end up doing it all on the very last day. I'm a 19 year old college sophomore. My first degree is in psychology, which I am doing online due to major depression during my freshman year. My second degree is in computer science, which I do at a campus. I don't work, so most of the days I stay at home, clean, and chill out. I could be applying for jobs, doing internships, volunteering, something. But all I want to do is stay at home and do the work that's required for me to get my degrees. ""Oh most college students work, you should get a job"" OMG. I HAD NO IDEA. I know most college students work, but my social anxiety hinders me from applying for work. Actually no, that's just an excuse. It's really because I just want to stay home and do nothing. All of my high school years I did AP classes, flooding myself with work. I never got to have the typical high school experience. So now I am trying to make up for that in my college years. By partying, having sex, and doing drugs. I just want to cherish my last bit of youth before I have to work for the rest of my life. I don't know.. for the first time I'm actually happy, so I think I'll continue this pattern for a bit longer. "

Things weren’t always this way. You can remember a time when just walking through the door used to give your husband a hard on. He used to come up behind you as you rummaged through a drawer, and press his crotch against your ass as he reached around to mash your tits together. 

Send back then was more fulfilling. I mean, you used to look at yourself in the mirror as you fucked and think  l*damn, we could be pornstars* as you watched your husbands firm muscular back move as he plunged his throbbing 26 year old cock inside you. 

But things have changed. Your tight toned thighs are less so, having never really gotten back into shape after the first kid. Instead of coming up behind you to grab a feel, he’s tapping you on the shoulder to ask where the tums are, his heartburn getting the better of him. 


On the rare occasion you do have sex, he’s always tired, and it’s a quick sorry affair. After he pulls out of you, ten strokes after entering, you lay back and sigh, unsatisfied, with his cock barely doing much more than get you frustrated. You might even sneak off to the bathroom to play with someone who’s become a friend over the years: your detachable showerhead. 


Now that the kids are all off in college, it’s even worse. You either putter about an empty house, or come home from work to a house with just you and your husband, with him asking you for help putting in his new anti fungal cream. 

But one day, that changes. Maybe it’s the new neighbor, a 16 year old boy living off a trust fund. Or the high school intern at your corporate office.  Or maybe even a new trainer at the gym, the young junior quarterback. You joined a year ago, hoping that you getting back into shape would spark something in hubby, but nothing. He barely acknowledges your new, tighter abs, or realizes that your ass is firmer than it’s been in years. 

But this new man, he notices. You start to feel deja vu when he looks at you. The desire in his eyes reminiscent of earlier days, when you could walk down the street and know that every man in sight was looking at you like that. 


So, that’s my idea. To be clear, I’m not looking for a one off wham bam thank you ma’am here. I want to build a story. You aren’t going to throw twenty years of marriage away for a quick fling, you’re going to make me work for it. Maybe at first we have a frantic make out in the janitors closet, or the gym after hours. But slowly I’ll wear you down. You’ll end up coming to the gym, knowing that as soon as everyone else leaves, you’ll be peeling down your tight yoga pants as I dive between your sweaty legs and lap away at your musky pussy. Or getting on your knees beneath your own fancy oak desk and trying to get your nose to push against my pubes as you deep throat my cock. A cock, by the way, that is bigger than your husbands ever was. 

Then the clincher. The day you invite me to your house. I show up around noon, and make my way up to your room. You’re sitting in your bed in a lace negligee, laying out on satin sheets as I enter. We spend hours making wild love, interspersed with slow, passionate sex, the kind where we look into each other’s eyes and cum together, in a wave of physical and emotional pleasure. 


The time passes by without us noticing, that’s how engrossed we are with each other’s bodies. It happens during a particularly animalistic session, the fourth time we’ve fucked that day. I have you pressed against the wall, your legs wrapped around my back as I bounce you on my cock, your pussy juices, mixed with the previous loads I’ve left inside you, running out of your pussy down my balls. Your husband walks in, horror etched in his face. Instead of you jumping back and crying excuses, you tell me to go ahead, which I do. In front of your horrified husband, I come deep inside you. My balls clench as I blow my hot potent load inside you, overflowing your gash. 

Well then, I had a lot of fun writing that. If you sympathize with this character, or just like the idea, I’d love to see if we can work out some sort of roleplay together. I can’t wait to see your messages. "

Hi All,

Long term lurker of /fiaustralia /financialindependence and I just wanted opinions of what I should do going forward.

I’m a 26 year old engineer who works in R&amp;D (Aus) with no dependents, currently living at home on minimal rent ($400/month) with $65k salary + 9.5% super (\~$51k after taxes). I’ve always been pretty good at saving money – typically &gt;70% SR. Have no student debt since I paid my way through a double degree/masters with scholarships + internships + odd jobs + youth allowance. Don’t own any credit cards either so essentially no debt apart from my mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

**FIRE Progress:**

* Current net-worth around $122K \[Assets – liabilities = ($445K property + 50k savings + 10k VDHG + 25K super) – 408K loan = $122K\]
* FIRE by 43-45 year mark but likely to push back a bit if I end up having kids
* 1-2 International travel trips a year
* Looking to reach a nestegg of \~1.5M then re-evaluate life at that point

&amp;#x200B;

**The numbers:**

* I current have a mortgage (IP worth \~$445K, interest only) of \~$408k with about $50k sitting in the offset account. Current rate 5.01% pa. Repayments are \~$1500/month with $395/week rent. So very slightly negatively geared once you factor in all the extra fees (strata, etc)
* 10K in VDHG (2 months ago)
* $25K in Super (made the initial $1000 co-contributions when I was 18-20, rest is just standard 9.5% from employer)
* Expenses for the year \~ $12K (includes my home rent, phone, petrol, groceries, health insurance, going out money, gifts, etc)
* This leaves $51K – $12K = $39K to play with.

**Plan**

* Aiming to buy a positively-geared investment property (house this time) at end of the year with the $50k deposit – somewhere in south-east Queensland.
* Aiming to change jobs to something significantly higher than my current pay (I’m underpaid for my line of work – aiming around 85-90k mark)
* Aiming to put at least $10k each year into VDHG

Few things – I know many people in this sub are against the property route, but I’ve been brought up by my parents who were pretty into the property market (5M portfolio, 6-7 IPs) and I’ve seen the good returns it can have. My family has always been comfortable, however I really would like to make it on my own if I can. (Bought first IP by myself and paid for my own uni education).

I will be looking to move out of home around 28 (so I still have 1.5-2 years to have high savings rate) so that I can learn life skills/adult properly before I’m 30. I’m okay with living at home at the moment as I have a very good relationship with my family.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

1. I’ve had a good think about where I am in life – particularly career-wise. I’m not in the standard software engineering/finance/doctor/law areas so I don’t think I’ll easily get to 100k+ salaries any time soon. Would changing careers to somewhere in software or technical sales be better? Or is that time better invested in furthering where I am now and potentially specialising more for better pay?
2. Do you think it’s better for me to hold off on that second property for now until I have more buffer? I know it’s a bit more risky at the moment, but I’m only happy to take that risk currently due to having a large safety net of being able to live at home. OR should I just solely commit to VDHG and put in maybe 30-40k each year instead?
3. Alternatively – should I be just placing more into my offset account (so a guaranteed 5.01% return?) as opposed to either buying another IP or putting more into VDHG?
4. Should I be investing in any other ETFs or is just dumping everything into VDHG good enough for the next 15 years or so?
5. Should I be making extra contributions to Super? I feel like since I'm aiming to RE, putting more money into an account I can't access for a long time won't be helpful for me and can be used better if invested now in something I can access (e.g. ETFs, IP, offset, etc)
6. What can I do to help my FIRE journey?

Thank you for any advice you can give me. Sorry if my post isn't clear - still relatively new to the FIRE concepts."

Jackson A. Cosko, 27, of Washington, D.C., was charged Wednesday with “making public restricted personal information,” witness tampering, unauthorized access of a government computer, identity theft, second degree burglery, unlawful entry and threats in interstate communications.

Cosko is in police custody pending his first appearance, which is scheduled for Thursday at 1:30 p.m. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, according to U.S. Attorney’s Office spokesperson Bill Miller.

The Capitol Police investigation is ongoing, and Cosko could face additional charges, according to USCP spokesperson Eva Malecki. The case is being prosecuted by the Cyber Crime National Security Sections of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.

Cosko was recently an unpaid intern for Texas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee. He no longer works there and the office is “cooperating with law enforcement.”

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

Just like the title says, Iv’e been skating by at my university and Iv’e come to a point where I can’t bullshit/cheat my way through.

I go to a mid level university in my home state (for monetary reasons). I come from a pretty bad part of MD and growing up my family never had money, our lights/water/heat/ac/gas would routinely be shut off due to non payment. 

Graduating high school was great, but finding out about fasfa was a dream come true. 

You’re telling me the governments gonna pay for my education if I’m poor? Fuck yeah sign me up. 

Looking back now, knowing what I know about subsidized/unsubsidized loans, I would have made a different choice, but can’t change the past.

So fasfa was great, I got the money for tuition, hurrah.

But fasfa only covered tuition, I’d have to pay for a place to live and food on my own. Like I mentioned before, my family didn’t have alot of money. Moms works in the military and supports both my older brothers including me, dads in jail, can’t remember the last time Iv’e seen him. 

So whats a kid to do? I got jobs. Iv’e always been good at finding a job. Chic filet, bath and body works, subway, uber, anything I got that would give me the extra money to live and eat while at school. (I still struggled horrendously though, I recall one week where I literally only had stale brown rice lmaooo....good times)

If not for friends (and girlfriends along the way) I more than likely wouldn’t have made it.

So I did what I had to do in order to survive at school, the problem was that I had zero leftover funds for books, those things are a Fucking scam, and don’t get me started on access codes.

Since I couldn’t afford to buy the materials I would ofter resort to other methods by which I could obtain the information. Befriending classmates, grabbing free pdfs from the interwebz, whatever I could do. But even doing all those things, there were many classes where I couldn’t get that material from alternative sources (like access codes fsss). So in classes like those I would resort to cheating (worst offense is math courses).

So Iv’e been chugging along like that for four years now, I decided to major in IT because I like computers, but a big factor in me choosing this major was the fact that the course material mainly came straight from the professor, rarely did we need to buy any books. Over the summer I saved up enough to buy a rinky laptop (that Iv’e run completely into the ground but I still use it cause its all Iv’e got)

Its my last semester and the only thing standing between me and my degree is a calculus class that Iv’e been putting off because I know I can’t cheat and the professor here only grades on tests. 3 each semester and your final grade is based off that. 

Iv’e passed all of my IT courses, plus capstone, I was even able to weasel my way into a couple internships and just had an interview with google yesterday (i don’t feel like I got the position, which is probably what spurred me to write this post) But I feel like I’m an imposter and this class is gonna expose me for the pseudo-educated individual I am. I’m truly scared that I can’t pass this class and I will never get my degree. I’m going to tutoring everyday now, we just began learning about derivatives. 

Fuck

I had to get this off my chest. I feel like I’m letting my mom down. Sorry for the depressing story reddit

9lcilp,1,2018-10-04,25 [M4F] - Insatiable Office Sluts!,[deleted],Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9lcilp/25_m4f_insatiable_office_sluts/,"Most days in most companies have a typical sequence of events. The employees get in at around 9, some stragglers reach around 10. They spend some time getting caught up with their work and coworkers before getting to work (seemingly) until lunch. The afternoon is more work but also some counting down to 5 PM so that the workers can go home and get ready to repeat that process the next day. But Nymph Corp isn’t a typical office. 

There is an unusual ratio of women to men in their main office. For every 2 men there are 8 women and it seems that the women are the ones who hold most leadership positions and any authority. The multi-floor building that is the main office is surrounded by one way windows to prevent anyone from looking inside and all the entrances have guards who are handsomely compensated for making sure no one out of place gets too close. 

Jane has been an assistant at Nymph Corp for about half a year now and she is just barely getting the hang of things. The culture of the company had left her shocked initially but given the compensation, job security, location and benefits package she had decided to accept it. Her day to day was very different from the average assistant’s day. 


It was currently 2 PM and she held a tray of coffees for her superiors that she HAD to get to them in the afternoon everyday. Wearing a simple long gray skirt, a red conservative sweater and simple heels she made her way through the halls of the building hurriedly. Jane was 22 years old and about 5’6” in height, caramel skinned, had a slim body with some curves that would turn heads if she wasn’t so bent on keeping them hidden. Her ass alone, like most Latina women around her age, was large and round despite her small waist. She tended to keep to herself, work hard and stay clear of any trouble.

She quickly walked to Miss Sarah’s office, she was an account executive for the company, and knocked on the door politely. “Mmmm come on in,” said a seductively voice from the other side with some moans. Jane braces herself and entered.

Miss Sarah was an attractive blonde Eastern European woman of medium height and curves that went very well with her figure. She was currently wearing just a black lace bra with her leather skirt, black pumps, shirt and thong lying to the side. Bent over her desk with her pressed against it, she moaned and gasped as David her intern plunged his cock deep in and out of her vagina. His hips slammed into her round tight white ass with each thrust making her moan and scream while he grunted and moaned a little himself.

“Mmmph leave ahhh the coffee ah ah you’re so good in my cunt ah on the desk Jane,” she said between moans, gripping the edge of her desk to steady herself. 

Jane quietly puts the coffee on the desk and tries to maintain her composure. This wasn’t anything new to her at this point but it still flustered her each time. 

She left the room and took a deep breath to gather herself before continuing on her coffee run. Jane knew this wouldn’t be the only such incident today. She walked on and reached the office of Mrs Stacey who usually left her door open. But Jane still decided to knock before walking in.

Mrs Stacey was currently lying on her desk with her head over one edge and her legs over the other with Joe and Frank on either side. She was of Spanish descent and her skin was a tanned shade that many women spend money to achieve. She was just about 5’2” in height and was of a petite frame with modest pointy breasts, a flat stomach, shapely legs and a small tight ass. But what she lacked in curves she made up for with an insatiable sex drive. Her clothes were still on though her shirt was unbuttoned to expose her bra and her pink skirt was hiked up as her legs hung in the air. She had her hands around Joe gripping his ass as he pushed his cock in her mouth while on the other end Frank continued to penetrate her vagina. She used one hand to tap near her on the desk on noticing Jane enter.

Jane quickly leaves the coffee on the desk where Mrs Stacey tapped and exits the room while trying to keep her wits about her.

*One of these days I’ll have a heart attack* she thinks to herself. *Oh well only one left. But this is the toughest one.*

She walks over to the CEO’s office. There is no name or sign hanging over the door but everyone knew that this was Miss Roxanne’s office. She was a very ambitious 31 year old woman who constantly kept striving for more success and kept her physical condition perfect, with a body that would put many girls younger than her to shame.

Jane knocks on the door politely as usual. “Come on in!” This time the voice had no sexual innuendo. *I guess she’s having a normal day today* Jane thinks to herself as she walks in. But she’s wrong completely.

Roxanne is dressed in a pair of sexy black boots that go past her knees and to her thighs, the light bouncing off them and drawing attention to her perfect stockings clad legs. A black garter belt is around her waist and she is wearing black crotch less panties. Her abs are visible on her flat perfect stomach and her round large breasts are held in place by a simple black bra. Her hair is tied in a ponytail and in her hand is a black stick.

“Ah Jane dear, you’re just in time,” Miss Roxanne says pointing at her desk with the stick. “Leave the coffee on my desk, I’ll have it once I’m done playing with these toys.”

She looks down at the three male employees on their knees in front of her who are naked with blindfolds on and their hands tied behind their backs. Roxanne rubs the tip of her stick against one of them and holds it against his cock.

“Now whose pet are you Eric?” she says teasingly. 

“I uh I’m your pet Miss Roxanne,” he blurts out as she strokes his cock with the stick.

“Good boy,” she says before bringing the stick up and pushing it against the cocks of the other guys and continuing with her dominating.

Jane quietly walks out and goes to the washroom to wash her face. She takes a deep breath to prepare for the interview at 4 with the new boy who will be joining. It’s unconfirmed who his interviewer will be but she needs to coordinate it...

So that’s the prompt, I hope you enjoyed it! As you can see it’s about an office environment full of women who are very sexual and aren’t afraid to act on their urges. It may seem like the women are in “control” and that is true at times but some are submissive while some are dominant. 

I would love to hear what you think, this is open to go anywhere. You could play a specific woman in the office or multiple and we can figure out where it should go.

My kinks are rough sex, spanking, hair pulling, dominating, giving up control, flirting, dirty talk, cheating, interracial and more.

Limits are incest, scat, blood, gore and any crazy stuff.

We can discuss further details in PMs, I look forward to hearing from you!

Also I do prefer long term over short term and replies that are a bit well thought out. We can always hash the story together and take it wherever we want. Let me know your Kik or ask me for mine via PMs

9lcqfu,0,2018-10-04,1099 – Hell: Tax Evasion vs. Tax Avoidance,Grey__Warden,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9lcqfu/1099_hell_tax_evasion_vs_tax_avoidance/,"  

  

**Intro:** I’ve just wrapped up a six-year audit/ Offer and Compromise process with the IRS this spring and want to make sure that I am doing everything right when it comes to filing my taxes for 2018.  I do plan to find a tax adviser, but I’d also like to put it to reddit to share its collective wisdom here on some topics. I’ll plan to update this post with best responses &amp; as well as advice I get from a paid adviser once found. 

**Background on Me:**  For the last six years during my audit I generated 30-50k a year in topline revenue splitting my time between West Virginia (Home domicile) &amp; the SF Bay area. Deductions was easy, as 50k doesn’t go a long way in the bay even when you’re living in your car for most of it, but this year I’ve made a little more, at about 400k and should continue to generate that amount for the next 2-3 years foreseeably. I operate an internet-based advisory business. I’m interested in ways to invest i.e real estate, but first I’d like to make sure I am holding onto as much of my income as possible. 

**Topics to discuss:** 

**401k –** This will be my first year contributing to one of these. This will be via the company I am working under, but I am curious. Should I also start an Individual **Roth IRA**? A **SEPS** (Self Employed retirement account)? 

**HSA --** This will be my first year contributing to one of these also via the company I work under. The advice I’ve read on this so far is: 

*This money offers the best tax savings amongst anything in the tax code. You don't pay FICA or Income tax on it, the money can grow meanwhile in mutual funds, etc. and you can pay for healthcare expenses tax free (so you can withdraw from that account only for health expenses, and money that you don't use continues to grow in your account. You don't lose it. Eventually, when you are 65, you can withdraw whatever is left, subject to income tax at that point. But rather than paying for medical expenses from it immediately, pay out of pocket instead, and keep your receipts. (It's arguably better to let the money in the HSA continue to grow vs. actually using it to reimburse medical receipts). Later when you're close to 65, say you've paid for $100,000 worth of medical stuff over your life (including your wife or dependents!). You can withdraw $100k at that point tax free by having the $100k worth of medical receipts (in case of proof needed for audit).*

**Single Individual LLC:** I’ve thought about creating an LLC in Nevada that can be taxed as an S Corp.  This one seems very interesting to me, as It looks like I could save 15% when I pay distributions – What I’ve seen so far: 

*Let's say the business brings in $50k in revenue. The business has $10k in normal expenses such as equipment, rent, etc. From the leftover $40k, you provide yourself a $20k annual salary (I recommend you pay yourself quarterly from the business account). Only the salary (""w-2"" wages) are subject to the 15.3% FICA taxes. 6.2% each for SS from employer and employee side, plus 1.45% each side of Medicare).*

*The rest of the money from the business year will flow to you as the individual (sole shareholder). This money that flows to you is called distributions. (Note that S-corps do not have to pay any income tax, unlike C-corps). So with an S-corp, all income eventually flows to it's shareholders, in this case - just you. You will only be taxed on the income of distributions, but not FICA taxes, thereby saving you 15.3% on any amount that is classified as a 'distribution' rather than part of your 'salary.'*

*The catch is that your salary (w-2) wages must not be too low and your distributions to high. Obviously you want all distributions in a perfect world and no 'salary' but your salary must be reasonable. Generally, 50% wage income and 50% distribution income is ok. But you will not get away with 90% distribution and 10% salary. It's ideal for a one-person S-corp if an S-corp is bringing in at least $90k. Think of things in thirds. Your salary, distributions, and tax-deferred contributions, each are about $30k.*

**State Domicile:** West Virginia’s  Tax rate is 6.5% , but Nevada is 0. As I can work/ Live anywhere in the world and I am thinking of starting the LLC there – I am considering moving, or at least buying a condo in Las Vegas to live in part time and claim as my home domicile  while still be a apart time resident of WV.  It seems like this would be fine – but are their negatives I’m not thinking about? 

Speaking of relocating domicile. Does it make any sense to move any part of my business outside of the U.S.? About 1/3rd of my work is down outside of the U.S. in Europe or Asia. Would it make sense to keep that cash in an offshore account? I’d eventually like to buy some real estate in the U.K. 

**Hiring Staff** – As my business grows, I’ve thought about hiring family or Interns from my Alma Mater. Would this change how I’m taxed as an S-Corp? "
9ld1fh,1,2018-10-04,Outside perspective needed,FreakyCheeseMan,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/9ld1fh/outside_perspective_needed/,"This is kind of a sex-and-relationships question, but I'm thinking I need less advice and more... help with my own issues, so here goes.

Short(ish) autobiography, cause it's kinda all relevant to where I'm at.

Parents divorced when I was like two, grew up with my mom who had a laundry list of health problems, including depression, hypochondria and addiction to pain meds. Lots of nights in the ER, lots of days where she spent 20+ hours in her bedroom, occasional afternoons cycling around town trying to find a pharmacy that would fill her prescription. Dad was involved but lived on the other side of the country, had custody of me during the summers but wasn't really the one raising me (and had his own issues.) He took me camping fairly often, though, all in all a really good dad. Weird economic situation where my dad had money but was a spendthrift, and my mom was broke but had lots of property (grew up on like, 300 acres in the country.)

Grew up very antisocial, super arrogant. Barely graduated high school despite some solid stuff on my resume math-wise. Had a girlfriend in high school, broke up shortly after I graduated. Moved in with my dad to go to college, farted around for ~3 years and flunked out because I just stopped doing... anything, really. Had a brief, sexless relationship with an uber-Christian girl, moved back to Kentucky when we split up. (That was my last relationship.)

Spent some time sleeping on a friend's parent's church's couch, then got a job flipping burgers and later telling people to turn their iPhones off and back on. Had enough money to move into a house my mom owned. Eventually got fired because I sucked at that job, spent some time unemployed living off a collection of horrible roommates. Got really fat. Due to a mom health crisis I ended up living alone at her place in the country for a few months, sometimes going literally a week at a time without laying eyes on another human being.

She moved back out, I spent some time sleeping on her laundry room floor before figuring it was time to get my life together, and that meant going back to college. Moved back to Oregon and back in with my dad, begged my old university to let me back in. Did well for the first year, chipping away towards a math &amp; CS double major.

Had a party that summer, random girl showed up at it and fell into bed with me. (She comes up later.) My dad had been having hip pains all year, and the day after the party he got the diagnosis - bone tumor from metastasized liver cancer. That friend who's parent's church's couch I slept on moved out to Oregon with us (he'd been having his own issues back East), and helped me take care of my dad. With his help I managed to more-or-less keep up with classes until my dad died.

Dad dying was a really horrible day, btw. Like, woken up at 4AM cause he was screaming in pain, whole day of him being angry at everyone and in screaming agony. Finally learned the specifics of what was going on, and me and his sister had to make the decision not to pursue treatment. Spent the night in his hospital room, he died while I was getting breakfast the next morning.

My mom had tickets to visit him, but he died before she arrived. She came out anyway but didn't bring her liver medication and went crazy (like, hiding jars of urine around her room, forgot who I was at one point.) Eventually sent her back to her (very flimsy) support network in Kentucky because A: that was the original plan, and B: I just couldn't deal. I fucked off to Istanbul for a couple weeks then went back to school.

Got an internship alongside classes, mom moved in with me for real so I could take care of her. Spent more time in the hospital and assisted care facilities than at home, eventually got a diagnosis for her back pain - bone growth from metastasized liver cancer, again. Moved into hospice care at home. Had a nice (small) thanksgiving together, then she spent a few days losing her brain. Was seriously considering giving her a morphine overdose (she'd always been very clear she did not want to keep living under those circumstances), but I put off the decision until some stronger drugs showed up, and the delivery was late so she died on her own before I had to make that call.

Finished my undergraduate degree, did well at my internship and sold one of her houses, so goodbye money problems. Fucked off to Peru for three months because why not, applied to grad schools while I was there, got into a couple. Did acid for the first time before I left, and spent a week at an ayahuasca retreat while I was down there. Kept doing acid when I got back. While all of this was going on I made friends with that girl from the party, with whom it turned out I had zero sexual chemistry but got along really well as platonic friends. Shortly before I left for grad school she got unexpectedly pregnant (not mine), and asked me to be the godfather, in the actual backup-parent sense. Been visiting them during breaks ever since, setting aside some money for the kid, planning to move back to Oregon post-graduation to be close(ish). 

Moved to Salt Lake City, started dating which went... nowhere, really. One girl went home with me then ghosted me, others turned me down, ghosted me sooner or just fizzled out. (To be fair, I also did my share of ghosting.) More-or-less quit doing acid (at least lately) cause it started feeling stressful and unpleasant, and only producing thoughts I'd had before.

In my second year of grad school now. Academics are going well enough, but my dating situation is eating at me. On paper I *think* it looks like I should be doing well: I've gotten into decent shape, I've got my life on track, I'm not the most active guy but I've got a few hobbies, friends both male and female seem to want to keep being my friends, etc. Still, I'm 29, I've been single since I was 21, I've been sexually active two nights out of the last ten years, and nothing ever feels like it's changing.

It's been pointed out to me that when I talk about my dating situation, I get extremely negative, and a couple of people have told me to seek therapy. They're not wrong about the negative part... I have a ton of very dark thoughts on the subject. (There must be something wrong with me, this is never going to change, every single sex/dating experience I've had for the last five years has been disappointing, I've got a Pavlovian response where I expect negative outcomes to the point where I'm unhappy going into any potentially good situation, I must just be really ugly and no one will tell me, I'm actually physically fine but too flawed to be a good partner for anyone, anything that hasn't changed for this long can't be something I *do* and must be something I *am*, I'm autistic and kidding myself to think I can have normal relationships, I only avoid creeping people out/pissing them off like I used to by avoiding doing anything that could provoke a reaction at all so I'm just too passive, I'm *still* pissing them off and creeping them out but I can't see the signs, ""being nice and normal"" is like one of those drinking games where you have to remember and obey an ever-growing list of arbitrary rules, I'm throwing away years I'll never get back...)

I don't know. People I talk to want to ascribe a lot to the various horror stories involving my parents' deaths (and yeah, there are some fucked-up moments in my memory banks from that), but I think I've processed all of that well enough... I don't know. I'm happy enough when I'm not thinking about that area of my life, and the temptation to just give up on it is very strong... but I want a family someday (though having a godson helps with that), and it'd be nice if I didn't go my *entire* life without having decent sex (or feeling loved, or attracted, or like my own love and attraction was welcomed, or... honestly, the entire concept of ""Having my needs met"" is kinda alien to me.)

I dunno. How screwed up do I sound? Is there anything that seems obvious from the outside that I'm just not getting? I'm cynical about therapy (I *think* I'm self-aware enough to not be missing things, and I have very serious doubts that our understanding of the human mind is good enough for psychology to be any sort of real science), but I could be wrong.

Thoughts?"

9ldjet,3,2018-10-04,I have no idea what to do with my life.,norghorith,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/9ldjet/i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_with_my_life/,"I'm 22 years old and recently graduated from a well-respected university with a Bachelors degree. I've always struggled to figure out what direction I wanted to take following graduation, and I'm afraid I've made no progress. My degree doesn't qualify me for much (global studies) and most job listings I find that I'm interested in, I don't seem qualified for. Most of those listings are for basic marketing jobs that I feel I can perform in, however I'm not all that excited about. The vast majority of jobs I apply for, I never hear back. And if I do, I discover via research that the company is a scam or a terrible place to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

So many people have come to me and suggested I go back to school. That is certainly an option, but I still don't know what masters program I would want to apply to, considering I don't know what type of job I want in the end. I've had mediocre employment experiences throughout my college years, none of which were *real* internships and I didn't learn much. Quite frankly, I feel I am as knowledgeable now as I was when I graduated High School. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a failure. Sitting at home, spending my time perusing job boards while all of my friends have moved out and began their professional careers. I know I am still young and there is time. I just needed a place to vent my frustration. "
9le2wj,0,2018-10-04,[WP] You are the most condescending person in the world. Today you met your match as you have a conversation with the most ignorant person in the world.,iruleatants,iruleatants,https://www.reddit.com/r/iruleatants/comments/9le2wj/wp_you_are_the_most_condescending_person_in_the/,"""Hey, do you know what time it is?"" a far too chipper voice asks me, and I look up from my desk where I was engrossed on a report to see a smiling blonde haired girl looking at me. I sigh as loudly as I can muster, and point directly behind me as I look back down at my report. ""Look straight ahead at the wall. Raise your gaze up exactly three feet, and you will see a round thing that tells you the time."" I would have left it there, but I remembered that smile on her face and decided to keep going, ""Since you saw this when you approached my desk and still asked me for the time, I will now teach you how to read it. The shortest hand points at the hour it is today. The longest hand will tell you how many minute have passed, each of the numbers is equal to five minutes."" I glance up to the clock and see that it's 11:55AM, and decide that I can spare the last five minute before lunch, and so I look back up at her and continue, ""Let's start with the short hand first,"" and I hold up to count off on my fingers, ""One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven,"" I slow down as we reach the final numbers as if making sure to not get ahead, ""It's eleven, now let's count the minutes. Five, Ten, Fifteen, "" and then I decide to change tactics, ""Okay, that's too fast. Let's do this. One, two, three, four, five. That's one, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, that's two, ""I slowly count out all the way to Eleven Fifty Seven, as that's how long it took to finish my explanation, ""So we now know that it's Eleven Fifty Seven, that wasn't too hard now was it?"" Satisfied, I picked up my report and slide it back into it's folder, and then was shocked to see that she was still standing there, ""Wow, Thanks for showing me that. It's almost time for lunch."" Now she had my attention, and I glared back up to her, ""Yes. Eleven Fifty Seven is just three minutes from when lunch break starts. Since it's now Eleven Fifty Eight we are even closer to lunch.""

""Oh man, lunch is getting here quickly!"" she exclaimed, looking back up at the clock and then peering back down at me, ""I haven't seen you around here, are you new?"" I closed my eyes slowly, drawing out the effort and sighed again, ""I have worked here, in this exact desk, for six years now. I have communicated with you, Elizabeth Jones, fourteen times through email, and twice through the phone. Most recently being last week, when you screwed up and forgot a key part of a project and needed me to bail you out."" I resisted the urge to smile and confidently opened my eyes, and then failed to suppress my frown to see she was still smiling at me. ""Oh yeah, it was really great of you to help, why don't I buy you lunch as a thank you?"" I grimace now, as her words poured over me, so sickly sweet. It had been a year now since anyone in the office was stupid enough to buy me lunch, and so I had to dig in to remember the most effective way to discourage it, ""I did not help you out, I was forced to do so by my manager, and I made sure to file a complaint with HR regarding your conduct. However, if you insist on buying me lunch, I know of very expensive place nearby called Kobe Steakhouse,"" and this time I did smile, knowing that at a hundred and fifty dollars a meal, no one would ever take me up on that. To my dismay, she hopped on her feet, ""I've always been meaning to try that place, let's go!"" I resist the urge to just stand up, to take her up on that offer just to see the look on her face when she saw the menu, ""You wouldn't know this, but the prices there are a little bit above your pay grade. It's authentic kobe beef, straight from japan, and so it costs more than a hundred dollars for a meal.""

She glances back over her shoulder as she starts to walk to the door, ""Oh don't worry about that. I'm just an intern here, my dad pays for everything."" I could think of a hundred different ways to end this conversation so I could eat my lunch in solitude, but as I looked back at her smile, something about it just felt so personal, and I made it my goal to end that smile before lunch had finished. I stood up and gathered my coat and said, ""Will you father also provide gas money, since it is obvious that I will be forced to drive us"". She laughed, like actually laughed and said, ""Don't be silly, my driver will take us there."" Okay, so round one goes to her, but I was an endurance fighter. As we walked out of the building to a car that was waiting out front, she asked, ""So are you married or dating anyone?"" She was a heavy hitter, straight to the personal questions, but I knew how to parry that attack effortlessly, ""We are not yet familiar enough for you to ask me such a personal question."" She doesn't even look phased as she climbs into the car and instructs the driver, ""Kobe Steakhouse, please"" and as I climb in after her she continued to me, ""I'm familiar enough with you to share. I'm not currently dating anyone, Kevin broke up with me last week."" Rookie mistake there and so I pounce on it eagerly, ""Left you for someone better did he?"" I watch her very carefully, but her smile never falters, if anything it grows wilder, ""Oh, Laura is a great girl, they have loads in common. I'm sure they will be really happy together."" My jaw loosened and it took all of the self control that I had to not just gape at her, ""Okay, but surely it must hurt to be discarded so easily."" Again, she laughed, a soft musical laugh that shook my very bones, and said, ""Oh, we still talk. I had lunch with them yesterday in fact, beside there are a lot of cute guys to talk to, you know?"" I took several calming breaths, fighting to keep control, and adopted the most harsh tone that I could muster, ""Yes. So many cute guys. And they will all use you and this discard you as if you were nothing but a toy."" A relaxed a little bit, watching her eyes for tears of liquid, but they remained as dry as ever as she said, ""Everyone does enjoy playing with toys, don't they?"".

I let the conversation lapse into silence, and she seemed to be content, it felt like she was toying with me. She had me on the ropes, but she just stood around pumping up the crowd, holding off the final punch. Mercifully the car pulled to a stop, and I leapt out of the car, taking deep breaths as I escaped that prison. Elizabeth rounded the car and said, ""Wow, this place must be great if you are so eager to get inside."" I took off at what I hope looked like an impatient march, but was really a mad dash for the front door, and as she followed along, I could swear she was skipping. When we got inside, I address the matron, ""A table for two please, and could you ensure the tables around us are clear, Lizzy here hasn't learned how to behave in public yet."" I turned confidently, expecting to see anger on her face, instead there was just a smile there. Was that the only thing this cursed woman knew how to do? As we walked to the table she said, ""Oooh, you gave me a nickname. Does that mean you are ready to share if you are dating someone?"" I collapsed into my chair, realizing just now that I had walked right into that trap. I pretended to study the menu, even though I no longer had an appetite, and finally found a good response, ""I am far too busy working on my second doctorate to date anyone."" I say, which was a lie. I didn't normally have to lie, I only had a doctorate and wasn't planning on a second, but I felt I needed to stoop as low as possible to win this one. She nods understandingly and says, ""Yeah, School takes up a lot of time doesn't it. I barely have enough time with my friends after classes, but thankfully I have the entire weekend free. What are you studying for?"" This was my favorite part of talking about school, and so I proudly stated, ""Oh, it's something that you wouldn't possibly understand, I am a Theoretical Physicist."" I made sure to add in haughty tone to the last two words, but it was nothing but a weak jab that she sidestepped with ease, ""Wow, Like Stephen Hawking? You must be brilliant to do that."" I fought desperately to squash the small bit of joy that attempted to surface from the look of amazement on her face, and tried to turn it into derision, ""Yes, it's another reason why I am not dating anyone. Most women are about as smart as you, which prevents us from communicating at the same level."" Somehow, she cheered up at those words, getting a little bit excited now, and bounced on her chair, ""Ooh, you just need to meet another physicist"" she exclaims, practically squealing now, and pulls out her phone, ""In fact, I might know someone"" and she rapidly scrolled through her contacts. ""Dr. April Ludgate?"" she asks, looking up hopefully. There it was, the KO punch, the victorious, unblockable final blow. Defeated, I looked at her and smile, blushing a little bit as I said, ""Oh my god, you know her?"""

I’ve already went through netacad for the ccna in high school (technical highschool) and im familiar with a lot of ccna subjects. I know what a router, switch hub is and what they do. I’m decent at subnetting. I know TCP/IP and the OSI model. I know what a network is and a few different topics on the ccna. I also had an internship doing some minor things with networking. 

I don’t know if my high school experience and internship is enough to get me past the help desk role. So is going for the ccna even necessary when i can just get the A+? Id be getting the same role..

-Netacad course in high school (ccna material)
-8 month internship 
-Own IT consultant 
-would help out at my highschool for trouble shooting

Is all of this considered experience? 

Should i just go all in for the ccna and screw the A+?

Spilt ~~Milk~~ Ink 

&amp;#x200B;

Omin had become accustomed to Vera’s presence in his office, so accustomed that he sometimes forgot she was even there. Such was Fate’s design.  In the late afternoon, tea was being served just as Omin pushed his chair back from his desk to stretch and stand up. The back of the chair bumped into the tray Vera was carrying. Teacups and pot clattered, scones became airborne, dishes of blackberry jam, butter and clotted cream slid toward the floor. 

It was a miraculous save by Vera. Omin marveled as utter calamity was very nearly averted. Stepping forward quickly, the cups, teapot and condiments were saved and resettled on the tray. All but one of the scones landed safely, though not in their former elegant configuration. The honey tipped but didn’t spill. But the milk, in its delicate pitcher fell the other way. It tipped over and out onto Omin and the papers strewn on his desk, freshly inked in his own fine script. 

There was a fraction of a second when both looked into the face of the other, both seeing the horror and dread spread across their countenance as if they were looking into some strange mirror. Then wordlessly, both turned their gaze toward the papers on the desk, the ink already starting to run. Assessing countermeasures and tactics, Vera unfolded the blue cloth napkins and spread it over the desk, perhaps to draw up the milk, perhaps to briefly hide the damage. Then, having no napkins at the ready, she began to dab tentatively at Omin’s face and surcoat with the sleeve of her robe.

Omin, his face beginning to flush with anger and the little veins on his temple becoming more pronounced, brushed aside this attempt and said loudly, “The docs! Just worry about the docs! I’ve been working on these all day!”

Vera set the tray down so quickly this time, the honey tipped over, a slow stream of thick gold reaching past the tray’s lip toward the floor as her back was turned. She and Omin began to carefully separate moist sheets and lay them about the office to dry, trying not to tear them in their weakened state. Omin would occasionally mutter “Goddammit” or “Motherfucker” at random intervals throughout the process as an important or very detailed sheet would tear or stick to another sheet. “That’s it. I’m going back to velum.” 

The desk was nearly clear, but covered in a layer of milk and ink. Vera went to the door and slapped loudly on the frame to get Omin’s attention. She mimed quickly that she would bring back cleaning supplies and then ran down the hall. To Omin it looked rather more like some kind of fit, or an angry silent resignation. 

She ran full speed to the closet she had found some weeks ago with the needed items. She knocked one intern off his feet and bumped into two more on the way back. The commotion did not escape Viari’s notice. 

Vera carefully walked through the minefield of damp papers back to the desk and began cleaning, lifting items that had trapped milk underneath them, wiping them off as well. If she was quick enough, there might not be any damage to the desk’s finish. Omin was pacing and staring at the papers, trying to put them back in order, still cursing but less frequently, the veins at his temples less pronounced. 

From behind her, near the windowsill, Omin asked, “Where is page 17? Do you see page 17 anywhere?”

Vera looked over the desk again and found the sheet stuck to another sheet and gingerly held both up for Omin to take. As he reached for the sheets, the corners pinched tightly in Vera’s fingers tore.  She made a grab for the sheet, but her elbow bumped the ink bottle as she did so. Omin saw the sheet fall and the bottle tip and grabbed for the ink. Omin’s fingertips on his much longer arm just brushed the bottle and pushed it closer to the edge of the desk, toward the sheets lying on the floor in front of the desk. Vera had also lunged for the ink, but found herself pinned between Omin and the desk, the ink bottle still teetering, spinning like a top. 

The office door opened with a faint squeak. “Is everything…” . Viari started, and his voice trailed as he took in the scene. Papers scattered everywhere. Vera leaning over the desk. Omin leaning over Vera, her face more than a little flushed. “…okay.” He took in a quick deep breath and said “Oh. Oh. I’m. I. Am.  Sorry. To have. Uh. Interrupted.  Um.  Please…er ..carry on,” as he closed the door even more quickly. The teetering ink bottle hit the floor just as the door closed.  

Viari felt beads of sweat gathering on his forehead. He shook his head. He rubbed his eyes. He flipped the sign on the office door to “Do Not Disturb” and walked very, very quickly away.  He felt very heavy footsteps through the floor.  His quick pace shifted to a sprint and he didn't look back, even as he heard Omin's voice calling. 

""Viari.  Viari.  No. Wait.  Viari.  It's not-""  Omin's voice faded with every turned corner.  

Luskin is nice this time of year, Viari thought.  It's been a long time since he'd visited Luskin.  This opportunity seemed ideal.  "

I am 21, turning 22 by December. I already have an AS in Software Development, going back to school to transfer to San Diego State and get my BS in Computer Science. I have two jobs, one a part-time food server and another as a Programming Intern. Sounds like my life is going good right? Wrong....My friends like to say that I am happy with my life when in reality I am depressed and loney as shit. I've never ever had a girlfriend in my life, and I'm at the time in my life where having a close companion would greatly help with my severe depression and loneliness. I guess the reason why I never had a girlfriend is cause I deeply believe in true love. My friends always like to tease me on why I never just get a girlfriend by now...They always try to hook me up with these stuck-up girls that just want a quick fuck or a fuck-buddy for a few months and then just forget about me....and for the girls that I DO have feelings for, they either reject me or have some feelings for me but never want a relationship cause they still have feelings for their Ex. I dont want a quick fuck or a friend with benefits. I wanted an actual relationship with a girl that could grow into something more.

I keep on telling my friends that I want my first love to actually mean something. That should we break up eventually, I could still look back fondly that at least the love was true and perhaps tell my kids that there is such as true love, even for the briefest of moments. My friends always pester me to just lose my virginity and that there is no such thing as your first love. The latest girl I'm meeting....she was everything I ever wanted from a girl and I would have done anything for her if she just given me a chance. Alas, she too just recently had her first love and she simply cannot leave those feelings behind for me, no matter how much I told her I would be anything she wanted me to be. Now, though we are good friends, she just became another reminder of my awful love life.

I'll be honest. At this point in my life, I'm starting to cave in. I feel like a loveless loser because I'm the only person in my group of friends to yet even KISS A GIRL! Its hard to walk around campus and see couples holding hands or kissing each other in the cheek. It just reminds me of my lonely situation and I'll be honest in saying that I've contemplated taking up my friends offer and just mess with one of his home-girls. Honestly, if I do go through with it, I would probably not feel any better about my situation.... Do you guys think Im foolish to believe in first love? I'm starting to think so myself....

Here's a [picture](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/d/d0/1252512511.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20181001021806) of me if you guys need a perspective. I'm the guy on the left with the strip shirt.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I never had a girlfriend because I wanted my first love to mean more than just a quick fuck. Had many opportunities but none ever worked out. Friends offer to help me lose my virginity but I so far rejected it. Lonely as crap right now and thinking of taking up the offer. Am I foolish for believing in true love?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks guys. This actually means alot to me. I'll be honest in saying that I pretty much already knew the answer to my question even before I wrote this but I guess I just needed another group of people to tell me the things that needed to be said. Fortunately, your insights gave me the incentive to go with the friends tommorow to hangout with some new people at this party/hangout they are hosting. Hopefully with a new open-mind I can find a nice girl to talk to. Now I just wished there was an easier way to detach my feelings from the previous girl......if only it were so easy to move on from another one of my failure..."
9lf5it,3,2018-10-04,Ripoff college ruined me,dascott,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9lf5it/ripoff_college_ruined_me/,"What I thought was going to be the best way to get my life on track completely ruined it.

A decade ago, age 30, I decided I would finish my degree. I had failed miserably at college the first time around because of overwhelming anxiety - but medication finally had it under control.

Well, I thought I found the answer. I swallowed their bullshit wholesale. I signed up for a two year degree in Networking Administration, and they told me right up front about how insanely expensive they were. But they also told me about **internships**, and ***job placement***, and how they had an inside track with big tech companies and a whole load of other bull. And I believed it because I wanted to believe it. The act of selling myself with a resume or an interview was my biggest hangup - remember, I have a shitload of anxiety. So much that I failed out of college because I missed a few classes then stopped going completely because I was afraid to explain why I had missed classes. So their sales pitch of ""we'll hold your hand and get your foot in the door"" was exactly what I wanted to hear.

Well I breezed through the school in 18 months. Perfect grades. Never felt better about myself. Right up until the job hunting started.

See, at no point did that whole internship thing happen - but they did say they could get me on at *Lowe's*. Yeah, what? Right so, the job placement and inside track? Once a week their headhunter guy would email a list of links from [monster.com](https://monster.com). They were almost never in any way relevant other than having ""IT"" somewhere in the description. Things like, ""Network Engineer, 15 years experience."" Nothing that the school even remotely prepared you for.

It took me 2 1/2 years after graduating to find a job - and it came from an overseas staffing firm. Again, bullshit - it was a 1-2 year contract where I worked full time but was only considered a part time employee (no insurance, vacation, sick days, etc) and paid $10/hr. After a year, they offered me a $50 bonus if I kept going. Meanwhile, $30k in student loans and hey, foot in the door, right?

It was the only job I ever had in IT. It took another five years to find regular employment. I sunk lower and lower into depression. Filling out an application became impossible. Updating my resume would cause a breakdown.

I'm not saying **ECPI** is an overpriced scamming piece of shit, but that motherfucker that signed me up can go to hell for the bullshit he fed me. I completely blame myself for being fooled but I do manage to redirect some bit of hate for those assholes.

I'm now 42 years old with panic disorder and chronic depression, living with mom, working at a job that I was only considered for because of her, who is so ashamed of himself that I don't even consider attempting a relationship, who can no longer even go into public alone without being panicked, and overall completely fucking miserable.

I thought I had found my turning point. It led me into the darkest pit of my life and I'm still falling.

Just another seven years to pay off the loan."
9lf9ra,3,2018-10-04,Been skating by in college and its finally caught up,StuckOnARide,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9lf9ra/been_skating_by_in_college_and_its_finally_caught/,"Hello Reddit

Just like the title says, Iv’e been skating by at my university and Iv’e come to a point where I can’t bullshit/cheat my way through.

I go to a mid level university in my home state (for monetary reasons). I come from a pretty bad part of MD and growing up my family never had money, our lights/water/heat/ac/gas would routinely be shut off due to non payment. 

Graduating high school was great, but finding out about fasfa was a dream come true. 

You’re telling me the governments gonna pay for my education if I’m poor? Fuck yeah sign me up. 

Looking back now, knowing what I know about subsidized/unsubsidized loans, I would have made a different choice, but can’t change the past.

So fasfa was great, I got the money for tuition, hurrah.

But fasfa only covered tuition, I’d have to pay for a place to live and food on my own. Like I mentioned before, my family didn’t have alot of money. Moms works in the military and supports both my older brothers including me, dads in jail, can’t remember the last time Iv’e seen him. 

So whats a kid to do? I got jobs. Iv’e always been good at finding a job. Chic filet, bath and body works, subway, uber, anything I got that would give me the extra money to live and eat while at school. (I still struggled horrendously though, I recall one week where I literally only had stale brown rice lmaooo....good times)

If not for friends (and girlfriends along the way) I more than likely wouldn’t have made it.

So I did what I had to do in order to survive at school, the problem was that I had zero leftover funds for books, those things are a Fucking scam, and don’t get me started on access codes.

Since I couldn’t afford to buy the materials I would ofter resort to other methods by which I could obtain the information. Befriending classmates, grabbing free pdfs from the interwebz, whatever I could do. But even doing all those things, there were many classes where I couldn’t get that material from alternative sources (like access codes fsss). So in classes like those I would resort to cheating (worst offense is math courses).

So Iv’e been chugging along like that for four years now, I decided to major in IT because I like computers, but a big factor in me choosing this major was the fact that the course material mainly came straight from the professor, rarely did we need to buy any books. Over the summer I saved up enough to buy a rinky laptop (that Iv’e run completely into the ground but I still use it cause its all Iv’e got)

Its my last semester and the only thing standing between me and my degree is a calculus class that Iv’e been putting off because I know I can’t cheat and the professor here only grades on tests. 3 each semester and your final grade is based off that. 

Iv’e passed all of my IT courses, plus capstone, I was even able to weasel my way into a couple internships and just had an interview with google yesterday (i don’t feel like I got the position, which is probably what spurred me to write this post) But I feel like I’m an imposter and this class is gonna expose me for the pseudo-educated individual I am. I’m truly scared that I can’t pass this class and I will never get my degree. I’m going to tutoring everyday now, we just began learning about derivatives. 

Fuck

I had to get this off my chest. I feel like I’m letting my mom down. Sorry for the depressing story reddit

&gt; A Democratic congressional intern accused of publishing the private information of at least three Republican lawmakers allegedly threatened to leak senators&amp;#039; childrens&amp;#039; health information if a witness told anyone about his activities.

&gt; Jackson Cosko, who recently worked as an unpaid intern for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, was arrested for allegedly posting the personal information of a number of senators including Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah on Wikipedia - with information such as their home addresses and phone numbers.

&gt; According to a sworn statement by Capitol Police Captain Jason Bell, a witness Tuesday saw Cosko at a computer in a senator&amp;#039;s office, where he used to work, a day after two other unnamed senators&amp;#039; information had been put on Wikipedia.

&gt; Cosko worked for other Democratic senators including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and former Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. Sources familiar with the case tell Fox News Cosko was in Sen. Hassan&amp;#039;s office, where he was caught using a login he was not authorized to use.

&gt; Bell said that there was probably cause to believe that Cosko published the information of senators, and then made threatening statements directed to the unnamed witness &amp;quot;With the intent to hinder, delay, or prevent&amp;quot; the witness from reporting it to authorities.

&gt; COPS PROBE DOXXING OF GOP SENATORS, AS LEFT-WING ESCALATES CONFRONTATIONAL TACTICS. Cosko is charged with publishing restricted personal information, threats in interstate communication, unauthorized access of a government computer, identity theft, witness tampering, second degree burglary, and unlawful entry.

9lftm8,2,2018-10-04,Me (28F) with my now-ex (33M) (together for 6 years) - I need advice as to how to move on,masterofbirdlaw1738,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9lftm8/me_28f_with_my_nowex_33m_together_for_6_years_i/,"Hi Reddit,

I don't know where to go from here. I guess I just need justification that what I did was right, and that I will be okay in the long run. Please bear with me if you can, this story is a long one. For reference, I'll call my now-ex M.

&amp;#x200B;

I met my M nearly 7 years ago in 2012. I had just started my career directly out of undergrad. I remember coming in for the interview, meeting him, and thinking to myself ""huh, how funny it would be if we ended up together?"" At that point, I hadn't even finished the interview. I had that thought long before I had even known if I had a job offer, or would even accept said offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward about 6 months later, M and I begin working together. At that time, I was 22 and he was 28. I was in a long-distance relationship at that time, and he was in a relationship too. I should mention M was involved with his girlfriend for about five years, on-and-off. The two of us had a very platonic work-related relationship, and genuinely enjoyed each other's company. Eventually, we began going out for drinks after work, and doing other fun, non-romantic activities together. Around this time, a mutual friend we worked with mentioned that he had had a small ""fling"" with one of the previous interns that worked at the company. I genuinely didn't think anything of it. She had left long before I began my position. And so, over the next few months,  I developed a crush on M, ended up breaking up with my boyfriend because of it, and things escalated from there. (Clearly he had a thing for women he worked with...).

&amp;#x200B;

This whole time, I was aware M had a girlfriend; I had met her a few times. However, he had confided in me multiple times that his ""relationship was ending,"" etc. etc. and we ended up hooking up. He immediately broke up with his girlfriend. We began officially dating after a few months. Initially, I didn't think anything would come of us; after all, we worked together and it was a very small company. He asked that we keep our relationship a ""secret"" from everyone at work. I completely agreed. Our company did not have a disclosure policy (I was sure to check), but we worked directly with each other, and reported to the same boss. I didn't want *either* of us to be looked at anything other than professionally.

&amp;#x200B;

A month or two into us *officially* dating (approximately 6 months after seeing each other), I became pregnant. I had (and still have) and IUD, and was very careful. However, I happened to be that 0.01% that had a pregnancy. I called him and explained the situation, and we agreed termination was the ideal way forward. However, his behavior here was so awful, I still can't believe I didn't see the red flag being waved. I had decided to go with the medical abortion, but needed to have my doctor confirm how far along in the pregnancy I was before I would be able to begin the procedure. He refused to go with me to the doctor. Instead, I drove myself to the ultrasound, and as I was lying there on the table, all I could think of was how alone I felt in that moment. I genuinely cared about him, and I thought he cared about me... why wasn't he here for this? I chalked it up to him being ""afraid,"" and convinced myself that it wasn't completely necessary that he be there for the ultrasound. After all, we had decided to end the pregnancy.

&amp;#x200B;

However, once everything was confirmed, I had to go to Planned Parenthood. He also wouldn't go. He claimed it ""looked very suspicious"" that both of us would have had to take the day off from work. Of course this was true, but that honestly shouldn't have mattered. Instead, a close friend took me. It was a horrible experience, a terribly long day, and then I realized I would be alone when going through the worst part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

He called me later that night after I arrived home from PP. He apologized, and offered that I come to his house for the remainder of the procedure. I agreed, and he did a relatively okay job at taking care of me. About two hours into this procedure, his mother shows up to his house. She lives 1.5 hours away. She barges in, and demands he meet with her in the kitchen. At this point, I had never met her, and I was TERRIFIED he had told her about our ""situation."" As it turns out, he had ended up asking her for money to pay his GAMBLING BOOKIE off, to the tune of 1K. She begins yelling at him, all the while I'm sitting there on the couch. It was the most awkward introduction I've ever had.

&amp;#x200B;

The gambling incident should have been red flag #2. At this point in time, he made close to 75K. MORE than enough to cover his bills, save, have some fun money, and, I guess, if he wanted to, gamble. However, he could never save. NEVER. I didn't know this at the time, but boy do I now.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I guess I'll get to the point. Over the course of the next few years, I moved in with him (he bought his own home before I was even in the picture), left my job at our shared company after 3 years, and took my career to the next level at a city about an hour away from our home. When I took the new job offer, I had initially thought that I would have had to move back in with my parents, as they lived significantly closer to the new city. However, when the morning traffic commute was factored in, it still took the same amount of time to get from either M's house (2 hours one-way by train) or from my parents (2 hours by driving or train). I decided to continue living with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I loved my new job! It couldn't have been a better fit for me. However, the four-hour-a-day commute was miserable. I would leave the house at 6:30am and return by 7:15-7:30pm. There was no time for anything other than to eat or sleep. I should mention, the entire duration of our relationship, M NEVER cooked. NEVER. Not once. He full well knew how long and exhausting my day was, but I never came home to a hot meal made by him. If I did, it was because I had made a crockpot meal.

&amp;#x200B;

He left his office around 4:30, and got home around 4:50 in the afternoon. If he decided to participate in any activities (e.g. go to the gym), there were still HOURS left in the day for him to prepare something for dinner. Alas, he never did, and would complain that when I walked through the door at 7:30, that I didn't make dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

For two years I did the god-awful commute. I loved my job, was making a significant amount of money, and thought eventually he would want to join me up in the city. After all, we were both working in the same field. The job prospects in my city were abundant. He agreed that he would begin looking shortly after I ended up taking my job, but I feel like it was half-assed. So, I began helping him. I constantly looked online for potential openings, I re-did his LinkedIn page, helped him re-write and update his resume, etc. I did EVERYTHING. Finally, in the winter of 2017, I decided I couldn't handle the commute anymore. I had waited two years for him to at least have an interview with a place, but he never even so much as got a phone-screen.

&amp;#x200B;

In March of 2017, I decided I was going to purchase a home outside of my city on my own. I knew I wanted to invest some of my hard-earned money in real estate, and I decided to purchase a small newly-built (but very small) home. I couldn't wait for him any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

When I told him I was going to begin house hunting, he didn't want to attend the showings with me. My parents were going to be a big part of the purchase, and they absolutely had some influence, but he showed very little interest in joining us. Once I found my little home, he was visibly upset, and balked at me stating that I ""didn't consider his needs"" for the house. (His needs being that he wanted a bigger yard and a garage for his crappy old Corvette). I told him that my parents were helping me out here, and that they had a significant amount of influence, and that HE wasn't putting anything into this house. Had he been purchasing it alongside me, financially, of course I would have considered his wants. From the get-go there, I could tell he wasn't happy.

&amp;#x200B;

As fate would have it, I had my offer accepted on the home in late March, but the closing wasn't until late June. The same day as my closing was when M actually accepted a full-time offer up in my city. I was ecstatic. This is what I had waited for for SO long! We could finally live a normal life, with normal commutes. I was so proud of him.

&amp;#x200B;

He moved in with me, but kept his house in his city. He did make more than me, but I knew he had all of his bills for his home, so I didn't charge him anything to live with me.  (I'll get back to this in a bit).

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after he began his new job (upper management), he began going out for drinks after work. Okay, fine. Drinks with the big boss? I completely understand. You're brand-new. You have to put in your time with them at first. I met his bosses for drinks one or two times: older guys in their mid-forties/fifties. They seemed very nice.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months in to his new job up here, I notice he's going out consistently 1-2 times per week. Okay, I still think it's fine. I know the guys he's out with, so I don't think anything of it. This lasts for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Around January of this year, I notice he is continuously going out 2 nights per week and not coming home until 2am. I would get home from my work out classes around 8pm, and he just wouldn't be home. I would call him and he'd say ""oh, yeah, I grabbed beers with everyone after work."" I would be so angry that he couldn't call or text me earlier right when work let out to let me know he was staying out. He just would never tell me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got very upset with this, and told him I didn't have a problem with him going out, but he needed to tell me when it was decided. It was disrespectful to me to just NOT tell me where he was when we lived together. He did get a little better at texting me that he was going out, but mentioned that he didn't like that I ""controlled"" him by requiring he tell me if he was staying out for drinks.

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit, it started getting worse. He would go out two times a week, and stay out until the bars shut down. He would drive home drunk. One time, he even crashed his car because he was speeding and he was drunk driving home. Luckily, he didn't injure anyone or himself, but did 4K worth of damage to his car. I was so worried that he would get a DUI, that I started asking him to carpool to work (our offices were in very close proximity to each other). He would HATE when I asked to carpool. I honestly did it so that he would have to come home with me, or, if he decided to stay out, he would have to call me for a ride home.

&amp;#x200B;

A few times he came home so drunk (after driving) that he threw up. Once, he even defecated in his pants walking to his car (while drunk) to drive home. He showed up at 2:30am and showered and washed his underwear and pants.

&amp;#x200B;

I was getting very upset with this whole situation, and tried to talk to him. M isn't a very talkative-person. He's very reserved. He never talks about anything that is bothering him, he just holes it up inside. I would ask him to come home by 10 or 11pm after he was out drinking. He would agree, but then show up at 2am. Nothing I could say or do would make him come home. It was heartbreaking. I continuously came home to an empty house. At one point, I had a crockpot dinner cooking. I asked him to turn it off right when he got home at 6pm, as I was working late and he agreed. I show up to a burned dinner at 8pm. He never came home.

&amp;#x200B;

I attributed this behavior to not being happy up in our new city. I knew he missed his house and the former freedom he had with his other job. I felt guilty that I made him move up here, but at the same time, I didn't make the decision for him. I only encouraged him.

&amp;#x200B;

This behavior continued up until mid-July. We had been getting in small fights, and I had said that if he wasn't happy, he could leave. He mentioned that he would need about a month to find a place and I told him that if we were to separate he would have to leave immediately. He had a place to live in his city - his own house! He claimed he wouldn't want to commute from there, but I told him it was completely doable, as I did it for two years. He could handle it while he found another place.

&amp;#x200B;

After this fight, we agreed that things just got blown way out of proportion. I didn't think anything of it. Fast forward to mid-August of this year, and we talk about marriage. This was a topic we had spoken about multiple times, on many occasions. He says it's not in the cards. Nearly 6 years together, and it's not in the cards. He's said this all along, but he's faltered. He said he wasn't ever sure, because of what his father did (up and abandoned him and his mom), and I would always suggest therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Reddit, I know what you're going to say. He told me over the course of many years that he didn't know if he wanted to be married. I should have left then. However, I agreed to no wedding and possibly no marriage, but I did want kids. He said he potentially wanted kids. I was okay with that.

&amp;#x200B;

So, at this point in time, I've had enough of the exhausting nights of wondering whether or not he was going to come home to me. Wondering whether or not he'd get a DUI or I'd get a phone call from the police saying he was injured in a drunk-driving accident. I had had enough of the blatant disrespect. So, I asked him, ""do you just not want to get married at all, or do you not want to get married to me?"" He stated he didn't think he would ever want to be married, to anyone. I got upset and cried myself to sleep that night. I told him that he needed to go find what he was looking for in this life, and that I needed to find someone who shared the same values as I. He agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, we hug and decide to have an in-depth conversation about it after work. Guess what, Reddit. He doesn't come home. He completely avoids the conversation. I try to bring it up on some nights he is home, and he claims ""it's too close to bed time right now, we can't have this conversation,"" or ""why do you bring this up right now? I want to go to sleep."" For three weeks he avoided the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

However, about a month ago, I ask him what he envisions his future like within the next five years. He answers that he doesn't know. I ask him what city he sees himself living in, what he is doing career-wise, etc. and he still says he doesn't know. I mention to him that that is okay - sometimes you don't have a vision or are unsure of your plan. But, I did ask him ""even if you don't know what your future looks like, am I there in it?"" and he said he didn't know. I knew it was over at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I cried myself to sleep that night. He was right next to me and never even so much as tried to comfort me. I asked him how long he would need before he would be able to move out, and he said ""only about a week."" I genuinely didn't think too much of his response, because I figured he would go live at his house for the time being while he found a place. I know he had previously mentioned to me that he thought he would need about a month, but I figured he may just have wanted to be in his own place for a bit while he was looking for an apartment. I asked him to sleep on the couch that night. He actually ended up having to leave to go on a work trip for three days the following afternoon. I figured those three days would be good time spent away. Before I fell asleep that night, I texted two of my best friends and explained to them what happened. I asked that they come over my house the next day once M left for the airport.

&amp;#x200B;

Given that I had texted my friends late, they got back to me in the early morning hours, which woke me up. I noticed M's phone was on the nightstand, and, with him being downstairs, I decided to snoop. I had to know if there was any other girl, or anything else. His behavior just wasn't adding up, but I was too blind to see it.

&amp;#x200B;

What I found weren't any text messages from girls, but to realtors. He had been looking at apartments for over a month, on his lunch break, in the city. He had actually signed a lease, and it had begun three days beforehand. He never told me. In fact, to this day, I think he would have just come home from his trip and moved his stuff out without ever telling me. The timing for this couldn't have been any worse. I had just accepted a new job offer (still in the same city), and was set to begin my last week at my then-current job. I couldn't help but think that when he arrived back from his work trip, he *knew* it was my last week and that I'd be at the office finishing up my projects, and he would have just moved his stuff out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I woke him up a few hours later, and just asked him ""M, why did you sleep on the couch last night when you could have just gone to your apartment?"" and he asked how I knew. I admitted I went through his phone. Given what I had done was wrong per se, but Reddit, I am SO GLAD I found out on my own. I also found a ""favorite"" contact (for reference, we'll call her K). I googled her, and noticed she worked in the same building as M, K being on the operations side.I genuinely didn't think anything of it, I figured they worked together, they had to build out the new facility; it made total sense. I didn't confront him about that. All I confronted him in that moment was regarding how he could do something so hurtful as to sign a lease behind my back, without communicating with me. M stated that he signed the lease to ""cover himself,"" if in the case that I kicked him out and changed the locks. He said he didn't know how well the ""breakup"" would go, and that he did it to protect himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit, I was so hurt. How could he think that after nearly six years together I would treat him so poorly? How could he have been so cold and have lined up a place to live behind my back, full well knowing that he would be leaving without telling me? I think he is a coward.

&amp;#x200B;

Alas, the story doesn't end there, and I appreciate if and any of you readers are still with me. It helps writing these words down and being able to get these internal thoughts off my chest. M left for the airport, and my friends came over. One friend asked to see the e-mails, so I showed her the pictures I had taken of them. She noticed he had left his personal laptop available, so we logged into that. The first e-mail that popped up? Confirmation of a new account. Okay, sure, fine, I get it.

&amp;#x200B;

...But then we looked through the trash folder. What I found there crushed me even more. I found an email titled "":)"" and opened it. In it was a word document, written to K, that stated he had feelings for her. How she was so smart, beautiful, fun, etc. and how 'thinking about her makes his day better.' He mentioned how he would ""think about their first kiss, and what it would be like with her in his arms."" I still cannot get those sentences from the letter out of my head. I texted him one line from the letter. He knew I knew. He became defensive. I never asked, pleaded, begged, NOTHING. I have more self-respect than that. If someone doesn't want to be with you, you should never belittle yourself and beg for them. All I said to him was that he should have communicated how he was feeling in our relationship *before* writing that letter. He did mention in the letter how they went out one time. Hindsight is 20/20, and now all I can think about was how I was so trusting while he was out until 2am. I never asked who he was with or cared. I trusted him completely. He claims he never went out with K one-on-one and that when they did ""talk,"" it was in a group. I'm not sure if I buy that. I want to think he is telling the truth, but who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

Although that was the worst of it, I still found other things in the trash bin. I found receipts to ""Epoch.com"" for consistent payments of $55.00 every few days or so. I did a little bit of research... and to my dismay discovered that they were payments to pornography websites, but not just *any* pornography websites, the websites where you actually chat with cam girls. From January 2018 (the first trace receipt I found) until mid-August 2018, he had spent over $2,500 dollars just talking to these girls and tipping them! I found the chat history with some of the girls, and he consistently called them ""hun"" and ""babe."" *My nicknames.* He would ask them to do do grotesque asks and tip them if they did.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course now, I have to mention, our sex life had been non-existent for a while. I began taking anti-depressants back in 2016, and throughout most of 2017, I had little-to-no libido. However, I would say that in 2018 any time we did actually have sex, I was the one to initiate it. He never seemed interested in it, and when I asked him if our sex life bothered him, he claimed it didn't. Reddit, I gave him multiple platforms to express himself for this, but he just kept quiet.That's the basis behind our break-up, and I cannot feel I gave him an easy out telling him that we each needed to go find what we were looking for in life. However, once I found all this out, I just can't get over the fact that he was lining this up behind my back. There was no communication. I tried, Reddit, I really did. I tried to get him to talk to me about how he wasn't happy up in our new city. I expressed the fact that he may want to try therapy, etc., but he just shut down. I was okay with the breakup until I found all of these things he did behind my back: the lease, the cam girl chats, the letter to the coworker. I can't help but feel somehow *I* was broken-up *with*.A few other things I just want to get off my chest as to why I would second-guess myself if we ever did end up ""happily ever after:""

* **MONEY:**
* Oh, this is a doozy. Back at my first job (where we met), when I was making 40K a year with graduate school costs and a car payment, he made sure that I paid him half of the mortgage (700 dollars a month). I couldn't afford it, and I mentioned it to him on multiple occasions, but he insisted that if I wanted to live with him I'd have to pay it.
* When we first started living together (me in his house), I offered to pay for a few bills, totaling 100$. This lasted for a while, but then he came back and said he needed $400. I wasn't too happy that he just came out and said ""I need more money from you,"" instead of having a full on conversation about it. However, after about 6 months of paying the $400, he then claimed he needed half the mortgage, or $700. Mind you, he was making 85K at this point! I brought up the r/ personalfinance thread to him and suggested we pay the bills according to our salary percentages. Nope, that wasn't good enough. I sucked it up and paid.
* When I started my new job up in the city, I was making significantly more money. He asked that I pay more. I said that no, I wouldn't, **BUT**, what I would do is stash extra away in savings for when we wanted to buy our home together up in the city. He agreed. However, when I ended up purchasing the home on my own, I had saved approximately 15K over 1.5 years. He demanded that he get half. He claimed it was ""his money"" that I was saving. We got in a huge fight over that, and I think at one point he claimed he would break up over it. We ended up settling the argument in that I gave him 2K off the top. (Which would have made the past years' rent that I gave him approximately 1K versus $700). To this day I can't help but think he took advantage of me even though I made less than he did.
* He could NEVER save. That 2K I gave him? Gone. To this day, he still carries a balance of 5K in CC debt making 120K a year. I am an avid r/ personalfinance devotee. I think being financially sound is well worth the efforts.
* I recently asked him (mid-July) to start contributing to our bills in my home. He of course did have his bills still for his home, but without anyone living there, aside from the mortgage, the routine costs (e.g. water, heat, electric, etc.) were very cheap. Mine were doubling. I simply asked that he pay me $250 per month to help with the water bill and electric. He claimed he couldn't do it; that money was tight. We agreed to re-evaluate what he could pay me on September 1, and he said he could ""possibly only swing $100."" Guess what? We, as a couple, never made it to September 1, **and his lease started on August 16h. He knew he would never have to pay me a dime.** His reasoning for only wanting to give me $100? (while **still making 20% more than me at this point)** was that he wanted to *invest* some more money in tech stock. I reminded him that back in April 2017 when we filed our taxes (my tax attorney), he had **ten thousand dollars** to write off in losses because he kept day trading in biotech stock. He clearly never learned his lesson, but yet still wanted to put $300 dollars a month into stocks like Amazon.
* **HIS MOM:** she hated me. I was never good enough for her son. Nothing I did was good enough. She babied the hell out of him; hence why I think he genuinely needs more of a mom than a girlfriend.
* **RESPONSIBILITIES:**
* We decided to adopt a little fur baby in October of 2016. (His idea, actually). I picked out the cat, but we were invested in the decision together. I would consistently have to ask him to feed her. I took care of her 90% of the time, but say, if I hadn't fed her before bed and we were both upstairs, I would ask him and he would say ""no, you go do it. Do not ask me when I'm already up in bed."" 
* He would NEVER cook. Not once. Even with my long 4-hour-a-day commute I never came home to a nice meal on the table. He always berated me for how I never cooked. I'll admit, that in the last year, I honestly haven't cooked that much because I did it to spite him. He was fully capable of making himself dinner, but always wanted me to do it. Truth be told, he was out at the bar 2+ nights a week so if I wasn't hungry, I just didn't make anything. I hated that I would make dinner and he wouldn't even text me to tell me he wasn't coming home.
* Laundry was 100% me. Folding, putting clothes away, etc. He could have helped with that part, but every time he would wash something of mine it would end up ruined. I was okay with doing 100% of the washing, but I could have used help when it came time to fold. He claimed ""washing was the easy part"" and that if I was taking that on as my main chore, I should fold and put it away too. (He did help on some rare occasions though).
* He would flat-out refuse to ever clean the bathroom. Never did it once. He used so much hairspray (way more than even any woman I know), and I was so sick of the sticky film it would leave. I would ask him to clean it up and he never would. I would end up doing it because it bothered me so much.
* **FUTURE CHILDREN:** he was relatively unsure if he wanted kids, but a huge red flag was that the mentioned he didn't want to change diapers, and that the child rearing was ""80% the mom and 20% the dad"". He mentioned he would ""be there"" to help raise the child, but it was primarily my responsibility. 

Reddit, there is so much more. My thoughts are probably all jumbled up and may not make much sense, but these are the key highlights. Of course, I'm not telling you all the nice little things he's done for me, I'm just highlighting the bad things. Truth be told though, in the last three years he's never gone out of his way to show me he cares. No surprises, no small little things like waking up to get me coffee. I would do small things here and there for him, but when these actions aren't being reciprocated, it's very hard to keep doing them for someone who doesn't seem to appreciate you.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't say I was the best girlfriend either, I suffer from severe OCD and can be difficult to handle at times. However, my loyalty never waivered and I definitely don't believe I deserved the amount of disrespect he showed me. Even when he came to pick up all of his belongings a while ago, he claimed what he did wasn't disrespectful. He couldn't see how it was.Thank you all for reading. I don't know why, but I felt that I just needed to get this out. To me, seeing and reading that letter to the coworker was very eye-opening. I never thought that he'd find someone else or develop a crush and not tell me. He claims he never cheated, but there was even a trip he took back in 2015  (two years into our relationship) in which pictures with a girl surfaced and my gut told me (even at the time) that something happened...

&amp;#x200B;

M put more thought into that letter he wrote to his coworker than he did the last two years in our relationship... I am broken right now, but I know I will heal with time. I know I made the right decision in breaking up due to our fundamental differences, but I can't help but feel lonely and undesirable at the moment. It hurts knowing when someone fell out of love with you didn't have the gall to step forward and communicate. M is the epitome of cowardice. ""What's done in the dark will be brought to the light,"" and ""the grass is greenest wherever you water it."" Those are two of my favorite phrases, and they still stand true to this moment. Thank you all for reading, I appreciate it more than you could know.

TL;DR: I broke up with my boyfriend because we both seemed to want different things in life. However, I found out he signed a lease to an apartment behind my back (after living together for five years), and wrote a love letter to a coworker. He made me think I was in control of the breakup, and although I did initiate it, I still can't help but feel like I was broken up with. His behavior over the past year or so was so disrespectful to me, and yet I can't help but miss him and want him back. I know I could never trust him again, but I need to get this off my chest."

9lglpu,2,2018-10-04,Do you have experience with Katalon Studio or similar *Free* automation programs? I have a VERY simply problem thats becoming a HUGE headache,Unemployedgrad88,Automate,https://www.reddit.com/r/Automate/comments/9lglpu/do_you_have_experience_with_katalon_studio_or/,"Just downloaded Katalon Studio. I am tasked with converting the old wiki to the new wiki.

&amp;#x200B;

The easiest and most painless way is to download all the old wiki pages in word doc, and import to the new wiki.. It keeps 90% of the new formatting, the interns can clean up the rest.   


I have an excel spreadsheet with 2000 links to pages we want to keep.

&amp;#x200B;

the process is as follows:

With spreadsheet already open, click links in succession from 1 to number 2000.

When the hyperlink URL opens to the wiki click the \*\*\* on the top right hand corner and click ""Export to Word""

&amp;#x200B;

I will worry about the import after I get all 2000 links downloaded.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know Katalon very well and I have zero python or coding experience, what is the least painful way to do this? Katalon seems very responsive for anything contained within a browser, but it seems to fall apart when clicking from the google docs spreadsheet, opening the hyperlink to the Wiki and clicking \*\*\* in order to ""Export to Word"".. It doesnt like the switching back and forth..  


Is there a way I can have Katalon troll the spreadsheet, either using google spreadsheet or importing the entire .xsl to Katalon and having it work thru the data..  


What am I doing wrong, or how can I do it better, what Features of Katalon am I not using??  


  
\*\*\*As a caveat... for those who want to use the HTML code and get a Dev to write a python script, everything is behind a firewall which requires and ID card reader and Pin, so it must be automated from inside the firewall (which Katalon seems to be able to do from my testing.)"

I'm a recent marketing undergraduate. I've had trouble finding work, until I recently landed an internship (with potential for full employment) with a PR company. And so far it's been great.

But, my studies were focused less on PR, so I feel as though I may not be aware of some pretty basic PR know how. I've already experienced how my education in marketing has been valuable, but I don't want that to justify lacking in other areas.

What skills would you feel a marketer might lack or be unaware of when starting and getting into the depths of PR practice?

I'm quite enjoying it, as it's my own preferred method of learning about a company/product as opposed to advertisements. It also allows for more variety in both what I'm working with and the problems that im asked to solve. It's great, and I'm not eager to mess it up.

My thanks for any input!"
9lh4ir,288,2018-10-04,"The time my mother stole my birthday flowers, but I was totally the bad guy",PoqaMacha,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9lh4ir/the_time_my_mother_stole_my_birthday_flowers_but/,"First, I want to thank everyone who responded to my last post several months ago. I was dealing with a lot and didn't have it in me to respond, but believe me when I say I am grateful for all of the support. I am still grieving the loss of my grandpa because he was the best father figure I ever had.

Right now, I have minimal contact with my mother. When she texts, I answer cordially but I don't make an effort to carry on a conversation (and neither does she). I have not yet pursued taking over on my student loans. I know it is an option if it absolutely must happen, but I am trying to hold out until I either pay off my car (2 more years) or find a new job. I would like to avoid accruing more interest.

I have an older story for all of you today. This happened back when I was in my final year of college. I was a full time student with a part time job and an unpaid internship. Basically, I was super busy all the time.

My boyfriend at the time (I'll call him ex for the sake of simplicity) decided he wanted to send me flowers for my birthday, since I was so stressed and since I actually had my first office with my internship. They were really nice flowers in a vase I really liked. I was afraid the flowers would die quicker in my windowless office, so I thought it would be better to take them home. I remember trying my best not to make any sudden stops or turns so the vase wouldn't fall over. It was a stressful half hour drive home, but the flowers made it relatively unscathed!

At that time, I still lived with my parents. My bedroom was in the basement and barely got any sunlight. I thought it would be best to leave the flowers in the kitchen where it was nice and sunny. My parents were the only other ones living there and they never had flowers around, so I thought it would be nice.

Literally a day later, I came home from work and went into the kitchen to get something to eat when I noticed the flowers were gone. I went to ask my parents what had happened, and my mother explained she had taken them to her work WITHOUT ASKING ME.

""Oh well no one really sees them in here, so I thought they would be better at my office where more people can enjoy them.""

My mother is never wrong, according to her. She does not apologize. If something is wrong, it is someone else's fault. So when I started getting upset that she had taken MY birthday flowers, she got mad at me.

""Just get over it!""

My dad was there, too. And do you know what he did? He took her side. He jumped aboard the ""get over it"" train.

They sent me out to go get them dinner at some fast food place. I was crying while I drove, and I called ex to tell him what had happened. He was furious.

When I got home and they saw I had been crying, they had apparently forgotten what they had done. My mother asked what was wrong, and I told her that she had stolen my birthday flowers.

She got red in the face, did a weird flailing gesture, and shrieked ""GET OVER IT!""

That was one time I got mad back at her. ""You asked me what was wrong, and I am telling you!"" She just stormed back off to their room to smoke more pot and eat her greasy food.

After I had calmed down, I asked her to please bring them back the next time she was at work. ""If you want them so bad, YOU can go get them.""

When I asked her just to bring my vase home, ""Get it yourself.""

This woman made me drive across town to get my birthday present that she stole and refused to acknowledge. She would not budge. Eventually, I just had ex do it because I didn't want to have to deal with her when we picked it up. She maintained that this was all somehow my fault, and how dare I get upset at anything she ever did.

That wasn't even the first birthday she had ruined, either. My first birthday in college, I was upset because I wanted a homemade cake and not a store bought one because I didn't like the icing. While we were in the store, my mother got furious because of this. She started storming away from me so I practically had to jog to keep up with her, then she started complaining about what I had gotten her for mother's day that year and how I clearly didn't love her. My birthday is several months AFTER mother's day, so that was really out of left field for me.

In general, whenever she would half-ass something for my birthday, I was never grateful enough for her liking. I was always horrible, and she would always say she would never do anything for my birthday ever again. Because of that, I now hate anything to do with my birthday and go out of my way to avoid attention.

And yet she is allowed -- justified, even -- to be ungrateful when I give her literally anything. Cool.

Sorry for the rant. I just needed to get this off my chest. I want to post more about my mother, but I don't really want to give her a nickname. In my mind, that would be giving her too much power. Am I the only one who thinks this way?

Thanks for reading!"
9lhdu4,1,2018-10-04,M4F- The Intern Affair. (Rough Idea),Soupandsaladbarfan,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9lhdu4/m4f_the_intern_affair_rough_idea/,"I would love to play out a scene where you are an intern at my company; its not a well paying job, but its in the field you want so you take what you can get. Despite the low pay, you always seem to be dressed better then the other interns and you are open about not coming from money. During your nights you make the vast majority of your money as an escort, its not something you are proud of, but you have your fun and your clients treat you well. 

I would be rich, married and the last person that anyone would expect to cheat on their wife. You've met her a few times as shes come to the office and you've seen how we interact as she perfectly placed by my side. You do have a bit of a crush on me as you do like older men, but push it aside to remain professional.

The scene would start with your arrival at a room for a new client, which of course be me. Would love to explore your submission to not only a client you are attracted to, but to your boss that could ruin your job and to a potential sugar daddy if you are worth what the escort company charges. 

I wouldn't know who I was getting until I open the door so it would be a surprise to us both. But if you are willing we can explore my marriage and how you would fit in after our initial night together.

9li9bl,3,2018-10-04,F4M: “Debauchery with Hank and YoYo”,Funblondie,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9li9bl/f4m_debauchery_with_hank_and_yoyo/,"“What the fuck is upppppp!” He said in his deep intense voice.  “Good morning and welcome back, all you fucking degenerates. And if you aren’t a degenerate, you probably have the wrong station, so gettttt the fuck outta here,” Hank continued as he waved his hand across his body as if throwing someone out of an event.

“Hank is amped up this morning as you all can tell. And I’m YoYo. You’re listening to Debauchery.  The number one Sirius radio show in the country,” his partner laughed, talking into his microphone. 

“Old big dick over there. What’s up brother, how was the weekend?”

It’s true what YoYo said. Debauchery was the number one show on Sirius radio.  It had blown up over the past two years that HBO picked it up to air on their channel on weekday mornings live from 6:30 - 11:30.  The week usually started off slow, every morning did to an extent.  But not this morning.

“Spent some time with the kid.” YoYo replied, his real name Pete Dranklin, but the childhood nickname having stuck all these years.  “Watched the Cowboys fucking suck again.  I mean what a disgrace they are.”

“That’s why fuck kids man. Any of you younger listeners out there. You fucking college kids that run around with your super sperm. Fuck condoms. Just get a damn vasectomy now. Don’t fuck around and screw up your life-“ 

That’s when I walked in.  The mess that I was. The hot blonde 21 year old intern producer and booking agent for the show. “And here is ladies and gentlemen, the ass that motivates us to come in here in the morning and the reason all you lazy jobless sacks of shit sit on your sofa each morning and watch this show while you beat your meat.”

YoYo chimed in,  “And you’re looking extra fucked up this morning, aren’t you Kelsey.”  I replied to that with the middle finger and a laugh.  “Screw off.” 

“Stopping here on your way home of a walk of shame?”

“Oh leggings and a top are suddenly not appropriate here?” I look at him acting puzzled.

I was used to this whole act.  I tried to play things up for the audience and I actually got along with the guys really well.  They treated me good.

“Alright, Alright Kels...Tell us what you’ve planned us for the week.”

“Okay let’s see...we have a good guests this week.  Nothing today. But tomorrow we have Hank Azaria in studio, then Terry Crews. And possibly a call in from Aziz Ansari.” I continue scanning my notes.  

“Wednesday....porn star Nikki Benz, rapper Ludacris and Cuba Golding Jr.  well Cuba will be Skyping in. Thursday is a couple golfers I guess?” I shrug.  “I don’t remember their names.  And...Friday, Dan Bilzerian, Kevin Federline, and I’m working on Danny Devito but he has not been confirmed yet.”

(I’m going to stop there and let us continue playing this out together!! I don’t think it will lead to sex on the air but a lot of sex conversations! Maybe offering guys to call up and tell stories, ask questions of me, and have me do some dirty things.  Maybe contests with me vs other girls? Hank is probably been divorced 3 times already and has a couple sexual harassment allegations against him :) 

We can play out and me and him after shows or me in my dating life with fans of the show, or a combination!) "
9liiy3,1,2018-10-04,M4F Cuckolding Your Husband With A Boy Stud A Third Your Age,freeusestud,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9liiy3/m4f_cuckolding_your_husband_with_a_boy_stud_a/,"This is a prompt directed at all the women of dpp who are a little more experienced. By that I mean, you’re not the tight assed college coed you used to be. You’ve been married for a while now, and have the stretch marks and slightly sagging ass to prove it.   
     
Things weren’t always this way. You can remember a time when just walking through the door used to give your husband a hard on. He used to come up behind you as you rummaged through a drawer, and press his crotch against your ass as he reached around to mash your tits together. 

Send back then was more fulfilling. I mean, you used to look at yourself in the mirror as you fucked and think  l*damn, we could be pornstars* as you watched your husbands firm muscular back move as he plunged his throbbing 26 year old cock inside you. 

But things have changed. Your tight toned thighs are less so, having never really gotten back into shape after the first kid. Instead of coming up behind you to grab a feel, he’s tapping you on the shoulder to ask where the tums are, his heartburn getting the better of him. 


On the rare occasion you do have sex, he’s always tired, and it’s a quick sorry affair. After he pulls out of you, ten strokes after entering, you lay back and sigh, unsatisfied, with his cock barely doing much more than get you frustrated. You might even sneak off to the bathroom to play with someone who’s become a friend over the years: your detachable showerhead. 


Now that the kids are all off in college, it’s even worse. You either putter about an empty house, or come home from work to a house with just you and your husband, with him asking you for help putting in his new anti fungal cream. 

But one day, that changes. Maybe it’s the new neighbor, a 16 year old boy living off a trust fund. Or the high school intern at your corporate office.  Or maybe even a new trainer at the gym, the young junior quarterback. You joined a year ago, hoping that you getting back into shape would spark something in hubby, but nothing. He barely acknowledges your new, tighter abs, or realizes that your ass is firmer than it’s been in years. 

But this new man, he notices. You start to feel deja vu when he looks at you. The desire in his eyes reminiscent of earlier days, when you could walk down the street and know that every man in sight was looking at you like that. 


So, that’s my idea. To be clear, I’m not looking for a one off wham bam thank you ma’am here. I want to build a story. You aren’t going to throw twenty years of marriage away for a quick fling, you’re going to make me work for it. Maybe at first we have a frantic make out in the janitors closet, or the gym after hours. But slowly I’ll wear you down. You’ll end up coming to the gym, knowing that as soon as everyone else leaves, you’ll be peeling down your tight yoga pants as I dive between your sweaty legs and lap away at your musky pussy. Or getting on your knees beneath your own fancy oak desk and trying to get your nose to push against my pubes as you deep throat my cock. A cock, by the way, that is bigger than your husbands ever was. 

Then the clincher. The day you invite me to your house. I show up around noon, and make my way up to your room. You’re sitting in your bed in a lace negligee, laying out on satin sheets as I enter. We spend hours making wild love, interspersed with slow, passionate sex, the kind where we look into each other’s eyes and cum together, in a wave of physical and emotional pleasure. 


The time passes by without us noticing, that’s how engrossed we are with each other’s bodies. It happens during a particularly animalistic session, the fourth time we’ve fucked that day. I have you pressed against the wall, your legs wrapped around my back as I bounce you on my cock, your pussy juices, mixed with the previous loads I’ve left inside you, running out of your pussy down my balls. Your husband walks in, horror etched in his face. Instead of you jumping back and crying excuses, you tell me to go ahead, which I do. In front of your horrified husband, I come deep inside you. My balls clench as I blow my hot potent load inside you, overflowing your gash. 

Well then, I had a lot of fun writing that. If you sympathize with this character, or just like the idea, I’d love to see if we can work out some sort of roleplay together. I can’t wait to see your messages. "

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

How to repair used common projects, look nice, and save the environment.",throwawayBeachball1,frugalmalefashion,https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/9lk9bq/the_college_studentspoor_mansfrugal_guide_to/,"###Hi guys just wanted to give back to this great community I love. What I'll be showing is how to get a pretty nice pair of common projects for a really affordable price. Like about $130-$160 total. We can do this by restoring a slightly beat pair of CPs 

#Introduction 


To give a bit of context, I'm a final year student at college. I study computer science at a really good program so I've some extra cash from internships to spend on clothes because I love fashion after all expenses are paid. Add on to that I LOVE LOVE LOVE white shoes [proof](https://imgur.com/zOGaQpg) so my grails have always been a pair of white common projects archilles. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you've been on here enough you'll see that common projects sales are really popular. However, the lowest I've ever seen a pair of archilles are $260 shipped. If you're really really patient on grailed or ebay or on the buy/sell/trade threads you can find a nice used one for around $200-$220, in size 41 because that's my size. But even these prices are too much for me.

&amp;nbsp;

Some people might say that why don't you try a CP alternative. I did, got the beckett simonon albas - bottom left in the proof photo - but they're not the same quality leather, comfort and look despite some claiming that they close because they are made in the same factory and have the same soles. 

&amp;nbsp;

So recently I got a job as a research assistant and have some cash coming it, almost could cop the CPs on sale but a sale was not appearing. Also have always been worried about fashion's environmental impacts and have been buying only used clothing for the past year. But I've never bought used shoes so this was a first. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are actually no tutorials on the internet about how to restore white leather sneakers, closest I found were one on stan smiths and stan smiths are definitely not common project level. So I took a combination of sneaker restoration and dress shoe restoration.

#Restoration Tutorial

These are the shoes I've bought on grailed. [A common project Archilles retro in size 41](https://imgur.com/a/5xqwMPk). The condition when they arrived were actually a bit worse than in the pictures because its not shown but the entire left back of the right shoe had its paint taken off. I bought the retros because the lows were too tight for me, tried on a friend's pair and a wide foot user once posted on MFA about how the retros are a good fit for him so I got a pair of retros.

&amp;nbsp;

##step 1 clean the shoes

[Supplies](https://zerothcat.imgur.com/all/) 

&amp;nbsp;

* old toothbrush
* cold water
* soap/shoe cleaner. I used angelus 
* rag. I used microfiber because it dries the water up so nice
* prop to contain shape of shoe. I used a shoetree but I think that rags or newspaper can do.
* optional. Magic eraser for possible sole cleanup

&amp;nbsp;

Unlace your common projects and prop it tight with either a shoe tree, news paper or maybe socks or towel. Mix the clean solution and cold water in a bucket. Dip your toothbrush in and gently brush your common projects. Let it dry for 10 minutes 


##step 2 repair deep scars 

[supplies](https://imgur.com/E4zLhE4) 

&amp;nbsp;

* q tips
* angelus white leather paint 

&amp;nbsp;

Disclaimer: the shoe in the picture guide are pretty well repaired. Sorry I didn't take pictures of the shoe while I was doing the repair the first time.

&amp;nbsp;

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND USING THE PAINT NEAR THE GOLD LETTERING. STEP 3 WILL SHOW HOW TO REPAIR THAT AREA

[Picture guide](https://imgur.com/a/4P91BVZ)

&amp;nbsp;

Take your q tip and dip one end into the paint. Find a place where the paint is heavily chip or missing and put some paint on the area. Take the other end of the q tip, the dry end, and mix the a paint onto the area. Let it dry for 1 minute, you can repeat this process several times to take away the deep chips in paint.

&amp;nbsp;

##step 3 repair light scuffs and better the shoe 

[supplies](https://imgur.com/snLNULo) 

&amp;nbsp;

* white shoe cream
* fingers

&amp;nbsp;

[Picture guide](https://imgur.com/a/GiX3nAy)

Open your jar of white shoe cream. Got my from amazon. Dip your finger into the cream and put a bit of it on the shoe's scuffed area. Rub the cream gently in with your fingers. I actually used the cream on the entire shoe, I would really recommend doing that. Also go over the gold lettering with a q-tip dipped in water after this to remove the shoe cream from making the gold lettering dull.

##step 4 condition the entire shoe

[supplies](https://imgur.com/9oD6uEr) 

&amp;nbsp;

* Leather conditioner. I bought saphir leather balm from amazon because I read that nice dress shoes use it. 
* fingers 

&amp;nbsp;

[Picture guide](https://imgur.com/a/GiX3nAy)

&amp;nbsp;

Dip your fingers into the leather conditioner. Put it over the entire shoe and rub it in with your fingers. Let it dry


&amp;nbsp;


#Conclusion 


&amp;nbsp;

That's actually it my fam. Not a lot of work, about 50 minutes total for the two shoes and the results are pretty good. 


&amp;nbsp;

Cost


&amp;nbsp;

* Shoe cleaner. ($5) Got it a long time ago as a part of a kit but I think standalone its like  5 bucks
* Angelus paint. ($5.7) Bought from Amazon and got the 1 oz bottle
* Shoe cream. ($6.7) Bought from Amazon
* Saphir leather balm. ($12) Saw a lot of people use it on Allen edmonds and they say that its the best in the world. So its a bit pricey. 1.7 oz bottle
* fingers. Priceless because I need them to code. 

&amp;nbsp;

So the total cost of sneakers + shoe cleaner + angelus paint + shoe cream + saphir balm = $152.4

&amp;nbsp;

[FINAL RESULTS](https://imgur.com/a/7s0AQD2)

&amp;nbsp;


I was really lucky with the shoes because I posted in I think r/sneakermarket and the guy gave me a good deal because he remembers trying to cop while in college on a thin budget. I really hope that this guide helped my fellow college students to at least have another option besides buying common projects on sale. Also hoped to maybe show some shoe restoration stuff so we don't throw away our shoes so often and save the environment. 

 
&amp;nbsp;

I think I paid about $130 for my beckett simonon alba sneakers when they were on sale. I would much prefer these used CPs over them because CPs are so much more comfortable and look IMO much much nicer and thinner. I think used common projects in a less desirable condition can be bought for around $120-$130 for popular sizes on grailed, for bigger or smaller sizes I think they can even go to $100. Hopefully this was helpful to you guys!!!"

Add on to that I LOVE LOVE LOVE white shoes [proof](https://imgur.com/zOGaQpg) so my grails have always been a pair of white common projects archilles. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you follow r/frugalmalefashion you'll see that common projects sales are really popular. However, the lowest I've ever seen a pair of archilles are $260 shipped. If you're really really patient on grailed or ebay or on the buy/sell/trade threads you can find a nice used one for around $200-$220, in size 41 because that's my size. But even these prices are too much for me.

&amp;nbsp;

Some people might say that why don't you try a CP alternative. I did, got the beckett simonon reids - bottom left in the proof photo - but they're not the same quality leather, comfort and look despite some claiming that they close because they are made in the same factory and have the same soles. 

&amp;nbsp;

So recently I got a job as a research assistant and have some cash coming in, almost could cop the CPs on sale but a sale was not appearing. Also have always been worried about fashion's environmental impacts and have been buying only used clothing for the past year. But I've never bought used shoes so this was a first. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are actually no tutorials on the internet about how to restore white leather sneakers, closest I found were one on stan smiths and stan smiths are definitely not common project level. So I took a combination of sneaker restoration and dress shoe restoration.

#Restoration Tutorial

These are the shoes I've bought on grailed. [A common project Archilles retro in size 41](https://imgur.com/a/5xqwMPk). The condition when they arrived were actually a bit worse than in the pictures because its not shown but the entire left back of the right shoe had its paint taken off. I bought the retros because the lows were too tight for me, tried on a friend's pair and a wide foot user once posted on MFA about how the retros are a good fit for him so I got a pair of retros.

&amp;nbsp;

##step 1 clean the shoes

[Supplies](https://imgur.com/PfnMOwR) 

&amp;nbsp;

* old toothbrush
* cold water
* soap/shoe cleaner. I used angelus 
* rag. I used microfiber because it dries the water up so nice
* prop to contain shape of shoe. I used a shoetree but I think that rags or newspaper can do.
* optional. Magic eraser for possible sole cleanup

&amp;nbsp;

Unlace your common projects and prop it tight with either a shoe tree, news paper or maybe socks or towel. Mix the clean solution and cold water in a bucket. Dip your toothbrush in and gently brush your common projects. Let it dry for 10 minutes 


##step 2 repair deep scars 

[supplies](https://imgur.com/E4zLhE4) 

&amp;nbsp;

* q tips
* angelus white leather paint 

&amp;nbsp;

Disclaimer: the shoe in the picture guide are pretty well repaired. Sorry I didn't take pictures of the shoe while I was doing the repair the first time.

&amp;nbsp;

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND USING THE PAINT NEAR THE GOLD LETTERING. STEP 3 WILL SHOW HOW TO REPAIR THAT AREA

[Picture guide](https://imgur.com/a/4P91BVZ)

&amp;nbsp;

Take your q tip and dip one end into the paint. Find a place where the paint is heavily chip or missing and put some paint on the area. Take the other end of the q tip, the dry end, and mix the paint onto the area. Let it dry for 1 minute, you can repeat this process several times to take away the deep chips in paint.

&amp;nbsp;

##step 3 repair light scuffs and better the shoe 

[supplies](https://imgur.com/snLNULo) 

&amp;nbsp;

* white shoe cream
* fingers

&amp;nbsp;

[Picture guide](https://imgur.com/a/GiX3nAy)

Open your jar of white shoe cream. Got mine from amazon. Dip your finger into the cream and put a bit of it on the shoe's scuffed area. Rub the cream gently in with your fingers. I actually used the cream on the entire shoe, I would really recommend doing that. Also go over the gold lettering with a q-tip dipped in water after this to remove the shoe cream from making the gold lettering dull.

##step 4 condition the entire shoe

[supplies](https://imgur.com/9oD6uEr) 

&amp;nbsp;

* Leather conditioner. I bought saphir leather balm from amazon because I read that nice dress shoes use it. 
* fingers 

&amp;nbsp;

[Picture guide](https://imgur.com/a/xlYDA32)

&amp;nbsp;

Dip your fingers into the leather conditioner. Put it over the entire shoe and rub it in with your fingers. Let it dry


&amp;nbsp;


#Conclusion 


&amp;nbsp;

That's actually it my fam. Not a lot of work, about 50 minutes total for the two shoes and the results are pretty good. 


&amp;nbsp;

Cost


&amp;nbsp;

* Shoe cleaner. ($5) Got it a long time ago as a part of a kit but I think standalone its like  5 bucks
* Angelus paint. ($5.7) Bought from Amazon and got the 1 oz bottle
* Shoe cream. ($6.7) Bought from Amazon
* Saphir leather balm. ($12) Saw a lot of people use it on Allen edmonds and they say that its the best in the world. So its a bit pricey. 1.7 oz bottle
* fingers. Priceless because I need them to code. 

&amp;nbsp;

So the total cost of sneakers + shoe cleaner + angelus paint + shoe cream + saphir balm = $152.4

&amp;nbsp;

[FINAL RESULTS](https://imgur.com/a/7s0AQD2)

&amp;nbsp;


I was really lucky with the shoes because I posted in I think r/sneakermarket and the guy gave me a good deal because he remembers trying to cop while in college on a thin budget. I really hope that this guide helped my fellow college students to at least have another option besides buying common projects on sale. Also hoped to maybe show some shoe restoration stuff so we don't throw away our shoes so often and save the environment. 

 
&amp;nbsp;

I think I paid about $130 for my beckett simonon alba sneakers when they were on sale. I would much prefer these used CPs over them because CPs are so much more comfortable and look IMO much much nicer and thinner. I think used common projects in a less desirable condition can be bought for around $120-$130 for popular sizes on grailed, for bigger or smaller sizes I think they can even go to $100. Hopefully this was helpful to you guys!!!

EDIT: aight guys just realized that the Beckett simonons I purchased were not the albas but the reids. [proof](https://imgur.com/OUJyA4C). 

###EDIT2: Aight fam, for those that were wondering if Beckett Simonons were a good CP alternative. I just made a post detailing why I think Beckett simonons are a shit CP alternative. Give it a read if you're contemplating buying Beckett simonons as an affordable alternative to CPs.

In my contract which I signed when I first finished my internship it had a job title from two iterations ago and a totally different wage, it also states I need to give three months notice after working here as long as I have. An intern is being hired to my department to help spread the load but I have no interest in staying even that long. Were I to get a new job and immediately leave (interview upcoming) is that appropriate as in the absence of a full written contract which is up to date I see the advice from HR as a verbal contract which we've gone over several times.

The delicate issue is that no one here knows half of what I do, that i'm looking to move on or even the tools I use day-to-day so were I to leave with no notice period it could cause nightmare issues but I seem to be legally obligated not to work a notice period despite my original contract and I'm definitely not inclined otherwise!"

Also after first licensing, they will certainly need to be reassessed  every 2 years or two to continue to function as drug store dispensers.

:-:|
The Eagles head back to the friendly confines of Lincoln Financial Field where they have won 13 out of 14 with the one lose coming in the season finale last season where they Eagles rested many starters. The Eagles are looking to rebound in a tough OT loss against the Tennessee Titans in Nashville. The task will not be easy as they welcome the Minnesota Vikings to town for a rematch of last season’s NFC Championship Game. The game will have a different look this season as the Eagles have starter Carson Wentz back at the helm and the Vikings have 84 million dollar man Kirk Cousins from the division Rival Washington Redskins (not to be confused with Kurt Cousins, who also played for the Redskins.) The Eagles have familiarity with Cousins, facing him twice a year the last few seasons. Cousins owns a 4-3 record against the Eagles, but the Eagles had his number of late winning the last two games and forcing Cousins to turn the ball over 4 times. The Eagles defense will look to force some turnover in this game, a category they excelled in last season, but have struggled with this year where they are -3 in turnover differential. To flip that around the Eagles will also have to protect the ball better, multiple fumbles this season at key points have had the Eagles shooting themselves in the foot. Part of those fumbles have come from the Eagles inability to protect the QB this season both by the offensive line and running backs. The Eagles need to be better this week against a talented defense that flies to the football and also looks to cause turnovers and get the ball back to their high scoring offense. Cousins has a multitude of weapons at his disposal with two great WRS, a talented young running back and veteran TE. The Vikings offense is called by a familiar face in former Eagles QB coach John DeFlippo, who the Eagles offense is missing along with OC Frank Reich. Many offensive categories that the Eagles exceled in last year, they are struggling in this season: PPG the Eagles ranked 3rd in 2017, this year they are 26th, 2017 YPG 7th, 2018 YPG 20th.  The Eagles need to right the ship on offense this week or they could be in for a long season, but it won’t be easy against a very talented Minnesota team who is looking for revenge for the NFC Championship Game.|

Eagles 38 - Vikings 7|
The Eagles were underdogs heading into the NFC Championship after taking care the Falcons in the NFC Divisional Round. The Vikings took a quick lead scoring on their opening possession and forced a quick 3 and out. After that it was all Eagles. Chris Long hit Case Keenum's arm forcing an errant pass that Patrick Robinson took the other way for a 50 yard pick six. The Eagles defense forced 3 and out on the next possession as Nick Foles lead the Eagles 75 yards down the field against the league's number one defense before LaGarrett Blount barreled his way in the endzone for his 10th post season TD. The Eagles defense came up big in the second quarter as the Vikings were threatening to put points on the board before Derek Barnett sacked Case Keenum and forced a fumble recovered by Chris Long. Foles found Jeffery on the following drive for 53 yards and the TD. The Eagles would tack on 3 more points at the end of the half as they got the ball with just 29 seconds left and quickly moved down the field and set up a 53 yard Jake Elliott FG. Doug Pederson pulled out some razzle dazzle to open the second half as he called for a flea flicker which resulted in a 41 yard Torrey Smith TD. Foles would throw his 3rd TD pass of the game and 2nd to Alshon Jeffery to start the 4th quarter, in what ended up being 38 unanswered points, 31 by the offense against the league top defense. The Eagles defense would hold the Vikings scoreless after the opening possession and hold on to the win and send the Eagles to their third Super Bowl.|

Recap from Last Week’s Games.|
:-
**Eagles** - [Video](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000000968316/Eagles-vs-Titans-highlights-Week-4) The Eagles traveled to Nashville to take on the Tennessee Titans where the offense struggled despite the return of Alshon Jeffery. On the offensive side of the football the Eagles struggled with drops throughout the day from their WRs particularly Nelson Agholor and Jordan Matthews. In the trenches it wasn't much better as the OL consistently failed to pick up stunts while the RBs failed miserably to pick up the well designed blitzes as Wentz was sacked 4 times. The other side of the ball wasn't much better as the Eagles D continued to struggle away from the comfy confines of the Linc. DC Jim Schwartz consistently ran inverted Tampa 2 which Mariota had no problems torching on his way to 344 yards and 2 TDs, his failure to adjust put the Eagles DBs in poor positions they were not accustomed to and ultimately hurt the defense especially in OT where the Eagles game up 3 first downs on first downs to lose the game with a late FG and 26 seconds to go in the game.|
**Vikings** - [Video](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000000967283/Vikings-vs-Rams-highlights-Week-4) – The Vikings traveled to LA to take on the Rams on Thursday Night Football. The game quickly turned into a shootout with the two teams exchanging blows before Goff hit Cooks with 1:26 to go in the first half to put the Rams up by 11, 28-17. The Vikings were able to add a FG at the end of the half to bring it within 8. The Vikings got it within 3 on after their first possession, but the Rams offense quickly answered and their defensive line began to takes its toll and get to Cousins sacking him multiple times. The scoring tapered off in the 4th with the Vikings adding FG with under 5 minutes to go in the game, but the Rams D held on for the win 38-31.|

**Matchups to Watch**|
:--|
**Eagles Secondary vs. Vikings Pass Offense**|
Against a struggling pass offense with inferior receivers compared to the group entering The Linc on Sunday, this Eagles secondary was lit up by Marcus Mariota and Company in a shocking OT loss. I detailed last week the possibility that this could happen given the inferior talent at CB (Mills), an inconsistent player overall (Darby), and the loss of McLeod. The Eagles are already a much worse pass defense on the road than at home and continue to get burned by the same issues that have plagued them at times under Schwartz. Furthermore, the coaching staff didn't do nearly enough to put its players in positions to succeed last week. It'll be up to them to right the ship before the season gets out of hand. That is no small task considering the Eagles don't have McLeod and have a talented matchup this Sunday in the Vikings who are looking to right their own mess and get revenge for the NFCCG. If you are an opposing OC, why would you not throw at Mills until he stops you? Darby had a great week 1 but has been largely poor since, throw at him too. Being able to win through the air is one of the most efficient ways to win in the NFL and it'll be imperative for the Eagles to do their jobs on the back end this Sunday to correct the course of their season. John DeFilippo knows the Eagles personnel well as does Kirk Cousins. Kirk has been as good as the Vikings have needed him to be on the early season completing nearly 70% of his passes. It helps that he has two great receivers in Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs. Both receivers are excellent against man and zone coverages. They are also two of the very best route runners in the NFL. Even against great corners on good days, both receivers can consistently get separation in their routes and are reliable targets as they are natural hands catchers. Diggs is the primary outside receiver and Thielen plays largely in the slot; both receivers are interchangeable and will line up all over despite having primary roles. Whoever lines up against Diggs outside will have their hands full. Sidney Jones will have a very difficult matchup this week against Thielen when he does line up in the slot. There will likely be changes to the Eagles coverage schemes as they adjust to life without McLeod. It'll be up to the players to maintain discipline and minimize the breakdowns. They have to stop getting beat over the top so easily. They already have the challenge of slowing down two great receivers. Don't make things more difficult. It's also worth keeping an eye on TE Kyle Rudolph. He's a reliable receiving option for the Vikings but not the explosive player he once was.|
**Eagles Defensive Line vs. Vikings Offensive Line**|
The Eagles secondary will always be the primary matchup for the Eagles week to week given their ability to sink team efforts at times. However, the defensive line has a ripe opportunity in this one to cause a lot of problems for the Vikings and really be the difference maker we expect them to be. Death, taxes, and a poor Vikings offensive line. Last offseason they were aggressive to try and at least make a horrible unit serviceable and for the most part they succeeded in that endeavor. This year? Their line has regressed horribly and is on pace to shatter PFFs total pressures allowed in a single season by nearly 70. In their disastrous performance against the Buffalo Bills, the Vikings OL allowed a **53% pressure rate with 2.36 seconds Time to Throw.** That's not only bad, it's pathetic. For them, it isn't one player - it's the unit. Mike Remmers has been poor at RG even if he is more of a tackle. They just don't have other options. Hill is probably a decent backup tackle but that's deceiving given the weak tackle play in the NFL. Tom Compton is garbage at LG. Lastly, Riley Reiff has been bad at LT which is extremely concerning for the Vikings. He needs to be good. He has the pedigree on that OL. The one big reason why the Vikings have such a run/pass imbalance is due to the play of the OL. They simply cannot create space for Dalvin Cook and Latavious Murray to work through. On the season, PFF has charted QB Time to Throw against the Eagles at the following rates: Week 1 at 2.4 seconds, Week 2 at 2.21 seconds, Week 3 at 2.34 seconds, and Week 4 at 2.36 seconds. This is important to note as the lower this value is the more difficult it is for pass rushers to get to the QB no matter how good they are. This is why the Bills game is eye-opening as 2.36 seconds was Kirk's quickest Time to Throw on the season so far and the Bills still got to him at a 53% rate! The Vikings need to continue to get that ball out since the Eagles have a game-changing defensive line that's much better than the Bills. It behooves the Eagles DL to find similar success this week against the poor unit. This is a battle they should win and likely will. The talent discrepancy is just too large. How much it changes the game remains to be seen.|
**Eagles Offensive Line vs Vikings Pass Rush**|
The biggest early season surprise for the 2-2 Eagles is the inconsistent play of the offensive line through 4 weeks. This was the best unit in the NFL last season and still has the pedigree to remain among the top units. In the two weeks since Carson's return, the OL has allowed 9 sacks and an increase pressure percentage against blitzes and non-blitzes. Not all of those sacks and pressures are due to the OL but a large number of them are. This is still a talented, cohesive, and well-coached unit; we should expect this group to improve over time. The group has a lot of time played together and continuity is valuable which makes the sluggish start pretty surprising. They better figure out their issues pretty quickly given the quality opponent they have in front of them. Despite the Vikings early season defensive struggles, the defense front and their ability to bring pressure is still excellent. Fresh off an offseason contract extension, Danielle Hunter is a force on the EDGE. The Vikings will greatly miss Everson Griffen in his time away from the team but they still have the bodies on the EDGE to challenge the Eagles offense. Linval Joseph is still the monster IDL he has always been and will be a problem for the Eagles on Sunday. In the NFCCG, the Eagles we able to minimize his impact to an extent but he still made plenty of plays as he's as gifted as anyone in the league. Sheldon Richardson has made a sizable impact for the Vikings on the interior next to Joseph and form as good a duo as any in the league. If I were the Vikings, I would attack the IOL of the Eagles - namely at LG Wisniewski and C Jason Kelce. Kelce has had a strong start to the season but is a physical mismatch against both players. Wis has been off to a sluggish start on the season and is the weak line of the 5 along the line. It'll be paramount that the OL communicate and execute their assignments with more regularity than they've shown on the season. The defense front is still formidable without Griffen and can cause significant issues for the Eagles. On top of that, Zimmer likes to be aggressive and send rushers to get to the QB. The time is now to fix the lapses.|
**Eagles Weapons vs Vikings Defense**|
Alshon Jeffery has been a welcome and desperately needed addition to the offense that had to spend the first 3 weeks of the season manufacturing opportunities to get their bottom-end receivers space to make plays. While the Eagles are still down Mike Wallace and Mack Hollins, Jeffery and Agholor are two solid weapons to help the Eagles move the ball through the air despite the latter trying to party like it was 2016 against the Titans. As the season has moved along, the Eagles have been incorporating rookie Dallas Goedert into the offense more and more. He might not be at the receiving end of a lot of targets but his versatility to line up anywhere and block has been useful to increase the success rate of the offense. Zach Ertz is off to a scorching hot start to the season and is on pace for over 120 receptions for over 1200 yards. Ertz doesn't have any TDs on the season but anyone with a brain can see that has largely been a function of the offense and not the player. The Eagles are still dealing with injuries to Sproles and Clement; their status for Sunday is still up in the air. The Vikings defense has been poor to start the season so any additional bodies the Eagles can play will be welcomed. Wentz was largely outstanding last week against the Titans and will be looking to continue to grow against a talented Vikings defense. The Eagles are a bit short on weapons especially at receiver which might play into the Vikings hand a bit as they try to adjust to their own secondary issues. The Vikings play a very aggressive brand of defenses and teams have been using that against them ever since the second half of the Saints-Vikings playoff game. If the Eagles offensive line can bounce back they can continue to try and exploit the Vikings tendencies. The Eagles also need to play with more discipline as they are taking way too many penalties and putting the team at a disadvantage at nearly every turn. Do the Eagles have the discipline and enough talent to take advantage of a struggle Vikings defense? Or do the Vikings figure it out with the great talent they have on defense?|

9lo1nu,32,2018-10-05,Friday Fun Thread: Sidebars and widgets and buttons (oh my!),jkohhey,redesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/9lo1nu/friday_fun_thread_sidebars_and_widgets_and/,"Happy Friday, r/redesign!

Well, [we’re back](https://78.media.tumblr.com/ef472dd51b0fbcb210cc4de80661fb72/tumblr_inline_p4h4ppGWGd1qg38m8_540.gif), for another styling-themed Friday Fun Thread!

We started these threads to take time out from our usual stream of product updates, daily feedback, and [weekly release notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/search?q=flair%3Achangelog&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new) to chat with all of you about different aspects of **subreddit styling**. (If you missed the past few, you can catch up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/search?q=flair_name%253A%2522Friday%2520Fun!%2520%253Ahamster%253A%2522&amp;restrict_sr=1).)

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s jump in! This week, we chose the extra fun topic of sidebars, *and* widgets, *and* buttons. I know, I know: they may not sound like the splashiest part of a community’s styling, but they can be just as important (if not more so) than a fancy banner or voting icons. Related communities widgets can let your community find similar subreddits easily and compile helpful resources in one easy-to-access location. Sidebar images can bring attention to a stand-out piece of content or an important community announcement. And don’t even get me started on [buttons](https://i.gifer.com/73mC.gif).

So today, we wanted to give some love to communities that have really made the most of these features. Then, as always, we want to turn things over to you to hear about your favorite community sidebars, widgets, and buttons! 

Ands we’ve mentioned in the last few release notes, we’re working on an update to the button widget to allow alternative states and color fill so you can make your buttons as dynamic as you please. Once we’re done refactoring some code and testing, it will be rolling out soon.

# Image Widget Jones’s Diary

A few weeks ago, [this post](https://reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/99yukb/thanks_to_the_redesign_all_subreddits_can_now_set/) caught our eye (ha), highlighting how r/Keratoconus was using the easy-to-use image widget to share the CDC’s campaign for Contact Lens Health Week. 

https://i.redd.it/t8s94ggyceq11.png

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of creative image widgets, one of our early favorites comes from r/HighQualityGifs, whose sidebar gif sandwiched between the community rules and list of mods is perfectly HQG-y, with beautiful animated text and camera-shaking effects worthy of r/noisygifs. 

https://i.redd.it/1v5krjkwceq11.gif

# Cute as a button

Another fun use of the image (and CSS) widget: using it to make buttons that lead to important links for your community. 

r/pigifs continues to leave other communities in the mud with their creative takes on styling, and that’s obvious in the attention to detail they put into their sidebar button (secretly a CSS widget) that links to their community chat room. 

https://i.redd.it/lm1ydhb0deq11.png

Similarly, r/PCMasterRace has several beautiful buttons highlighting their Twitter, Steam, and Discord accounts so you can follow the community on other platforms. 

https://i.redd.it/90b7g8g2deq11.png

&amp;#x200B;

And r/SubredditOfTheDay uses speech bubbles to promote their nomination process and open call for writing interns to help write their daily community features.

https://i.redd.it/d90q4to3deq11.png

# Are you related?

We’ve been really happy to see so many communities using the “Related Subreddits” widget to highlight similar communities for their subscribers, which is one of the best ways for redditors to discover new communities (followed closely by r/trendingsubreddits, r/popular, r/findareddit, the subbie-of-the-day communities, and the more SFW entries of r/wowthissubexists...). 

r/GaySoundsShitPosts has a handy listing of other LGBTQIA-oriented meme communities. r/NintendoSwitch covers other communities from the Reddit Nintend-o-verse. And r/SanJose has doubled down on the related communities list by including showcases for both general local communities and local sports communities. 

https://i.redd.it/imxcoux5deq11.png

&amp;#x200B;

# Up-to-date

Last but not least, sidebars can highlight community events, whether they’re recurring weekly themes or specific items on your subreddit’s calendar. While a good ol’-fashioned text widget does the job of highlighting weekly post types, we built the calendar widget specifically for communities with lots of events happening ‘round the clock (just sync up your Google Calendar and let the widget auto-populate your next events!). 

For a classic text calendar, check out r/indieheads:

https://i.redd.it/mv8oole7deq11.png

&amp;#x200B;

And to see one of the busiest community calendars in all of Reddit, look no further than the sidebar of r/IAmA!

Got a favorite example of a stand-out sidebar or a whimsical widget? Let us know! (And last but not least, if you have ideas for the styling topics of future Friday Fun Threads, let us know those too. Thanks!)"
9lo6a4,1,2018-10-05,My girlfriend (21F) is depressed and suicidal and I’m (23M) running out of ideas to help her.,real-throw-away,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9lo6a4/my_girlfriend_21f_is_depressed_and_suicidal_and/,"To start with, this will be a long read, I want to thank you in advance for taking your time to read my story. The TL;DR is at the bottom.

I met my girlfriend about 2 years ago and we have been dating for a little over 1.5 years now. In general she has a low self-esteem, fear of failure and difficulty socializing. But it turns out she is also very depressed. 

About one month ago at night she suddenly started crying heavily and when I asked her what is wrong, she was mad at me and saying that I don’t care about her and that no one cares and that she just wants to die.

Obviously I was very concerned after that happened and I have been reassuring her that I do actually care, that she is important and that she needs help. After that I was slowly able to get her to talk a little bit about how she feels, before she would always shrug me off and I wouldn't press the matter. 

In general she just feels depressed and thinks that there is no point in her being alive. She sees no future except for her killing herself someday. When she was younger, she has been to some therapy, but it didn’t work for her then, so now she feels like therapy won’t ever work for her.

After talking a lot with her to figure out what is wrong and trying to help her, this is what I found out. She has been at least mildly depressed for about 6 years now, however at some times it is worse than other times. Recently she had to start doing an internship and unfortunately got to work at a place that she didn’t like that much, because of some small things. Because of her depression those small things became really annoying to her, and she felt unable to keep on working there. She quit that internship after 3 weeks and became even more depressed because of it. 

The day she had quit, I almost had to push her to let me visit her, I was really worried she might harm herself. She calmed down a little and it was only until the next day that I saw her legs for the first time and she had loads of self-inflicted scratch wounds on them.  

Afterwards, I somehow convinced her to not do that again. I also convinced her to start looking for a new internship and to go to therapy. She seemed to be doing a little better again. Unfortunately, she is only able to receive treatment more than 3 months from now. In the mean time she can go to a psychologist, she has gone once and is already saying it is not helping, probably because of her past experiences. 

Now this week she started a new internship and she also says she doesn’t like it and is not sure she will be able to continue it. Today she had her first test at school, which she failed and when she let me know she also said that she ‘just wants to stop with everything and rot away’. And that she 'is a failure who can't do anything'

Right now I don’t really know what I can do for her anymore. Everything I say she just ignores or doesn't believe me. Everything she tries just seems to make her more depressed. If she stops with her program because of the internship she’ll definitely become more depressed, because then she will have to move back with her parents in a different city. But if she continues with the internship she may also not be able to keep it up and become more depressed.

She just really needs a proper treatment for her depression and suicidal thoughts, but it will take months and by then she may have already made an emotional choice to quit that she may regret after receiving treatment or it might make her so much more depressed she doesn't even want to go to therapy anymore. 

Also I am running out of things to say to her and things I can do for her to keep her from becoming more depressed. It is really taking a toll on me, because I feel like no matter what I try, I can’t seem to help her. And every time she says something about not wanting to live anymore or something similar, a piece inside me dies. I am also the only one she relies on right now (she doesn't have many good friends) and I sometimes feel like giving up, which is making me feel like shit.

I don’t think she is an imminent danger to herself right now, but her overall mood seems to go heavily downhill and I don’t know what I can do for her anymore to keep her from getting more depressed before she can receive proper treatment.  What can I still do to help her?

TL;DR – My girlfriend is getting more and more depressed and suicidal. Even though I have now convinced her to go to therapy, it will take months before she can start there, at which point it may be too late. I’m running out of ideas to help her and sometimes feel like giving up, which is making me feel like shit. What can I still do to help her?"

Stats:

Undergrad GPA: 3.7
MCAT: coming out Oct 23 2018 
Research: over 3000 hours of research. Multiple conferences where I had my abstracts published. One first author publication and one where I co-authored on JBC.
Shadowing: shadowing over 2000 hours since I was working with a cardiologist since my first year of undergrad. Had an internship at stanford as well for cardiothoracic surgery. 

Which schools should I apply to for the next AMCAS season in 2019? I’m also a Canadian graduate so that makes me international.

I think my GPA and previous mcat scores are a bit low so Im hoping my ECs can pull through for me instead. I don’t think I’m too interested in DO schools either....

9lqhym,18,2018-10-05,How do I deal with a coworker that clearly does not like me? It is kind of getting me down...,Csgirlthrowie,girlsgonewired,https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/9lqhym/how_do_i_deal_with_a_coworker_that_clearly_does/,"Used to be a lurker and saw a similar post, but it must have been deleted. Anyways...

For some background: both this coworker and I both are female (not sure if this matters) recent college grads who started working at our company as soon as we graduated, which was May/June. This coworker and I are also ""cube-mates"", meaning that we both share a cubicle, which is a common layout at our office. 

These are things that make me feel like she does not like me so much:

* There is a group of RCGs that sort of hang out together, which we are more or less a part of. I noticed that any time I say something in that group, she basically just...ignores me and will only address and respond to the other dudes in the group. She also only ever seems to address and joke around with the other guys in the group...
* Any time I try to joke with her or start a conversation or anything, she just responds with either a one word answer, or she just flat out does not say anything at all and totally ignores me. I have even seen her roll her eyes at me before. It is not like I constantly try to disturb her while working either. At first I thought that may be the case (that she was simply too busy and I was ruining her groove by trying to talk), but I notice that she spends a large chunk of the day on her phone, or hanging out in other people's cubes just socializing and sending them memes over our workplace IM system. So basically, she seems to make an effort with literally everyone else (even the coworkers she has ranted and talked bad about before).
* I found out recently that she has a group chat with those other RCGs, which kind of hurts because it is like, why does she constantly bring it up in front me (both in one-on-one situations and while conversing with the other members) while knowing that I am not in it, or even trying to include me?
* She is very hot and cold with me. The only times she seems to be willing to talk is when *she* feels like it (meaning if she is bored or if she needs to rant about someone, and we have had lots of deep convos as a result, but this is rare), but she never ""returns the favor"" so to speak.
* There are a couple of guys in that RCG group that she is super close with, and sometimes I get the feeling that those guys also act strange with me as well. For example during a meeting I went to go sit next to those guys and the girl, and they all stopped smiling as soon as I approached and did not talk  to me at all. These guys were friendly before, but I have a feeling she told them something about me. She has also shut me down in conversations with them before....
* If I am in a conversation with any of the guys at work she also talks to, she walks away in a huff without even participating.

Also, as a side-note, she seems very well-liked by everyone, which makes sense since she is a good worker, but there are things I personally find off-putting about her:

* The fact that she shit-talks so many people in our office to me, and tells me so many personal details about her life, but then does the stuff I mentioned above, and...
* The other day during scrum, she began making fun of an intern on our team (calling him a ""cocky little kid that needs to be taught a lesson""). What was even more discouraging was the fact that our superiors who were also in the scrum team also laughed along with her, and also continued to make fun of that intern. The scrum lead while laughing also told her, ""Shhh he may hear you! He is right there!"" to which she responded, ""I don't care...."" which everyone laughed at even more. I actually saw the intern walk by the scrum room at the end of this exchange, and he looked super hurt (so it kind of bothers me that our superiors like her so much). 

I know that in the end of the day, that not everyone will like me and I recognize the fact that coworkers do not have to be friends. But I cannot help but feel kind of...upset at seeing all this, especially because I am literally stuck with her in a small space 8+ hours a day. I mean...I would like to feel like she doesn't flat-out dislike me at least. I apologize if this sounds whiney btw, I was wanting some advice or input on the situation. I also feel pretty alone, because I have no peers to talk to about this (I am not really close to others). I just do not know why she acts like this (afaik I do not smell...)?

Edit: I have done some introspection as well about the situation...wondering if I have ever said anything mean or offensive, but I really cannot think of anything."

A bit of a back story.

3 years ago I graduated university, I was the most hard working student. The teachers respected me, the students always thought how crazy it was that I was finishing my assignments 1 month before the deadline. I used to separate my time very well and was very disciplined. After I graduated I went to the US for a year (I’m in the U.K.) where I worked in a managerial position as an intern. During this time I met a business owner who offered me an H1B visa. He applied for it and I had to go back to the U.K. and wait on it. After coming back in September 2016 I said to myself that I’ll work whatever job that there is out there until March to both save some money and spend my time wisely until I get my visa approved. 

In January, he emails me and tells me he had to file for bankruptcy and no longer has a business. I still work at a call centre and then he tells me we can work together but remotely. I agree, we start working together, we worked for a month but after realising I was stuck in a call centre job I let him know that I need to focus on getting a better job first. It turned out the job market in the U.K. is not the same as in the US and to get a proper job you need to do a lot of digging. I couldn’t find the right job for me until November 2018. 

Time flies. I finally quit my job and starter working as a marketing communications executive, but after working here for 3 months I realised I don’t find marketing interesting (it’s a bunch of air), so I am now looking to go back to hospitality management (which I really enjoyed in the states). I am also interested in IT and business systems. Mostly helping and motivating people.

Now I’m stuck, I feel I’ve procrastinated 2 years of my life. I ended up graduating university with a 1st class honours (4.0 GPA) and having call centre experience and some aired out marketing communications job that doesn’t help me to grow at all and don’t think I have any specific skills 3 years after graduation. I am now 24 and will be 25 in a month and most of my friends from uni are managers for huge corporations and I am working in a small company in marketing (which I really dislike). All this puts me off, but I know that without applying I won’t get interviews, but at the same time I am now typing this at 11pm after telling myself at 5pm that after work, I’ll focus on applying for jobs.

I’ve applied to ZERO. All I did was stay on YouTube and watch videos all evening. 

How do I deal with procrastination that’s actually always in my mind but I hardly apply for jobs (do something productive) or if I start applying I would just start submitting my cv everywhere, because I feel like no one is gonna look at it anyway, because of my lack of skills.

And then I go to bed feeling guilty. "

9lr2ae,19,2018-10-05,[MF] Stairwell,_ya_,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/9lr2ae/mf_stairwell/,"I once got talking to this girl name Beth on tinder. We started out joking but somewhere between getting her number our conversation escalated. I remember we were so incredibly different at first, she was about to start an internship at Fox News and I’m anything but someone who likes that world. But each time I thought about bailing the hot girl in the photos and the escalating tension kept me going back.

I think she liked how when ever her political side and he obvious interest in just getting famous made me think less of her. I think she liked the hate fuck tension that was rising. The escalation led to how I would treat her like a slut. How I would make her my little conservative fuck toy. We planned for her to come over in her most work appropriate skirt and blazer. We planned how she would come all perfect and how I would ruin her.

I lived in a high rise at the time and when she got there I met here at the elevator. We had planned not to say anything but hello. Instead though when the door opened I told her I wasn’t going to use her my room. I wanted to take her to the top floor stairwell and use her in there. She looked confused but nodded so I took her up there. I took her to stairwell so her moans could bounce off the walls and echo twenty floors down.

Getting to the top I inspected her. Perfect makeup, perfect hair, her tits tastefully shown. She looked camera ready. I pulled her close and told her I think she is a shallow disgusting slut and I’m going to use her.

I undid my belt and wrapped her waist and the railing behind her attached to the overlook. I pulled down her blazer, her top and bra so her gorgeous pale tits were hanging out and then I tied her hands with a little black rope I had brought.

She was standing there exposed. I remember watching her nipples get hard. I asked her if she was a whore, she quietly said yes. I said louder, she responded not loud enough so I put my hand on her throat and said louder. She yelled she was a whore and it echoed all the way down.

She said she was nervous we would be caught. I said I hope we are. I wanted to make her exhilarated so I walked close and ran my hand up her soft bare leg to her uncovered cunt. She was soaking. I started slow gently grazing her lips. I wanted a fury to grow inside her wanting more but being scared to ask. As I touched I would get close to sliding my fingers in her slit to her clit. I wanted to make every millimetre closer I got to send lightening though her. She was loosing control starting to ask, starting to beg. I gave her what she wanted, I rubbed my soaking fingers on her clit and she shock. Her first orgasm came quick, her moans burst out and shivered. I remember she opened her eyes after and looked right at me.

I told her she’s going through show me her gratitude and make my cock as wet as her cunt. I untied the belt and she dropped to her knees. I undid my trousers and no hands she feasted on my cock. With no hands her tongue had to work all of me. I asked her if she liked the taste of my cock, she nodded, I asked her if she wants me to fuck her mouth, her eyes widened and she nodded. I made her choke on cock. She tasted all of me.

When I was feeling her tongue I stood her up, turned her around and with her tits hanging over the ledge and her having a view all the way down I dropped to my knees behind her and tasted her soaking cunt. I wanted to know the pussy I was having, I wanted to feel it with my tongue, I wanted her to moan and see how far away anyone could hear it.

It was hard not to just have her. Not long after my first taste, not long into her moaning did a growing wave of desire build in me. I wanted her. I wanted all of her. I stood up and I fucked her.

I fucked her deep, feeling that soaking pussy on my cock. Feeling her tightness open up. The colliding of her ass to me bounced off the walls. I slapped her pale ass, I grabbed at her. I took her.

The fucking was a fury. She was mine. I pulled away from the ledge and fucked her sitting on it. After she told me she was scared she was going to fall but wanted my cock too much to stop.

When I told her I was going to come she knew what to do. She dropped to her knees and took my come all over her perfectly destroyed face."

It reads more like a diary entry rather than a request for help, but it felt good to explain my situation. 

Hey guys,

I came to this sub a couple years ago under a different username and I found it incredibly helpful. I was able to quit smoking for nearly 2 months and I couldn’t have done it without the support from you guys (and anti-depressants) I relapsed when I went back to college and haven’t tried to quit since; it’s been about 2 years since then. I’ve been smoking daily for about 5 years now, not counting the 2 months when I quit. I am now in grad school in a state where weed is legal. Ever since I got my marijuana card (about 8 months ago) I have been smoking a lot more. I have unlimited access to weed now and that has made my dependence much worse. I am usually able to stay sober most of the day and I find myself getting stoned from around 5pm until I pass out around 12 at night. Some days I am not even able to make it until 5pm and I decide to get stoned and “end my day” at around 1 or 2 pm and stay stoned until I fall asleep. It’s pathetic. All I look forward to is getting to the end of the day so I can get stoned. My social skills are fucked. At first, the weed just made me socially awkward. Now, I don’t even want to be around people at all. Everybody just agitates the hell out of me. I am only happy when I’m in my apartment alone, stoned, and playing video games or watching tv. This is not how I want to live my life. I am wasting 8 hours a day getting stoned. I’m not productive when I’m high. When I smoke, my day is over. My depression and anxiety is getting horrible. I have been experiencing recurring thoughts of death. I’m not suicidal, but I keep thinking about dying, getting hit by a car, getting a horrible disease. I tell myself that it would be ok if any of these happened, even though I don’t necessarily want them to happen. I’m also developing all sorts of OCD-type habits. For example, when I leave my apartment, it sometimes takes me about 2-3 minutes to make sure the door is locked. I sit outside the door and just wiggle the doorknob and push the door back and forth until I know for sure that it is locked. My neighbors probably think I’m a fucking psycho and maybe they are right. My video game rage has gotten out of control as I find myself punching my legs and face when I play poorly. These types of problems happen when I’m sober and when I’m high. I know these issues may seem comical, but to me they are not funny at all. It’s like the weed is making all of my very minor problems turn into major problems. Social anxiety turned to social avoidance. Anger turned into complete rage. A little sadness has turned into depression. My minor OCD habits have become extreme, they are more bizarre and more time consuming than ever before. I’ve also been drinking a lot lately because I’m noticing that the weed isn’t really making me feel any better when I smoke. When I combine alcohol and weed I can feel some relief but not much. 
Even though weed is causing all of these problems for me, I still feel like half of me does not want to quit. I know deep down that I need to quit and I really want to quit. I really really really want to quit. I just can’t stop smoking. When I get home and the day is over, what am I supposed to do instead? I don’t like hanging out with people. I don’t really like doing anything other than playing video games or watching tv. And I’ve noticed that those are both incredibly boring when I’m sober. I’m worried that if I quit then everything might get worse and I might freak out and leave school or something. I’m almost done with grad school and I’m about to start an internship in a few months. I’ve made it this far as a stoner and I am truly worried that I will go crazy when If i get sober. Hell, I’ve even been avoiding any jobs or internships that drug test, which has seriously narrowed my search choice. Everything in my life is revolving around weed right now and I want to change. How the hell do I do it? Better yet, how the hell do I convince myself to do it? Sorry for the long post. I really needed to vent, but I am genuinely seeking help from you guys. I need to get this monkey off my shoulder for good and I simply don’t know where to start. "
9lsdir,48,2018-10-05,"My diagnosis, denial, treatment, and learning to love myself",CataclysmicKat,PCOS,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/9lsdir/my_diagnosis_denial_treatment_and_learning_to/,"My diagnosis was a long road. Saddle up this will be a long read. 

I’ll start with a little background on my mother.  She was raised in a family where you didn’t talk about your problems, and you sure as hell didn’t talk about girl parts. So she grew up believing her irregular periods were normal, because she didn’t know any better. When she finally saw a dr about it, they told her she’d never be able to have children. Spoilers - I am the miracle baby that was gifted with the PCOS genetics. Thanks mom.

I have always been overweight. My toddler, elementary, middle and high school pictures feature a painfully chubby girl with thin, greasy blonde hair. Growing up I had very irregular periods. I remember going years without them in middle school. I also remember asking my mother about it, and her telling me it was normal then quickly changing the subject. Around seventh grade, it became obvious to me that something was wrong. I had broad shoulders, small breasts, dark skin around my neck and under my arms, and I was getting hairy. I felt like a gorilla. I watched as the other girls around me blossomed into beautiful feminine creatures.

This next part is going to be hard to understand, so I just want to explain my frame of mind.  If you’ve done research on PCOS, you know how the imbalance of hormones can lead to anxiety and depression. Now pair that up with bullying (kids are mean when you look different) and low self-esteem. I had basically convinced myself that I was some kind of monster.

At the age of 16, I finally asked a dr about the dark skin on my neck (the least embarrassing of all my symptoms - no way I could admit to shaving my chin everyday). The dr sighed heavily and referred me to an endocrinologist.

The endocrinologist was probably the worst person I could have seen in that state of mind. When I asked the endo about the dark skin he got excited, and asked if he could bring in several interns to observe what this symptom looked like on a Caucasian. It made me feel like a freak. When the interns came in he then said to them out loud - “and notice the stubble?” Oh. Great. Secret is out I guess.  The endo put me on provera to force a period, since I hadn’t had one in a long time. Probably years at that point. He diagnosed me with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.

The provera triggered a horrific period. I remember walking down the street with my parents on our way to dinner, and being struck by pain so intense I curled up on the sidewalk in the fetal position. My mother was quite embarrassed. The dr hadn’t warned or educated me about what was going on. It truly was a traumatic experience. I swore off the drs that made me feel like a freak. I withdrew. I ran away from the problem. I refused to go to gynos because it was too embarrassing. I just knew that they’d take one look and say WOW! Colleagues, come quick! Come see the freak. The monster.

Over the next five years or so, sinus infections, the flu, and the common cold forced me to find a general physician that I trusted. Let’s call him dr boots. At the age of 21, I finally decided I trusted dr boots enough to ask about weight loss. He suggested a blood test to check my thyroid and hormones. The results showed high levels of testosterone. Those results in combination with my irregular periods and inability to lose weight was enough to diagnose me with PCOS and start me on metformin.

The metformin was rough, and I could never stick with it because of the horrible side effects. I went online and read about PCOS. I learned about the infertility, the risk of cancer, the genetics of it all. I ran from my problems again. I ghosted dr boots. I didn’t want his medicine, and I didn’t want his diagnosis. I felt sorry for myself for a long time.

Then I met my now husband, and suddenly it wasn’t about me anymore. It was about us. I owed it to him to take care of myself, and vice versa. I found a gyno and started birth control as treatment. It was wonderful. Regular periods, libido through the roof, my breasts got slightly fuller, the hair on my chin was still there but it got softer, and I started developing  HIPS. I felt like a woman! Not a monster.

During the past five years with my gyno I’ve had two ultrasounds. One time there were cysts, and one time there weren’t. My gyno says they can come and go.

I am now off of the birth control, because my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant naturally for the past two years. (I guess i am also selfish enough to pass the genetics on if I get the chance - so mom, I get it now) I’ve been in therapy for the past 10 months working through the past, and the present infertility issues.

I’m turning 30 in 15 days. I’ve cut sugar and carbs out of my diet. I’ve lost 10 lbs in the past month and a half. I’m wearing colors that aren’t black. I’m looking people in the eye when I walk by, not staring at the floor. For the first time, I am happy and content. I understand PCOS, and I am treating ALL the symptoms both holistically and with the help of my much trusted gyno. My amazing husband has been supporting me the whole way.

I’m starting clomid and progesterone next month as our first step in fertility treatments. We’re also discussing adoption, IVF and FET as possible next steps if the clomid doesn’t result in a pregnancy.

I’ve never shared my complete story with anyone other than my therapist. I realize that to people who are unfamiliar with PCOS it’s just a medical diagnosis, but PCOS affects more than just the medical. I went through shame, fear, denial, and depression. It affected my body, mind and spirit. For some people, the diagnosis feels like the end of the world. I just want those people to know they aren’t alone. Never be afraid to ask for help. Never tell yourself you aren’t worth fighting for.

This happy ending isn’t what I imagined it would be, but it’s happy all the same."
9lshzs,9,2018-10-05,[RESOURCE] The Return of the Reader Intern(Update 1),SaintsandCinephiles,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/9lshzs/resource_the_return_of_the_reader_internupdate_1/,"For those of you who frequent the sub, you may recall me announcing an unpaid internship position I started and how I promised to relay whatever insight I can onto this wonderful community. Clearly the weekly or biweekly plan backfired a bit. My life should (hopefully) be a bit less chaotic here on out, so my hope is to be less sporadic with these updates. 

As mentioned last time, I have very little experience with the job itself but hopefully this is of some use to someone. At the very least, ask me some questions and I'll do my best to provide an adequate answer or an inadequate source of laughter--namely puns and dad jokes, sorry. 

I'll speak to no specificity content, names, etc. but will work with the gray area that I can afford. 

**Genre**

No one genre is eyed by this prodco. I myself have covered a variety ranging from thriller to romance to biopic, comedy and onward. Drama seems to function best, though I admittedly have only a limited sample size from which to derive this conclusion. A lot of what I've read so far is comedy but not tangibly humorous. That is to say the timing of jokes often failed to hit their mark or beats were simply misplaced. As with standup comedy, for instance, timing is key. Also, some material was too... distinct to reach as far an audience as the writer likely intended. If a punchline relies on knowledge of niche slurs or specific occupation-related jargon, certain limits are inherent. A comedy also needs more than a handful of sarcastic remarks to really warrant a comedy categorization. Speaking back to the matter of Drama's dominance in what I've read, this can potentially be attributed to writing ability and thus coincidence. The thrillers and comedies seemed to focus too much on fitting their respective molds, placing momentary tension or humor above plot.

**Premise**

Originality is not without its value if this has not already been made clear to you elsewhere. X meets Y may be a suitable approach for pitching your idea, but legitimately meshing two films together and tossing in new names fools no one. Elements are clearly piggybacked on a regular basis, but this is nothing new. Novelty itself is a commodity most cannot afford. That said, when a new spin is placed on an existing idea, when someone truly demonstrates an innovative take on a known device, it stands out. Opinion or otherwise, it's okay to have a niche audience in mind when writing. Will it render you a millionaire? Unlikely, but if a story is worth telling--and worth seeing on screen--it is bound to be noticed. Sometimes staying true to that narrow focus eliminates opportunities for cliches and the likes. In a world of reboots, re-imaginings, and revivals... reinvigorate the market with something boldly unique. 

**Formatting**

Wow. So a) prodcos care less about this than we're led to believe but b) it works in your favor to have a screenplay that is easy to read and without blatant errors with format. If you're going to pitch your script to an exec or producer, for the love of whoever you believe in, get rid of the little notes you left for your cowriter during the initial drafts. A mistake here or there is admittedly bound to go unnoticed or at the very least not given enough attention to warrant any detraction from the quality of your screenplay overall. Touch up on what you know about headers, proofread like thirty times, avoid parentheticals that last five sentences, etc. 

**Writing**

Own your voice. If you aren't confident in it yet, hone it. Some of the best material I've read so far is so unmistakably particular and fresh that it's hard not to keep reading. Admittedly, this is where I ultimately fail as a writer and now recognize that. You want your script to demand notice. You want it to have pizzazz, to have gusto, to have the strange but fitting personification of jazz hands. Beyond a need for voice, all I can recommend is the same information drilled into our brains from one educator to the next: make it clean and make it professional, but make it exciting! 

I'll check in sometime next week or the week after. In the meantime, feel free to throw any questions at me. As mentioned above, I'll try to answer them but if I am capable only of hurling back the same joke your nine-year old cousin offered up at last year's Thanksgiving dinner table, please don't hate me."

First offer is from EY as an assurance intern. I haven't received a written offer, but they called and told me that they are making one right now. I really liked EY and always dreamt about working there. However, as I was going through interviews, Baker Tilly caught my attention as well. I really liked their office and everything about Baker Tilly. For EY, I couldn't see myself working there for a long period of time, but I can see myself working at Baker Tilly in the long term. But I always wanted to work at one of the big 4 companies and EY was my top choice out of all of them. Which company will benefit me in the long term? Will rejecting Baker Tilly hinder my chance at working there later on? Are there more benefits (higher salary, etc) for interns that come back as full-time compared to a regular new hire?

9lv0z5,28,2018-10-06,Persistence wears resistance - i too got a new amazing job,CenarioDantesco,userexperience,https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/9lv0z5/persistence_wears_resistance_i_too_got_a_new/,"I want to share a little bit of my story, and maybe inspire others to not giving up, or even cheer up a little. In 2007 i got into university,  studied communication design, but i had to quit on my second year, it became too expensive and i did not had a job to continue paying. I never doubted of what i could contribute to any team, but i didn't had experience, and every place i applied required experience, even internships!

Fast forward 2011, after some tough jobs in stores with low pay and very long hours, i felt that i had to get back into Design, like no more ""side jobs"", and so i dedicated myself to be a freelance designer. I did not had a client base, so days would go by and i would do occasional works for friends, so not much income from it. 

I started to devour every article, inspirational image sites, and decided to increment my bare knowledge of front end. I started to feel more confident, and figured: since i do not have works to build a portfolio, i'll just create my own briefings and build the projects.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing with my newfound knowledge was to code from the ground up my personal portfolio, no frameworks, no behance, just a place of my own that i could showcase what i could do. Following that i created briefings about products i would like to work: an android App, a iOS App, find and redesign websites i felt i could deliver something better, my own branding, stuff like that. Sent tons of applications to many places, some of them would reply to tell me, very politely, no.

&amp;#x200B;

I would feel discouraged, for brief moments, then get back into improving myself. Started reading more books about ux, and the first one was The Lean Product Playbook, by Dan Olsen. With it i got into UX, what was it and how to apply to my own projects. That landed my a trial 2 month job at a startup, which translated quickly into a yearly contract. I was over the moon!

By the end of last year, disaster struck. The business model of the Startup was android apps market, and after 2 years the board of directors decided to shift the business model to cryptocurrency, so we made an ICO. In a span of 2 weeks we had to build everything, from white paper to website, to the technology to be implemented. Everyone gave 200%. One day before the funding deadline hit, the CEO and CTO called me to a conference room and told me they would let me and 12 more colleagues go, the company was being restructured and they no longer had room for me. I was flabbergasted! For many reasons: in a team of 7 designers, i was the 2nd Designer longest in the company, more rounded in fields other than UX/UI and the only one of the whole team to be let go. I felt like they did not wanted me anymore, so i made a deal with them, relinquished my contract, got some money and left the company.

The day after this event, the company got funded. Lots of money again, but the harm was done. They started to hire a lot of people again. The people that stayed in the company decided to start to leave by they own initiative, they did not felt safe or comfortable anymore working there. The company is still bleeding talent to this day, some people joined but almost no one with some reputation want to work there.

(wow this is getting long, bear with me!)

With only my savings i started to look for a new place to work. A company hired me to lead designer role within the marketing team. The pay was a lower than my previous job, but i though what da heck, maybe i'll have a deep impact in this company and help to shape great products. I was wrong: the computer i had to work was this extremely loud computer, a half assed monitor with all the colors messed up. The tasks were underwhelming, doing brochures, fixing wordpress code in a very messed up code database -- you name it, after two months i decided to leave them.

&amp;#x200B;

Three weeks ago i got a job alert to a UX lead role for a new startup. They required 5 years of experience. Although i'm very capable i did not had 5 years as a UX designer under my belt, i got 3 so far. I decided to apply anyway, because what do i have to lose, right? 2 days after i got a email of the CEO interested in me and my work! I went through 3 interview phases, one of them was a challenge and i passed all. Today i got the contract proposal by email: the pay is way over what i asked for, at this point of my career, i'm the team lead and i will get to work with some previous coworkers from the company i was let go months before. 

Bear in mind that for this role, i couldn't provide on my website the work i did in the previous company due to NDA, so i did the same as before, created a version 2 of my website, with 2 projects showcasing what i can do. You can visit my webfolio here: [http://the-gaspar.surge.sh/](http://the-gaspar.surge.sh/)

Mine is Computer networking and I finished it with a final grade of 17.1 out of 20, my question is, how can I apply with this course? In Portugal to enter computer science I would have to do the math exam to enter, what about the Netherlands?
My plan is to move to the Netherlands in January and start working and organize myself and see if I would really want to live there, and then start studying in September if I do like to live there. But I can't figure out how to enter with my course, since it's not the regular school system.
Also how does the ""Loaning money"" work? And can someone give me an estimate on how much would it cost per month to live in there Netherlands?

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. I have the entire long weekend off and want to keep myself entertained! Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M) (Sonic)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama (all characters will be aged up to +18)

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

[Breitbart Blacklisted from Use on Wikipedia as ‘Reliable Source’](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/03/breitbart-blacklisted-from-use-on-wikipedia-as-reliable-source/)

Wikipedia editors have had Breitbart News formally listed as an unreliable source, meaning it can not be cited for factual claims. Editors have responded by purging citations to Breitbart News throughout the online encyclopedia, a move no doubt designed in part to hurt Breitbart’s search engine results ranking. Discussion of the blacklisting saw overwhelming numbers of left-wing politically-motivated editors supporting the ban, citing the example of a similar ban on the Daily Mail imposed early last year.

Similar calls for blacklisting Breitbart News on Wikipedia have been made in the past year in response to Breitbart’s critical reporting about the online encyclopedia’s rampant left-wing bias. Breitbart’s reporting on Wikipedia’s many failings have aroused consternation among its editors with left-wing Israeli outlet Haaretz once claiming Breitbart had “declared war” on the site after its report lambasting Facebook for using Wikipedia’s shoddy article on Breitbart News. Following a Breitbart News report last year on editors downplaying violence by Antifa, an administrator and then-member of the site’s powerful Arbitration Committee, the site’s “supreme court,”  removed links to the report from a place on the article’s discussion page used to note press coverage, claiming Breitbart News is not part of the press.

Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow slammed Wikipedia for its decision, stating “Wikipedia has been and always will be fake news, and they know it. They believe facts are subject to a democratic process, and the only people with a vote are the bubbled leftists who edit Wikipedia. There is no mob rule when it comes to “true or false.” Even academia knows this, which is why Wikipedia is not considered valid in most classrooms.”

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago I decided to go back to school full-time by taking out loans. (I'm doing this program at my community college to become a Histotechnician) Everything was going relatively smoothly, until recently-ish. I got a paid summer internship, but my school is terrible at processing paperwork so I was never paid for my work and will allegedly become a staff member by the end of this month. My summer class I needed got cancelled, they said it would be this Fall, got cancelled. Said it would be this Spring for reals, and the professor emailed me personally to say that it might not be available in the Spring either. I've already done all of my core classes (Microbio, Chemistry, etc..) and I really need to get these Histo-specific courses done to finish my goal! I can't keep taking out loans forever because a) That shit's expensive and b) I will get cut off eventually. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I feel like a fool who thought it was possible for me to make something of myself since I dropped out of college in 2012 due to a nervous breakdown. This year I decided to take some lower division science courses to help me complete my eventual bachelors in Biochem or Mathematics. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO, I'm posting this in this sub because the stress is eating me alive. I'm super dependent on Kratom to get through my school work and Phenibut to sleep and calm me down. Over time, my usage has gone from occasional to daily Kratom use and Phenibut 3x a week-ish. Sometimes, I will abuse my Gabapentin to take the egde off. I also have generic Ambien for insomnia which makes me feel like shit but if I don't sleep I will be crying all day. Basically I will use tons of substances, all the time. Lots of herbs too. No alcohol though, and haven't been using pyshcs. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I've lost weight, which feels good but I missed my period this month (not pregnant) which tells me I'm way too stressed or the weight loss happened too quickly. I feel like I'm also having compulsive thoughts that upset me. I just started seeing a counselor at my school, she's great but its only every other week. I feel like I need daily therapy! ALSO, my school has been really slow with processing my loan this year...I've been in school since Mid-August and haven't received my loan disbursement and my bf has been paying my rent and utilities for 3 MONTHS, and probably another month as I wont be seeing loan money until November probably...He's super sweet about it but he's been working really hard to support us and it causes me a lot of anxiety. He also encouraged me to go back to school in the first place because he knows I'm a smarty pants and wants to see me succeed and not make lattes or work at the junks store anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Blagh I dunno its all so much and I just need to vent. I'm also very competitive with school and will push myself really hard to get A's because I HATE the feeling of not knowing the answers or struggling through a test, which gives me really bad anxiety and low self-esteem. I'm damed if I do, and damed if I don't. I know that if finances weren't an issue I could really succeed and learn all the things but I feel like it's just not within my reach. Being a full-time student paying Bay Area rent without any income is fucking insanity, but so is working a dead-end job that hurts my body. (I'm fragile and have neck problems). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anybody else out there who loves science/school and also drugs but just can't cope with the stress anymore?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to do the little summary with the tlrd; bit or whatever it is, so sorry about that. 

I'm dependent on substances and my bf just to get through life and I don't know when I'll ever get this stupid certificate or have a real job and earn a living wage to pay back these god-forsaken loans and credit card bills, car insurance etc etc..."

I grew up out west and love to travel - Currently on the east coast, I'd love to have an internship experience the company would pay for my housing and get something great on my resume!

I have an idea for a web application, it would be my first real side project... But since I'm inexperienced, it's probably going to take a while to create. 

**For someone that feels inadequate, please tell me how I can best spend my time to get a great software internship!**"
9m19ya,4,2018-10-06,Tips for breaking into the music industry (marketing)?,koolkandi2,musicmarketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/9m19ya/tips_for_breaking_into_the_music_industry/,"I was wondering if anyone can give me some pointers on getting into the music industry.

Background:

I have a B.A. in Communications.

While in college, I interned within the music industry for some time, working at a music startup and a holding company that owns multiple venues in the NYC area (as their marketing intern), as well as a New York based music PR firm (as their publicity intern).

During that time, I also was a part of a program that taught me digital marketing skills in SEO, SEM, and Paid Social.

\-

I want to find a way to combine my passion for music with my background in marketing, but I'm just not sure where to start.

I started looking into networking events in the NYC area. I follow various companies (i.e. Warner Music Group, AEG, Bowery Presents, etc.) on both LinkedIn and social media. Right now, I'm going to look into various volunteer opportunities (I also street team on the side for Fueled By Ramen).

I was just curious what other things I can do to meet more people within the industry and turn my passion to work in music a reality."
9m1fut,11,2018-10-06,The Thing With Brendan Is...,kaboomblamzoom,StevenAveryCase,https://www.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryCase/comments/9m1fut/the_thing_with_brendan_is/,"Some redditors are trying to crap on Brendan. He wasn't a good alibi for Steven because he would have to admit he saw Steven, he wasn't coerced, he provided pertinent details only someone present would know, he's not a retard etc...

In early November 2006 Brendan is interviewed for the first time while up at the family cabin and after some aggressive interrogating there are two key things noticed by or mentioned to the officers. First, Brendan asks the officers if they thought Steven raped Teresa. KK &amp; some redditors hang on this like there is only one explanation for it. That being that he has specific knowledge that Steven raped Teresa. It can be nothing else but this. The more plausible reason though is curiosity and familiarity. He knows his uncle was falsely convicted of raping a woman and spending 18 years in prison. It is natural for him to become curious and to ask this type of question to the investigators thinking ""Oh is this what they are going to try to do to him again?"". The second key thing is Brendan caves into pressure from the investigators and quickly his story of ""I didn't see her"" became ""I did see her but as she was leaving"". This information was conveyed to F&amp;W and they quickly came to realize how suggestible and easily manipulated Brendan can be. They decided for the time being to sit on this information. 

I find it incredibly weird that after getting revised statements from Barb, Blaine, Scott &amp; Bobby that placed Brendan at the fire that Brendan wasn't interviewed by F&amp;W much sooner than he was. He has definitely been named an alibi for Steven. I feel like it was a timing issue. They know memory fades and so the further from the actual time of events in late October to early November the less details Brendan would remember. The less he actually remembers the more they can recreate those memories for him.

Now for some unknown reasons Earl makes up a story about seeing blood in the concrete (sometime between December 2005 &amp; January 2006) and tells this to his daughter Kayla. She takes what she has learned from her father and conjures up a story to tell her school counselors. This apparently takes place in January 2006 however, it is not reported to the police/investigators at that particular time. Keep in mind that these school counselors are interviewed after Brendan is arrested (and oddly enough these counselors' interviews aren't in the CASO report). In February 2006 investigators interview Kayla where she talks about Jodi's claims of abuse, she mentions she has never been sexually assaulted by Steven and at the end she mentions that Brendan has been ""acting out"" and lost about 40lbs and that she &amp; Candy (her mother) had noticed a bonfire at Steven's on Halloween while visiting her grandmother (Dolores). Her definition of ""acting out"" is staring into space &amp; crying. She was never pressed further for anymore information. 

At the end of February 2006 just a few days after speaking to Kayla F&amp;W interview Brendan several times. In his first interview at the school they do not read Brendan his Miranda rights. Now the law apparently states that because they are not in a police setting and he is not considered a suspect (both reasons why Brendan is first interviewed at MHS) that they do not have to read him his rights. So after methodically with many tactics such as emotional manipulating, praising him (for telling them information they deemed believable), making promises of going to bat for him and not leaving him high and dry &amp; out right lying to him etc... they coerce a confession out of him. Now their intent might have been just to get him to incriminate Steven because this is corroboration from a witness that was present for ""the bonfire"" and further proof that this was Teresa's body that was discovered there. However, over time seeing how easy it was to get their narrative out of him they got greedy &amp; lead him down a path of no return. A day later at the beginning of March 2006 they re-interviewed Brendan continuing their methodical manipulative tactics. He is then arrested. Promises were broken and Brendan was left to hang high &amp; dry.

When looking back on this I have thought of this new question. Why did Barb agree to let the investigators speak to her son in the first place in February? Barb among others have placed Brendan at the bonfire with Steven. The place where the bones have been discovered. Is she really that stupid to think that the investigators are not going to talk to her son Brendan to figure out what he knows? Does she not want to protect her son? 

It is now in early March 2006 and as mentioned above the investigators speak with the intern school counselor (who contacted police after hearing Brendan was arrested) about her discussion with Kayla in early January 2006. A few days later they speak to Kayla again and she now mentions that Steven has continually sexually assaulted her, she initially states she can't remember what she told to the counselors but over time (I'm sure with a little nudging from investigator's because this wasn't being recorded) she admits she told counselors about Teresa being pinned up in chair, that she admits it was her dad's story of blood coming up from the concrete, that after talking with Brendan at a party he admitted to her seeing bones in a fire and being shook up about it and finally that Brendan delivered mail to Steven, saw Teresa &amp; when he left he heard screaming. She also made a claim that this might be corroborated within a diary she kept however upon review of her diary, investigators didn't get the corroboration they were looking for.

IMHO if you read both her interview in CASO (page 692) &amp; her written statement [https://i.imgur.com/zm8nYlw.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/zm8nYlw.jpg) you can clearly see she is highly emotional and blinded by her current feelings towards Steven (she has recently learned that her sister Marie is alleging to have been raped by Steven). She doesn't realize the chaos she has just created and how it is going to affect her cousin Brendan. This is why by the time trial comes around in 2007 she recants her statement. I have read on FB that a friend of hers makes the claim that Kayla feels deeply sorry for her part in Brendan's imprisonment and that at the time Kayla was just looking for some attention and it just went off the rails so fast. I have no verified proof of this so naturally you can take this with a grain of salt. 

A few months later in May 2006 LK (Brendan's attorney) hires a private investigator MoK and together they screw Brendan over with more biased investigating and more coerced statements. LK allows F&amp;W to interview Brendan again without a lawyer or parent present. The result of this was even more outlandish claims from Brendan which lead to complete frustration from F&amp;W. So much so that they ended up devising a new devilish &amp; emotional manipulative tactic and pleaded with him to speak with his mother (Barb) about what they had just talked about before they speak to her. This trickery lead Brendan to confess yet again over a recorded voice message. Not to long after the Judge finally saw LK &amp; MoK for the unethical people they are and kicked these two to the curb. However, it didn't stop the Judge from allowing the byproduct of their actions to be accepted evidence for trial. Did you know that KK, TF &amp; NG made a gentlemen's agreement with Brendan's new lawyers MF &amp; RE that they would not mention anything from this final interrogation at the trial? Oh more trickery because come trial they talked extensively how Brendan confessed to mommy (going so far as playing the audio from the phone call to the jury).

Now while Brendan is learning disabled he is not a retard and it is only some redditors who jump to that conclusion. He is easily manipulated &amp; suggestible and his low IQ is a huge factor why. I think all of the Dassey children have low IQs and are easily manipulated/suggestible. This is reflected in the fact that all of them are blue collar workers as opposed to white collar workers and that all of them caved into the pressures put on them by LE to change their statements. They all did so with relative ease. Speaking to Brendan’s low IQ and suggestibility are all the reports and testimony providing the necessary information to confirm such. MW at some point himself made a statement to the affect of ""Knowing Brendan the way I do now..."" acknowledging that he knows Brendan is easily manipulated and suggestible. 

The fact of the matter is that Fassbender &amp; Weigert (as mentioned above) learned of Brendan's suggestibility from his first interview. They knew that put in the right atmosphere they can do what they do best. F&amp;W were going to re-interview Brendan at some point because days after witnesses had given their first statements Dedering, Steier and Baldwin had witnesses change parts of their statements to give the appearance that there was a fire on Halloween. These witnesses claimed that Brendan was potentially there. It is this fact alone that deemed Brendan was an alibi for Steven &amp; that F&amp;W needed to take care of. 

Brendan, as you can see in this file, “corroborates” some key information to F&amp;W [https://www.convolutedbrian.com/Support/first-mentions-dassey-interrogations.pdf](https://www.convolutedbrian.com/Support/first-mentions-dassey-interrogations.pdf) This is further proof that Brendan didn’t know the pertinent details and they were fed to him by F&amp;W. As well at other times he made guesses that F&amp;W accepted as being truthful and eventually KK did too. KK announced all this information in his big press conference after Brendan’s arrest. 

Some redditors are correct that Brendan wasn’t going to be a good alibi for Steven but not for the reasons they believe. The reason Brendan wasn’t going to be a good alibi for Steven was because he was never at a bonfire on Halloween with Steven. He was only at Steven’s for a short time to help Steven push a car into the garage. Afterwards he went back home. The events of Brendan helping to collect garbage around the yard and having a brush fire happened a day or two after Halloween. This can be verified by Steven &amp; Barb’s phone records. She called Steven to make sure Brendan was wearing a sweater or coat. This phone call didn’t happen on Halloween. Steven was the one who called Barb on Halloween after speaking with Jodi. When Steven called the line was busy suggesting that either Brendan was on the PC or on the phone.

In regards to Brendan &amp; Steven having to admit they saw each other that day for either one to use the other as an alibi I only have this to say: Their time together was brief and uneventful. I’m confident that if the investigators had placed in front of either Brendan or Steven, Steven’s jail log call to Jodi that it would have refreshed their memory. If you don’t know what I am talking about, let me explain, in the jail log it states that Steven told Jodi that he had Brendan over at his house helping him.

So as you can see all these claims some redditors make regarding Brendan are rubbish, including their final point that Brendan’s interrogation isn’t coerced because the court of law has inevitably upheld it. They are leaving out the part where some judges do in fact deem it coerced. This my fellow redditors is a clear example of how the law is interpretive. This essentially means that just because the full en banc U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals judges have deemed it not coerced that doesn’t mean if you had a full set of different judges that decision would be the same. This ultimately also goes for Steven Avery’s case. Just because Judge Angie denied motion after motion doesn’t mean the presiding judge at the Court Of Appeals will deny it as well."

9m1np0,1,2018-10-06,M4F Cuckolding Your Husband With A Boy Stud A Third Your Age,freeusestud,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9m1np0/m4f_cuckolding_your_husband_with_a_boy_stud_a/,"This is a prompt directed at all the women of dpp who are a little more experienced. By that I mean, you’re not the tight assed college coed you used to be. You’ve been married for a while now, and have the stretch marks and slightly sagging ass to prove it.     
    
Things weren’t always this way. You can remember a time when just walking through the door used to give your husband a hard on. He used to come up behind you as you rummaged through a drawer, and press his crotch against your ass as he reached around to mash your tits together. 

Send back then was more fulfilling. I mean, you used to look at yourself in the mirror as you fucked and think  l*damn, we could be pornstars* as you watched your husbands firm muscular back move as he plunged his throbbing 26 year old cock inside you. 

But things have changed. Your tight toned thighs are less so, having never really gotten back into shape after the first kid. Instead of coming up behind you to grab a feel, he’s tapping you on the shoulder to ask where the tums are, his heartburn getting the better of him. 


On the rare occasion you do have sex, he’s always tired, and it’s a quick sorry affair. After he pulls out of you, ten strokes after entering, you lay back and sigh, unsatisfied, with his cock barely doing much more than get you frustrated. You might even sneak off to the bathroom to play with someone who’s become a friend over the years: your detachable showerhead. 


Now that the kids are all off in college, it’s even worse. You either putter about an empty house, or come home from work to a house with just you and your husband, with him asking you for help putting in his new anti fungal cream. 

But one day, that changes. Maybe it’s the new neighbor, a 16 year old boy living off a trust fund. Or the high school intern at your corporate office.  Or maybe even a new trainer at the gym, the young junior quarterback. You joined a year ago, hoping that you getting back into shape would spark something in hubby, but nothing. He barely acknowledges your new, tighter abs, or realizes that your ass is firmer than it’s been in years. 

But this new man, he notices. You start to feel deja vu when he looks at you. The desire in his eyes reminiscent of earlier days, when you could walk down the street and know that every man in sight was looking at you like that. 


So, that’s my idea. To be clear, I’m not looking for a one off wham bam thank you ma’am here. I want to build a story. You aren’t going to throw twenty years of marriage away for a quick fling, you’re going to make me work for it. Maybe at first we have a frantic make out in the janitors closet, or the gym after hours. But slowly I’ll wear you down. You’ll end up coming to the gym, knowing that as soon as everyone else leaves, you’ll be peeling down your tight yoga pants as I dive between your sweaty legs and lap away at your musky pussy. Or getting on your knees beneath your own fancy oak desk and trying to get your nose to push against my pubes as you deep throat my cock. A cock, by the way, that is bigger than your husbands ever was. 

Then the clincher. The day you invite me to your house. I show up around noon, and make my way up to your room. You’re sitting in your bed in a lace negligee, laying out on satin sheets as I enter. We spend hours making wild love, interspersed with slow, passionate sex, the kind where we look into each other’s eyes and cum together, in a wave of physical and emotional pleasure. 


The time passes by without us noticing, that’s how engrossed we are with each other’s bodies. It happens during a particularly animalistic session, the fourth time we’ve fucked that day. I have you pressed against the wall, your legs wrapped around my back as I bounce you on my cock, your pussy juices, mixed with the previous loads I’ve left inside you, running out of your pussy down my balls. Your husband walks in, horror etched in his face. Instead of you jumping back and crying excuses, you tell me to go ahead, which I do. In front of your horrified husband, I come deep inside you. My balls clench as I blow my hot potent load inside you, overflowing your gash. 

Well then, I had a lot of fun writing that. If you sympathize with this character, or just like the idea, I’d love to see if we can work out some sort of roleplay together. I can’t wait to see your messages. "

“Oh my gosh thank you for  coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor sandra babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her the myriad of inappropriate outfits she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy low cut top and skirt when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "
9m2rzh,3,2018-10-07,I don’t know anymore,hey_alyssa,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9m2rzh/i_dont_know_anymore/,"This year has been so hard. Ever since the end of January I feel like my life has just been spiraling out of control.

Let me start from the beginning because this is my
First ever post and I just need to get all of this off my chest. I apologize if this becomes incoherent or anything like that. 

Last year was pretty good. I was in college making decent grades, enjoying my classes and enjoying my job. I was set to start a year long student teaching internship at an elementary school in August 2017 and I was so excited for it. I was so excited to start my career as an elementary teacher and I was so excited to graduate and have my own classroom. I’ve always been up and down with depression. I’ve never been formally diagnosed but I feel the symptoms all matched up to what I was going through. After I graduated high school in 2012, I feel into a deep deep pit of sadness and hopelessness and I stopped talking to literally everyone. For a while I had forgotten how to talk, how to make conversation and how to interact with anyone because of how isolated I made myself. I finally pulled myself out of that around 2016 and things were looking up. 

I thought I had figured out what I was going to do with my life and I was determined to graduate and get a job in 2018. I made friends, had a job I liked and was good. Then that job turned shit and my boss made my life a living hell. Every day I went in I was nearly having panic attacks because she was always bitching to me about something or getting on to me about a rule she changed and never told me about.

 I finally plucked up the courage to quit that job after two years but it soured my relationship with my mom because she lost respect for me for quitting a job with no other job lined up. Ever since then I feel like her respect for me was lost and our relationship has never been the same. 

That was back in January 2017. I found a new job in May 2017 that I love and still currently work. In August 2017, I met my ex boyfriend who I instantly fell for, HARD. He was so amazing and really helped me. I started my student teaching internship at the same time and my life was finally starting to look up again. I felt happy and confident and cared for. 

Then January 2018 happened. That boyfriend and I ended our relationship after realizing that we didn’t want the same things in life (I wanted children in the future, he didn’t) and it hurt me, bad. It was a short relationship but the breakup was so out of the blue, I hadn’t expected it at all. It was like a train came out of nowhere and hit me hard. He also became my source of stress relief and became one of my closest friends. 

At the same time I was starting the second semester of my student teaching internship and things started to go down hill. The teacher I was with and I had major differences and I felt like she never really guided me in my studies, she just threw me to the wolves and criticized me with no help. She also frequently took over my lessons and talked over me to our students if I stumbled at all. Then she never gave me constructive feed back, just made backhanded comments about my lessons. She never helped me improve my planning, just overall did not help me in the slightest. I was also slipping in my classes so my grades started to slide. 

I felt rejected, I felt like a failure and I felt out of control. So remember when I said my boyfriend had become my stress relief? Well with him being gone, I reverted back to my old way to deal with stress, I started eating. I’ve gained 20 lbs in these 10 months and started talking to a piece of shit guy who tugged me around and played with my feelings. 

So I finally graduate, but instead of being excited I’m filled with a familiar debilitating sense of hopelessness and confusion. My student teaching experience absolutely ruined any confidence I had in my teaching abilities and I have no desire to teach anymore. I have this job that I love and wouldn’t mind moving up in but pay isn’t great and there aren’t any opportunities at the moment. I have to start paying student loans next month and I don’t know how I’m going to be able to afford it. 

I feel so out of control and confused about everything. I’m irritable all the time, I feel spaced out and grayed out. I’m having trouble remembering things and having trouble remembering moments that should make me happy. I can’t even describe exactly what I’m feeling. I just feel.........I DONT KNOW!!!!

I feel s hopeless and blah and idk what to do. I want to go see someone but I don’t know where to start. I’m tired of being so overweight and feeling like total garbage all the time but I can’t stop eating shit food. 

I’m just tired of everything. I don’t know what I’m hoping to gain from this post. Maybe some words of validation. Idk. I just need to reach out to someone. Anyone willing to listen. 

If you made it to the end honestly bless you, all the updoots for you. ♥️ "

9m40ye,10,2018-10-07,"Starting an IRL support group, I'm pretty hopeful about this. I made a list of subjects/themes to discuss. Ideas, inspiration?",KatMetRuitjespatroon,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/9m40ye/starting_an_irl_support_group_im_pretty_hopeful/,"Hey everyone,

The biggest coincidence happened as through a mutual acquaintance, a woman doing an internship and I met each other. We had *exactly* the same plan at the same time: start a support group for adult children of mentally ill/addicted parents. She wants to do it as a project for her internship, I wanted to do it because I really long for people who *understand*. It's really isolating to have such a different background and home life than most people and I've wanted to meet people with similar issues for years. It's a lonely experience, knowing that most people just don't *get it*. 

We're still at the earliest stages, and I recently made a list with possibly subjects to discuss. Here's what they are, translated:

* Abuse

* What was going on at home

* Isolation as a child, being different

* Seeing decline happen (as a child/adult)

* Loyalty to yourself versus loyalty to your parents

* Having (had) to raise yourself

* Taking care of others from a young age

* Shame

* Secrets

* Loneliness, feeling like you came from another world than most kids/people, difficulty relating to ''normal'' people (especially in earlier stages)

* Consequences of abuse etc as an adult

* Adults around the child (such as teachers) noticing that something's going on, but ''blaming'' it on the child, thinking that the child has inherent issues, rather than a disastrous home situation (how that feels, the consequences of that, gaslighting based on it, etc)

* Emotional incest

* Being worried and concerned about your parents (as a child/(young) adult)

* Parents refusing professional help for themselves (or the child)

* Parents taking their issues out on their child

* Crying yourself to sleep

* Deciding what relationship to have with your parents as an adult 

* Mourning what could have been

* Anger over what has been done to you and what has been taken from you

* The role of therapy

* Deep scars and feeling fundamentally branded/stigmatized 

* Learning to properly live with the past

* Processing trauma

* Moving on

* The search for people with similar experiences, seeking recognition and acknowledgement

* Teaching yourself how relationships, life, other people, etc work

* Parents who lie and deny

* Emotionally immature parents

* Suffocating, controlling parents

* Growing up in a filthy hoard

* Coping methods

* Unreasonable parents, hypocrisy, ridiculous/pointless rules, unfair treatment

* Parents who see you as an extension of themselves rather than as a person of your own and who don't respect you as an individual

* Juggling love, hate, hurt, concern and anger

* Parents who're contemptuous

* Slowly realizing as an adult just how bad it was

* Trauma symptoms

She responded quickly, thanked me for being patient and asked “if you agree, we could go to that famous restaurant together and with (a mutual friend)”. 

I told her it sounded good to me and that we’d see eachother at 8pm. 

She then asked me how I was, etc... 

So we went to the restaurant with our friends on Tuesday. She couldn’t stay over at mine because apparently she had to give some blood at 7am and she lives an hour away. 

She told me about her upcoming internship that lasts till December. She said she’s going to be really busy and we won’t be seeing eachother often all. 

I told her I understood and that she should just let me know when she’s free to meet up. 

She kissed me goodbye and left. 


I haven’t heard from her since. 


I’m caught between getting touch with her, or just waiting till she gets in touch - that’s way I will know she’s free and I can just ask her out. 

What do you think?"

**57,802** Gallifreyans *discussing* for **6 years!**  
  
Doctor Who premiered on November 23rd 1963. Initially conceived as an educational programme teaching children about history and science, it was a show about an old man simply called 'the Doctor', his granddaughter, and two of her schoolteachers travelling throughout time and space in a blue box called the TARDIS.  
  
Soon the Doctor's original assistants left and new assistants arrived. After the actor playing the Doctor, William Hartnell, was no longer well enough to play the part, a concept was written into the plot of the show (first called ""renewal"" and later solidified as ""regeneration"") where a dying Time Lord (the Doctor's people) can instead live by regenerating into a new body. Since the Doctor regenerated for the first time in 1966, the show has become very much different than it was when it had premiered in 1963, besides the base concept of being about a person called 'the Doctor'.  
  
With a TV Movie, 840 episodes of the TV show, and almost 55 years of the *Whoniverse* (comics, animation, choose-your-own-adventure books, novels, novelisations, audio dramas, [unlimited rice pudding, et cetera, et cetera](https://youtu.be/IJ-zt-o2mIM?t=169)), Doctor Who is a show full of subject matter for exploration. /r/Gallifrey is a subreddit dedicated to discussions and news for Doctor Who, focused on in-depth discussion which occasionally only makes sense to the most dedicated fans with the most specialized knowledge. However, besides the occasional esoteric thread about the canonicity of the novels or whatever, you don't need to be a level 200 IQ fan for the threads to make sense. Any fan of the show really get into the discussion and exploration of it. There's also a fortnightly [Free Talk Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/9jlzfi/rgallifreys_free_talk_fridays_practically_only/) for random conversation about whatever comes to mind and a weekly [Moronic Monday for 'No Stupid Questions'](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/9kfc2l/rgallifreys_no_stupid_questions_moronic_mondays/).    
  
Now, after another thirteen regenerations since 1966, the new Thirteenth Doctor is premiering today. Even if you haven't watched a second of the last 55 years of Doctor Who, that's fine - this new series is the perfect jumping-on point for possible new fans. It premieres today (October 7th) at 1:45PM ET / 10:45AM PT on BBC America and 6:45 BST on BBC One!

9m5ahf,2,2018-10-07,Plan for college,Huhimmy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9m5ahf/plan_for_college/,"I'm currently a freshman at college majoring in industrial design and living on campus. I know that STEM is where it's at but I don't really have an interest in any of the fields. My goal is to graduate without debt, be employable (have internships done), and if possible have some money saved up.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have $3,600 in the bank and $2k in cash. I'll have to pay around $2-3k a year for college after scholarships and haven't taken out any loans. My parents are supportive but they don't want to pay this. The first semester this year has been fully covered with $500 surplus which I can put into savings I think, but I'm not sure how next semester will be. Here are some expenses I'm worried about.

&amp;#x200B;

**Meal plan**: Right now I have a $1,900 a semester unlimited meal plan which is one of the more expensive ones. It's convenient to not have to worry about food but depending on what my scholarships look like next semester I might switch to a cheaper one. The cheapest is $800 a semester for 5 meals a week. There's a kitchen at my residence building that I can cook in and events that I can get free food at about 1-2 times a week. Worried about how I'll make this work though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Computer**: I have a laptop that works fine for homework and things but I learned from the upperclassmen that I'll need to get a PC for studio next year. You can either pay the school $2k to get the computer for you or get your own. They recommend paying the school because you'll also get all of the 3D modeling/Adobe software that we need for free, whereas with your own computer you'll have to figure out how to get them on your own. I have a year to prepare for this but $2k is steep for me and I was not planning to buy a computer anytime soon. Does this sound like a rip off or not?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping to get a job or internship in the summer. Any financial advice is appreciated.

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. I have the entire long weekend off and want to keep myself entertained! Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M) (Sonic)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama (all characters will be aged up to +18)

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9m78jt,2,2018-10-07,I just found out my long-time crush has started dating someone,PaloPintoTourismBrd,whatsbotheringyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/9m78jt/i_just_found_out_my_longtime_crush_has_started/,"I'm a 26F, in grad school. My crush is another student at the same school.  I knew him as an acquaintance through a shared student organization since early on in school, and I didn't really think much about him one way or the other. But then the summer before last, we ended up doing summer internships in the same city, so we would carpool together to our respective internships every day, and that was the start of us becoming friendly with each other. At one point we carpooled to an interview program happening several hours' drive away, and so we just talked for hours and I just really enjoyed it. He was so easy to talk to, and the time just seemed to fly by. I think it was at that point I started to develop feelings for him.

After that summer, we ended up becoming really good friends. We're involved in a lot of the same organizations, and there's one organization in particular where a group of us often end up hanging out casually outside official events (like getting food together, having game nights, etc). We attend church together every week. We both love board games, so we ended up starting this routine of playing chess together twice a week. I don't have a car, so he's sort of my go-to person who always gives me rides places. He always goes out of his way to help me with things - like helping me move all my stuff from where I was storing it, back into my apartment after this summer ended.

My family's been going through some issues, and I've confided in him about some things I haven't told anyone else. He's been so sympathetic and always makes me feel like he *wants* to hear about it - like he'll ask me how things are going and if everything is ok. A lot of the time it's hard for me to talk about my problems with people, because I feel like they'll see me as whiny or complaining, so that meant a lot to me.

When I first started grad school I struggled a lot to make friends, and I tried to make friends within my first year section, but I felt like people sort of formed up into cliques that I couldn't break into. I went through this period where I felt very lonely and rejected, and like no one thought I was worth having as a friend. Becoming friends with him was sort of an initial step toward me recovering from those feelings. He would seek me out to do things, like play chess - and it was just a massive boost to my self-confidence that someone *wanted* to spend time with me, and would ask me to do things rather than me having to almost beg them to be included. I ended up finding a friend group I fit into after that (so he's not my only friend haha), but that initial boost really helped me get to that point where I felt more worthy of having friends at all.

He is just so sweet, kind, helpful, fun to be around, and intelligent. Since the summer before last, my feelings just kept intensifying as I got to know him, and I ended up with a *massive* crush on him. Honestly I think he's my favorite person, and one of the people I feel closest to, at school.

So today we were talking about what we're doing over fall break, and he mentioned he has plans with this girl he's started dating recently. I managed to keep up a facade of being ok and cheerful while in his presence, but as soon as I got back to my room I just started to cry. I keep thinking about it and crying at random intervals. I feel sort of devastated. I don't know how long this will take to get over. I really, really liked him.

I guess I knew this was coming. This happens whenever I get a crush on someone, so I kind of knew I was on borrowed time before this happened. But it still hurts terribly. I guess it's silly to feel so upset over a crush that didn't go anywhere. I've never been in a relationship before (I've never really had anyone show an interest in me honestly), and I guess I pin too much hope on crushes. Like ""maybe this will be it! Maybe it will be different this time!"" And it hurts so much more this time because we were close friends - generally in the past I've been too shy and have barely talked to my crushes. But this time because we became friends I got much more attached. Way too attached.

Now I have to keep up my friendship with him and pretend it's all fine. It's just going to keep hurting every time I see him. He couldn't tell at all how upset I was, he was so excited to bring his girlfriend to town at some point to meet me and all the other people in our friend group. And I'm excited for him, really. But I just don't know how long it'll be before this hurt goes away.

9m7iv1,2,2018-10-07,There is one thing I never told you,spicylilsamosa,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9m7iv1/there_is_one_thing_i_never_told_you/,"
One thing I even left out of the letters where I told you about what happened during the worst month of my life. One thing I couldn’t even bring myself to day in the update I gave you. It was never a lie- just a truth I chose to omit because I still have trouble bearing it. My life is straight out of a drama or something- because even saying it out loud makes me not believe myself sometimes. But reality is a cruel mistress and I’ve finally broken.

Even now I fear writing about this because only three souls know; which is horrible because you don’t and were such an integral part. By the time it was resolved I just internalized it on my own. You didn’t need to know. Especially when life moves on as if nothing happened. Especially when just knowing it happened would’ve caused you so much stress- you didn’t need it. Even now I doubt you’d care that it ever occurred or you’d use it as fuel to stay further away from me but for some reason I feel the need to write you about it and never send it. I fear you might come across this one day- but the rational part of me knows the odds are so insanely low that it seems like the perfect safe space to should into the void.

 I couldn’t bring myself to tell you at the time- I didn’t want to stress you out. I was going to wait for a gap in your schedule where I had a decent amount of time to work it out with you. Or maybe I would’ve never told you until we actively tried in the future. I never got that choice.

I remember so clearly when I felt off. I took the test and remember every emotion that coursed through my body when I saw those lines appear. The fear, the panic, the hope, the need to run to you even though you were at your internship. You were already stressed. I figured I’d try to piece my own mind together about it before I brought it up to you. That night I went home to you and felt ignored by you and ended up going to bed early. I was bitchy I know. But I remember the tears welling up in my eyes when you crawled in bed afterwards and spooned me with your arm around my waist... and your hand on my stomach. You never knew. I had wondered how in the hell it had happened until it hit me. The day I was taking my cousin to dinner for ramen. It was hard to leave you but you pulled me back to bed and claimed me as yours. One of my first thoughts in the middle of my panic was “my child’s first meal was ramen- how fitting.” A cathartic split moment. I also remember distinctly telling my cousin all about college and becoming an adult and finding yourself. I remember her saying that she wanted something like what I have with you. How morbidly ironic. 

Somehow I became fearless in the next few days- I even mapped out exactly how our conversation should go and what we should talk about. I knew we had already decided a long time ago we’d never keep one this young but part of me also wanted to discuss the possibility of it- no matter how small. I wanted to go over every possibility. It’s all different in theory versus reality. I remember bracing myself because we had talked about how I’d still be very depressed even though keeping one isn’t the best for us. Lesser of two evils maybe?

Then came the reason I never told you. The next week I had my period. Albeit it was extremely heavy and hurt more than usual. I was in shock. I was having a spontaneous abortion. I almost panicked. I later then realized it was out of my control. Nothing could have stopped it; and in reality, did I really want to save it? Who knows? I never got to make that choice.

I remember telling you casually about how so many women happen to have spontaneous abortions and never know because of how soon it happens. We mused about it but moved on quickly to talk about something far more interesting. How morbidly ironic. Last week in genetics we talked about one of many likely reasons why it occurred- all though I’ll never know why for sure.

I wonder all the time what would’ve happened if my body hadn’t failed or the little soul hadn’t ended. Especially now, I wonder if anything would have changed. If they had stuck around would you still be here? You wouldn’t be here for me that’s for sure- it just would have been out of obligation. Or maybe it would’ve United us in a way that brought everything back. But would we have decided to rid ourselves of the burden at such a young age? It’s a strong possibility. It’s most likely what would’ve happened. But it was a choice I never got to make- let alone we got to make. 

Would you have gone with me to the clinic? Would you have held my hand or my body while I cried? Would that have united us? Would it have driven us further apart? Who knows?

I remember thinking about the names we had thought up. How my mom had promised me she would help me out if I ever did follow in her footsteps as a young mother. So many thoughts and memories crowd my mind. The way we’d raise kids- with global mindsets, with a love of science, while also being healthy and active. But you said I’m irrational- that because of my flaws you can’t envision raising children with me anymore. God I’m working so hard on fixing all those problems now with my therapist. Hopefully you’ll see that improvement soon.

But there you have it. I’ve finally put it out there for you to know- although I know you won’t. It feels good even though the weight of it hasn’t been lifted. Maybe one day you’ll get to hear this in person. Maybe you stop never will when we start talking again.

I still love you."
9m7lcl,2,2018-10-07,My Journey,jwash1894,twinflames,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinflames/comments/9m7lcl/my_journey/,"So glad that I found this sub! 

Here's my story(sorry for the long read!) :

We have such a long history with one another, tbh. We’ve never dated in this lifetime at all. I encountered him during my junior year which was the late summer/fall of 2014. I remember seeing him for the first time during our first floor meeting of the year. I told myself that he’d be that guy I’d have a crush on but nothing would ever come out of it. Wow was I wrong! Lol

We lived on the smallest floor of the biggest dorm on campus and he lived a room away from me, so passing one another was very common. He was dating his high school girlfriend,who graduated with me, during that time. I noticed how often he stared at me, but not in a way that made me feel creeped out. He looked at me as if he knew me or was trying to place me. Since we lived on the first floor, we had the gigantic windows and our side of the dorm led to lower campus which was where a lot of student activity was going on(people walking to class, to and from dorms, to the gym, to the cafeteria/bookstore, etc.) and at times when my roommate and I had our blinds open, I’d catch him looking into our room as he was either heading back from somewhere or going to class.

Any time we’d be in the cafeteria and he and his jock friends were sitting in the same area as my friends and I were at, he’d glance all the time, lol. It was cute but there was something oddly comforting and familiar about him and his presence. I was emotionally hung up on a guy that I had no business being hung up on because he hurt me(karmic soulmate). When my feelings for my TF came, something that’s so unlike me, I tried to push them away because they came at such a sketchy time. I also didn’t embrace them at first because he was with someone else.

As the year continued, he continued his staring. At the cafeteria, outside my room every now and then, at a football game, around campus whenever we’d be in the same vicinity, it was a LOT. We had so much tension and looking back, I don’t know how I ‘survived’ it, lol. It often felt as if we were in our little world of stolen glances and that nothing else mattered when they occurred. He entranced me so much and I was so drawn to him that I couldn’t explain it.

As I mentioned before, he never once tried to make a move or talk to me which I respected because it showed me that he is loyal to a fault. Then came his break up with his gf(around Valentine’s Day) and still, he still stared a lot until we were both in the laundry room together(in April) and he asked me if a piece of laundry was mine. Mind you, that piece of laundry had been there for at least a whole month, so I feel that he was trying to break the ice, lol. I nodded no mainly out of nerves because that was the first time he’d ever spoken to me in any way. Then we started having more in person encounters, like he held the door for me like twice on two different occasions.

Then my junior year was winding down and my feelings had really grown and I couldn’t even explain them. So, I decided that I wanted to do something about them. With the help and encouragement of a high school friend, I decided to be bold and introduce myself formally. So, I knocked on his door two times and he wasn’t there either time. Then, I decided to write a note where I basically introduced myself, gave him my number, and asked if we could talk. A friend of mine slid it under his door because I had to go to class, lol.

Since we were Facebook friends prior to sending the note, he messaged me on there and thanked me for the note(when I was in class)but that he was talking to another girl. I just brushed it off and said that that’s of course okay. Then I just wanted to know why he stared all the time and even a friend had noticed it as well by that time. So with the encouragement of a classmate in my next class, I just straight up messaged him and he basically said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” in five different sentences. I just apologized, mainly to save face, but I felt that I was being lied to and I know what I had seen for the past 7 months.

My friend thought that it was weird how he immediately knew who I was on Facebook because he has over 1,000 friends on there, lol. It was close to Finals when that ordeal happened so I was trying to focus my energy on that and show him how unbothered I was even if I felt like he was a LIAR.

That summer came and I had an internship in an nearby city that's close to my alma mater. My feelings intensified instead of evaporating. I actively tried fighting them by purposely thinking of other things whenever the thought of him would come over me. I decided to talk to a psychic and I was vague about my situation and the note. Most picked up on him lying because he was scared because he felt like he got caught. I then settled on the psychic I talk to to this day after she not only said what the others said, but she spoke up about sensing a deep connection between us and that he was scared of it.

She then started talking about a past life we shared where I was a nurse and he was a doctor. I was basically his helper. We had an attraction towards one another and it slowly progressed and we fell in love. She told me that a feminine energy found out that we were secretly seeing each other(in that past life, being with someone of a different religious background was not socially acceptable and he was slightly older than me) and my parents during that time basically exiled me from work.

He wondered where I went and every day after, he anticipated my return. I never came back and he died about 2 years after so the incomplete energy that now resides in my TF now is that energy from then. That’s why he stared at me the way he did because that part of him had recognized my soul, even if our human/egos had trouble deciphering things. Apparently we also were in talks of marriage down the road and opening our own clinic and working alongside one another.

She really helped me understand things better and things she said resonate/resonated with me. She kept telling me that when school started again, we would be in a public but not too crowded space and we would have the opportunity to speak with one another. My senior year came and yes, he still continued his staring , but I went down to the laundry room one day and there he was and it was basically just us as she told me. I had my headphones in and I was so SHOOK, lol. I was so nervous and he was probably just as nervous too so he didn’t bother me or I to him.

There were other opportunities but fear and nervousness always got in the way, seemingly. He wanted to reach out but he always felt that I was trying to actively avoid him. I was just nervous and he got over the note because he knew he wasn’t being honest, according to my psychic.

I graduated in 2016 and my friend saw him. He was a ways away from his normal friend group and my psychic told me that he would come back and he did. She told me that he wanted to open that figurative door and break the ice even if it was just a ‘congratulations!’. She told me that he was watching me/looking for me but we didn’t see each other after the fact.

Flash forward to today, the feelings are still strong and our connection is mad beautiful and reunion will come when it’s supposed to. He’s been casually dating other women but he knows it’s not serious and my psychic said that as time has gone by, he’s really not as fearful of his feelings and knows that I’m that person for him, even more so, and will never that go.

So yeah, that’s the story of us. ❤️

9m7mo6,2,2018-10-07,I just found out my long-time crush has started dating someone,PaloPintoTourismBrd,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9m7mo6/i_just_found_out_my_longtime_crush_has_started/,"I'm a 26F, in grad school. My crush is another student at the same school. I knew him as an acquaintance through a shared student organization since early on in school, and I didn't really think much about him one way or the other. But then the summer before last, we ended up doing summer internships in the same city, so we would carpool together to our respective internships every day, and that was the start of us becoming friendly with each other. At one point we carpooled to an interview program happening several hours' drive away, and so we just talked for hours and I just really enjoyed it. He was so easy to talk to, and the time just seemed to fly by. I think it was at that point I started to develop feelings for him.

After that summer, we ended up becoming really good friends. We're involved in a lot of the same organizations, and there's one organization in particular where a group of us often end up hanging out casually outside official events (like getting food together, having game nights, etc). We attend church together every week. We both love board games, so we ended up starting this routine of playing chess together twice a week. I don't have a car, so he's sort of my go-to person who always gives me rides places. He always goes out of his way to help me with things - like helping me move all my stuff from where I was storing it, back into my apartment after this summer ended.

My family's been going through some issues, and I've confided in him about some things I haven't told anyone else. He's been so sympathetic and always makes me feel like he *wants* to hear about it - like he'll ask me how things are going and if everything is ok. A lot of the time it's hard for me to talk about my problems with people, because I feel like they'll see me as whiny or complaining, so that meant a lot to me.

When I first started grad school I struggled a lot to make friends, and I tried to make friends within my first year section, but I felt like people sort of formed up into cliques that I couldn't break into. I went through this period where I felt very lonely and rejected, and like no one thought I was worth having as a friend. Becoming friends with him was sort of an initial step toward me recovering from those feelings. He would seek me out to do things, like play chess - and it was just a massive boost to my self-confidence that someone *wanted* to spend time with me, and would ask me to do things rather than me having to almost beg them to be included. I ended up finding a larger friend group I fit into after that, but that initial boost really helped me get to that point where I felt more worthy of having friends at all.

He is just so sweet, kind, helpful, fun to be around, and intelligent. Since the summer before last, my feelings just kept intensifying as I got to know him, and I ended up with a *massive* crush on him. Honestly I think he's my favorite person, and one of the people I feel closest to, at grad school.

So today we were talking about what we're doing over fall break, and he mentioned he has plans with this girl he's started dating recently. I managed to keep up a facade of being ok and cheerful while in his presence, but as soon as I got back to my room I just started to cry. I keep thinking about it and crying at random intervals. I feel sort of devastated. I don't know how long this will take to get over. I really, really liked him.

I guess I knew this was coming. This happens whenever I get a crush on someone, so I kind of knew I was on borrowed time before this happened. But it still hurts terribly. I guess it's silly to feel so upset over a crush that didn't go anywhere. I've never been in a relationship before (I've never really had anyone show an interest in me honestly), and I guess I pin too much hope on crushes. Like ""maybe this will be it! Maybe it will be different this time!"" And then I've been single so long I always think it might be my last chance. And it hurts so much more this time because we were close friends - generally in the past I've been too shy and have barely talked to my crushes. But this time because we became friends I got much more attached. Way too attached.

Now I have to keep up my friendship with him and pretend it's all fine. It's just going to keep hurting every time I see him. He couldn't tell at all how upset I was, he was so excited to bring his girlfriend to town at some point to meet me and all the other people in our friend group. And I'm excited for him, really. But I just don't know how long it'll be before this hurt goes away."
9m7q0w,217,2018-10-07,I ruined an ex-boyfriend’s car with skunk oil after discovering he was engaged and I was his side piece,mishmellow462,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9m7q0w/i_ruined_an_exboyfriends_car_with_skunk_oil_after/,"I was a naive 20 year old virgin when I met “Chris”, who was a few years older. He was so sweet and charming, and pretty soon we were dating. I knew he traveled a lot for his job, so I wasn’t too suspicious when he had to be gone most weekends. He always called me when he was on these business trips, and gave me no reason to doubt him.  

I lost my virginity to him about three months into our relationship, after we had already started saying “I love you”, and after six months, he was even talking about marrying me someday. I was head over heels in love, but one evening, we ran into an older man Chris worked with, and the guy said to me “Oh, you must be Melissa! Chris talks about you all the time!” Chris’s face went white, and he quickly told the guy my name was ———.  When we got to the car, I asked him who Melissa was, and he said she was his ex-gf, but the way he said it, I could tell he was lying. 

After a bit of digging, my roommate/best friend and I discovered Melissa was actually Chris’s fiancée, they had been high school sweethearts, and their wedding was coming up very soon. When I confronted Chris, he admitted it was true. They were engaged, Melissa was living in another city because she’d gotten a job there out if college, and his “business trips” were to go see her. He begged me not to tell her, because she was pregnant, and he was still planning on marrying her. I was devastated, naturally, but I kept my composure and told him I wouldn’t tell Melissa. Even after this, he kept calling me, asking me to come over. It was like salt in the wound every time I would hear his voice on my voicemail (this was before texting was really a thing). I never returned his calls, but I can’t say the temptation wasn’t there. 

Then I found out through someone he worked with that I wasn’t the only one Chris was cheating with. He was also having sex with a 17 yr old high school girl who worked as an intern in his office. At that point, I wasn’t hurt, I was pissed.

A few weeks later, my best friend came home with a small bottle of something called “skunk essence” and a needle/syringe she’d snagged from a diabetic she knew, and she said she had a plan. That night, we went to Chris’s apartment and injected skunk essence (which is really foul stuff, btw) into Chris’s car. We injected it inside the doors, into the vents behind the hood, onto the undercarriage... pretty much everywhere we could get it. The car was ruined, because no amount of cleaning would completely get that smell out of the air vents. 

I don’t regret what I did at all. If I’d known what kind of car he bought after getting rid of the skunk wagon, I would have skunked that one, too. 

Edit: Oh, and Melissa was not pregnant. Yet another lie. He was just a piece of shit all the way around. "

9makq5,3,2018-10-07,Feeling Discouraged,yeetyaw61197,LSAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/9makq5/feeling_discouraged/,"Hey everyone, so i've been studying for the LSAT since May though I had a lot going on this summer with internships so have been honestly more intensely studying since August.. i took the july and september tests &amp; in retrospect, I was not ready for either. I've wanted more than anything to apply this cycle and have registered for Nov, but I can't seem to get my score up (hovering in the low 150's). I'm working my ass up to get this up, but am starting to question how realistic I'm being. Of course, my test date can still be changed to January. Honestly, unless I get a 160+ i can't see myself getting into most of the schools I have my eye set on (unless i just go for location and transfer) which I haven't ruled out. Part of me is starting to wonder if I'm rushing this process right out of undergrad and would be more prepared for next cycle. &amp; part of me is scared I won't be able to get my score up regardless. Have I set an unrealistic time frame for this test? I think I could honestly get logic games down to (-3) in the next month or so. I've also had a RC breakthrough (-7) on my last timed section. LR seems to still be a huge struggle for me (about -11 averaging both sections). I also feel like I'm just in my head a lot with those sections which is preventing me from doing better because I do much better untimed. I'm honestly feeling depressed about my next move. Applying next cycle has never even been a passing thought until now &amp; its likely my undergrad gpa won't change much. Do I rule out the January test for this cycle of admissions? Is my score goal unrealistic? Need advice :/ "
9map4h,3,2018-10-07,Advice for grad school applications? How are my chances?,djsnipy,compling,https://www.reddit.com/r/compling/comments/9map4h/advice_for_grad_school_applications_how_are_my/,"Hello, I'm a senior undergrad and I'm a double major in linguistics and computer science and I'll be applying for grad school in computational linguistics. I was wondering if I could ask for some advice and if anybody could tell me what they think of my application.

Some schools I have in mind are Carnegie Mellon, UPitt, UC Boulder, and University of Rochester, Syracuse, Stony Brook, among others. Some that don't require GRE scores are Washington and Arizona. I'd say my top 2 are Washington and Carnegie Mellon.

Some potential **strong points** of my application I think would be :

* I have a 3.82 GPA overall

* I have 2 relevant undergraduate work/research experiences,  both of which dealt with processing natural language. One was a text mining internship in Germany and the other was parsing Russian court documents. I think I can get good recommendations from my supervisors on these projects.

* Besides work and research experiences, I have some other class projects with linguistics. One was a class project on an endangered language in Italy where I added information to Wikipedia for the language and used sources mostly in German and Italian. Another was making digital learning materials for a local native american language revitalization program.

* I'm certified as a C1 speaker in German and Russian and have varying experience in some other languages like Italian and Chinese (though not certified). Almost all of my language knowledge is self taught.

As for potential **weak points**:

* I took the GRE in the beginning of September and scored 164v, 156q, and 4.5 essay. I think the time pressure really hurt my math score. I was aiming for 160+ which is usually what the top schools have as their averages.

* My projects/work experiences didn't heavily use NLP algorithms. I used some algorithms but mostly worked with regular expressions, parsing, cleaning data, using keywords etc. I don't really think this would be too concerning though since the whole point is that I'm applying to programs so that I can learn more but I would feel intimidated by undergrads who have direct experience working with machine learning algorithms, for example. I had considered using some in my work but the work never really required it.




Is there anything you'd recommend highlighting? Any advice? Is there anything you wish you did when you were applying? 

Thanks!

Edit: to clarify, I'm applying for a master's not a phd"

I can honestly see how it pretty much derailed my life by not getting into college  (was going to USC and blew it by basically not even thinking about school all senior year) and losing a girl that I still think about today (almost 2 years later).  I went to CC a couple of times but it didn't really work out.  Passed most of my classes but failed 3 over the two semesters i went and it just got me down because I know I'm capable of getting an A in really any class at any school if I actually put my mind to it and it just made me feel really dumb, so I decided not to enroll next semester and just work at the local golf corse and surf and work until I figure things out. Also landed a 7th month internship at a recording studio in Hollywood after my first semester CC with great connections that I could've totally utilized had I done well in school so thats totally squandered. In this 2 and a half year span of smoking everyday I have experimented with a lot of drugs ex: acid, shrooms, coke the whole shah bam. Pretty much anything except heroin, meth, or crack. Although I haven't been taking any of these drugs regularly I can definitely see how it has straight up impaired my brain. Nothing too serious but have definitely gotten worse at communicating ideas and other basic shit like that.  The worst part is that all this is clear as day to me (some of my friends aren't so lucky) and I just can't seem to care about myself enough to stop the humdrum. Like I think all these things everyday and I just don't see a point in doing anything at this point like it feels like just I've already lost the fight.  I have also struggled with severe depression since I was in elementary school so my brain just doesn't even value getting better like others probably do so I think thats whats causing the conundrum going on in my head . I know I will never be homeless, but at this rate I also know I will never see any sort of success either. It's honestly the hardest thing in the world to accept that I wont be able to give back to my kids or your grandkids the way I am going to want to when I'm older. There is a part of me that wants to get better and put in real fight for my future family and see what happens but there is another part that honestly loves smoking and surfing all the time and listening to music and just being a shit head. Not really too sure on what to do at this crossroads. /:"
9mbd48,2,2018-10-07,F4A - I want my hometown to be a character!,2018courage,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9mbd48/f4a_i_want_my_hometown_to_be_a_character/,"Hi! I've been thinking for a while about how to write this prompt, and I wanted to get it out there to see if I can connect with someone on it! I'm worried this will end up being too specific/exclusive for many people, so read the last paragraph if you feel that way!

If you read my post history, you'll see that I'm from Washington, DC. I'm really proud to call such a transient city home, and going to college this close to where I grew up was a great decision. Today, I want to find someone to write a story with who can help me make this amazing town a character, somewhere that feels as real as it is to me every day. I'm hoping to use specific places as settings, and have our characters behave like locals here do.

Because I'm so dedicated to the setting of the story, the plot is something I'm still undecided on. Are we lobbying interns meeting at our bosses' cocktail hour at the Watergate? Are you my intern coordinator, taking me to Eastern Market to socialize after work? Are we long-suffering Nats fans meeting at an open air bar before a game? Maybe you have another idea completely! I'm open to a lot of ideas, as long as we can set them somewhere that feels authentic to DC. We'll definitely discuss our plot and content before we start off.

**If you feel like this is too detailed about a place you've never been, no worries! I'd love to talk about any DPP prompt I've posted before.** Either way, send me a couple options for what you want me to look like so I know you read my whole prompt! Hope to hear from you!"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sitting here, in between watching stock market news, procrastinating studying, and thinking about life. This post is more about solidifying my thoughts while allowing people to share in my musings.

As I thought, I realize that **i now treat life as a video game.** Complete with the grinds, the instances, and the raiding. I am where I am because I took the **positive lessons from gaming, and didn't let the addiction swallow me**.

To preface, I am currently in law school at an ABA accredited school. It's not an ivy league or an upper tier, but it is one of only two good schools in my city where I plan to live for the foreseeable future. I have an internship at the public defenders office which pays work-study wages, and have lined up internships at the city attorney (where i want to end up), and a superior court clerkship.  I have 5k in stocks, 10k in my roth IRA, and a fantastic credit score with 5 credit cards. It took me 30 years to get here. This is my story.

&amp;#x200B;

**The beginning:**

I did not start this way. Gaming destroyed my college years. I graduated High-school with mediocre grades and great SAT scores because I had always been a lazy fuck with good test taking skills. I made it into university, but then **I dropped out because I was too busy playing games.** I was amazing at them. I played WoW, Dota, League, DayZ, Starcraft, Eve. You name the big names, i played them, and I was fucking good. I carried, I bragged about my raiding stats, I made diamond in both Starcraft and League. But each time the game ended. I grew bored and every time i switched games, I had nothing to show for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Complacency:**

I lived with my parents. I had a few cute girlfriends. I was always able to hold a job. It helps that I am an extrovert who isn't ugly. It was shallow. The relationships ended the same way; I had no real confidence, no ambition. Eventually my days were wake up, go to work, get home, play games, sleep, rinse/repeat. I grew fat. Too fat to get a girlfriend off my shallow ambitions anymore. I racked up 10k in credit card debt. I had some bad breakups. Considered suicide but I was too much of a wimp and deep down I knew I didn't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

T**urnaround:**

Eventually, I realized ""this fucking sucks."" I didn't turn it around instantly though. I went to community college. Still played games, but less. It took me another 6 years to finally finish my bachelors at 27. My graduation picture is me at my heaviest weight. Still depressed. I graduated without a goal. But it at least gave me the push I needed.

**This is when my mindset changed.** I said ""enough is enough.""

I used my history of gaming and applied it to real life. The most important thing is to **FIND SOMETHING YOU LOVE.** I don't care if its being a nurse, a doctor, a photographer, or a secretary. To do this, I've applied a few rules.

1. **Games have a raiding goal.** Every game has one. For me, its Trial. Standing in front of a judge or jury gives me a huge rush. I love doing opening statements, closing, convincing people. These are my raids, and the reason I go to school. For doctors/nurses it can be the process of diagnosing/saving a life. Photographers its the big wedding shoot. Whatever it is, YOU NEED A RAID. You need something that gives you that rush. Because if you don't have this, you might as well become another faceless 9-5 cubicle in the sea of mediocrity.
2. **WoW taught me how to grind**. Grinding sucks. Some people like it, but its the GOAL AT THE END which makes it enjoyable. I fucking hate studying. But every time I do it I remember the rush I get from trial. This gives me the motivation I need. Discipline is how I remember. Nobody is going to hire a level 50 law student who is in shitty blue gear to end game content. It sucks, but if you have the raiding goal in mind, its easier.
3. **Eve gave me market experience.** Eve online is a space sim with a HUGE player driven market. Its reflective of how real life economies work. The one thing I noted playing eve was that everyone was short term. Grind some money, blow up some ships, rinse repeat. EVERYONE COMPLAINED ABOUT MONEY. But the real moneymakers were the traders, the leaders, and the long time players. All the rich players had something in common: they all have a source of passive income, or a huge bank of assets from playing so long. CEO's or alliance leaders (successful ones) didn't worry about money, their alliances/corporations made it for them, and they managed the assets. Additionally, they invested their cash in assets. The more assets you have, the easier it is to make money off them. SO SAVE. DON'T INVEST IN LIQUID ASSETS (cash). Put your money to work. Whether it's stocks, bonds, IRA's, real estate, park your money somewhere, and save every month.
4. **DayZ and League taught me to accept loss.** Survival games are brutal. League can be toxic. But being a part of these communities has taught me how to handle loss better than most people. Even eve is pretty heart-wrenching when you get 100 million assets blown up because of a tiny mistake. But all of these games taught me HOW NOT TO DWELL on losses or mistakes. Dozens of hours of work can be wiped out in a heartbeat. The true nature of people can be vicious. Games have taught me how to GET OVER IT and start again. This has been crucial in my journey back to success.
5. **Starcraft taught me about momentum and timing.** In starcraft, build order is CRUCIAL. 1 extra worker in the beginning translates into 1000 extra minerals down the line. Learn how to do things efficiently, don't just jump in and hope for the best. Tiny advantages turn into huge payoffs, but it doesn't end there. Starcraft taught me to start fast, early, and hard, but all your advantages can still get wiped out if you get complacent. Momentum is extremely important because once it builds, its unstoppable, but the moment you get lazy, you'll get smashed. Dont get complacent, learn the RIGHT way to build, and don't ease up until the game is won.
6. **KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.** Every single game you play, the best players are the most experienced. Education is critical because it can NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY. Video games are no different. In DayZ, getting killed sucks, but every death gives you better map knowledge, mechanics basics, and awareness. Your first geared character takes weeks, your second, third, fourth takes days, hours. In Eve your ships geting blown up teaches you which routes to avoid, how to not autopilot with 500million in your cargohold. In WoW every wipe teaches you the mechanics of the boss, how to play your class.

&amp;#x200B;

I've taken each of these lessons and used it to be successful. Trial is my end game, those are my raids. Law school is how I grind the levels out to get there, internships are how i get the gear I need. Eve showed me that even with raiding experience, I need to fund my activities somehow. Passive income; Assets; INVEST YOUR MONEY. DayZ lets me accept loss or failure. It took me 9 years longer, but that's 9 years of experience I gained about how NOT to fuck up. I know that this momentum is important, and all the knowledge I've gained so far can never be taken away.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how I used gaming to turn my life around. I hope you learn something too."
9mbigo,3,2018-10-07,[M4F] That New Government Program,dare-2-bare,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9mbigo/m4f_that_new_government_program/,"I had only just started at the college having completed the induction week before beginning the three year course in Business Studies. Not the most exciting profession but I thought it would give me a good grounding to keep my career options open.

Walking into my first seminar of the day, I'm greeted by the lecturer, a jaded looking guy in a demure shirt and trousers who hands me a note. I notice that it has a copy of my access card photo on it, it must have been for the lecturer to identify me by. Reading the note, it simply says 'Hello James, please proceed to the Dean's office in the campus administration building'.

I look up at the lecturer but he has already switched his attention to the rest of the class already taking their seats. Maybe there's an issue with the disbursement of my loan for the tuition fees or a change to one of the modules I signed up for, different issues and scenarios running through my mind as I make my way across the lawn in front of the imposing admin building. After getting directions from the girl on the front desk, obviously an intern working for minimum wage, I make my way along the almost deserted but brightly lit corridor until I find the dark solid wood door with the word DEAN in capital letters on a brass placard. My knuckles wrap with a deep knock before I hear ""come in"".

Stepping into the ornate room, lavishly decorated with dark wood, certificates, pictures, accolades and book cases lining the wall, my attention is first drawn to the Dean sitting behind a desk that looks like it could have been there since the inception of the college itself. She looks to be maybe 50-something, dressed in a sharp pin-striped suit, glasses delicately resting on her seasoned face, her eyes studying me with a look of intrigue, indifference and purpose. ""Please James, take a seat"", your hand gesturing to one of the leather chesterfield chairs across from her.

I'd already noticed when I came in that I hadn't been the only one summoned but it's not until I take my seat that I look over to you, your slender figure comfortably supported in the chair, cute, delicate features framed by long nourished hair that cascades over your shoulders. The look in your eyes as they silently connect with mine, searching with the same curiosity tells me that you have no idea what this is about either.

""We've had a change in policy for the college,"" the Dean started to explain, removing her glasses and placing them on the polished table before her. ""We're going to pick a couple of students each week. Here, this will explain further."" Opening a paper file that until now I hadn't noticed, she extracted a couple of pamphlets and handed one to each of us.

At that moment, we could have been the only ones in the room, the world falling away around us, as we carefully studied the material. Embossed with a glossy finish, the front cover had a picture of a nude man and woman on it.

""You can review that later,"" she told us, both of us looking at one another, searching for some kind of indication that at least one of us understood what was going on. ""It explains a new program we have, where we will select a couple of students each week to attend college in the nude. It's a program being pioneered by the government to tackle body dysmorphia and the attitudes of young people such as yourselves in accepting their bodies. This college is the first to undertake this program. You have both been selected at random and you will not be permitted to wear any clothing this week during college hours, except shoes and socks if you wish. Could you please undress now?""

You looked at us both so matter-of-factly, no hesitation or uncertainty in your voice and a look of impatience on your face, as though to ask what the delay was for and to get on with it so that other more important matters could be attended to.

You were the first to speak up ""I'm sorry what???!"" your eyes wide with disbelief and shock. ""With all due respect, you've got to be out of your mind if you think i'm going to take my clothes off and walk around campus in front of everyone."" crossing your arms in front of your chest defensively.

""Miss Samantha"" started the Dean, her now fierce eyes also turning to me ""and this goes for you too Mr James, this is a mandatory program, instructed by the government and if you do not cooperate, you will be removed from this institution with a note on your permanent record that will remain for the rest of your life. You have 2 minutes as of now.""

I could see the tears already gathering at your eye liner topped dams. Turning to me, fear and panic strewn across your face, ""I don't know you James but you this is insane right? I mean they can't force us!"" Your deep enticing eyes are wide open, burning a hole through me, seeking a response that doesn't exist.

""One minute"" the Dean said, resolute in her demand.

My mind was a mess right now. I definitely couldn't have even dreamt this up if I had tried with the scenarios I played through my head on the way here. Naked for the whole week. I couldn't even get my head around that statement. ""What choice do we have? We lose our places and careers and it's on our permanent record for the rest of our lives"", angry tears now rolling down your delicate cheeks trying to accept our fate.

Placing the pamphlet on the desk I pull my t-shirt over my head exposing my toned youthful torso. ""What the fuck are you doing??"" You say, completely disregarding the fact we're still in the Dean's office.

""You'd do well to follow Mr Jame's lead Miss Samantha. He obviously understands the value of education at this institution"", a sly grin of satisfaction creeping into the edges of her pursed lips, the obvious power trip playing out in her steely eyes.

I unzipped my bag ready to place my clothes in before the Dean interrupted. ""Oh you'll have to leave your clothes here, we can't risk you putting them back on the moment you step out of the door"" as she gestured towards two cardboard boxes placed against the wall to our right, our names taped to them on pieces of white paper.

I could feel your eyes silently following me as I rose from the chair, the aged chesterfield creaking with the relief from my weight, taking the couple of steps on the plush carpet needed to stand in front of my box. Dropping my t-shirt in, I popped the button on my jeans, releasing the zip and taking a deep breath, lowered them to the floor, stepping out of each leg independently before they joined my t-shirt in the box. I stood there in a pair of socks which looked kind of ridiculous and were quickly removed, my boxers the only item of clothing left on my body. The room was deafly silent, so much so that I could swear that you could hear my heart thumping through my chest.

""James.... you can't? You're really going to...."" The tears didn't seem to be falling anymore, your attention captivated by my submission. The words reverberated in my head again, what choice do I have? I closed by eyes, took another deep breath and hooked my thumbs into the elasticated waistband, hesitating slightly before liberating the final item of clothing from my body as I stood there defeated and naked with my back to both of you. Throwing them in with the rest of my clothing there was nothing left for me to do but turn around and return to my seat, giving you both a full unobstructed view of my member as it hung loosely between my legs, the hair around the top trimmed neatly and as far as you could see, seemingly smooth along the shaft and below. I could see your eyes following it as I took my place back at my seat, resolved to my fate, the still warm cushion now welcoming back every inch of my exposed skin.

""It seems that it's your turn Miss Samantha. Mr James has already demonstrated what it means to be a part of the community at this college""

""You won't get away with this"" you hiss scathingly at the Dean, only serving to amuse her it seems as she smiles back at you. I watch as you angrily pace over to the box and without any measure of finesse or femininity as you start to remove your clothing, throwing each item with a demonstrated reluctance until you're standing there in a matching black pair of underwear, the french knickers perfectly accentuating the taught curvature of your toned ass. With your back to us, I watch as your hands move to the the clasp on your bra, releasing it in one smooth motion, a skill I felt should be taught to guys in school! I watch as the straps roll down your outstretched slender arms, dropping directly into the box in front of you. Your head turns, your eyes thin and angry as you look at the Dean, her expression blank but seemingly enjoying her position of power. I hear you utter 'bitch' under your breath as you quickly pull down the delicate underwear, bending at the waist as you do so and giving me a perfect view of the smooth orbs perched at the top of your toned and now bare thighs and just the briefest glimpse of the smooth lips nestled in the gap between them.

This time my eyes follow you as you cross your arms in front of you, trying to preserve some sense of dignity and modesty but all the same I can see the definition of your torso leading down to a neatly trimmed, barely there thin strip accenting the start of where every guy and probably even some girls, would love to be. Despite the obstruction I can see the pert rise of your chest and I would guess probably somewhere between a B and a C cup. Despite my predicament, I can feel a familiar stirring happening between my legs and I pray that the feeling will go away!

""Good, I'm glad we got over that. Now, there are some rules which you must follow. All of the staff here have been briefed to enforce them and failure to do so will result in a punishment. If you continue to resist the program, you will be automatically expelled. Nod if you understand."" We both nodded, relenting to the situation. ""Excellent, now we have re-arranged your timetables so that you are in the same classes without disturbing your programs. You are not permitted to cover yourselves in any way, effective immediately"", her instruction unquestionably aimed at your still crossed arms. She paused until you rolled your eyes, repositioning your arms on the chair rests and revealing two amazingly pert breasts accented by a pair of perfectly proportioned little pink buds. The stirring between my legs continued as I tried to divert my attention back to the instructions being given. ""You will go about your days as usual and you will allow people to take pictures if they request them. After all, we are promoting positive body image here. As part of the program, you are also permitted"" there was a pause as she examined her copy of the pamphlet, ""actually you are encouraged to engage in any sexual activity on campus at any time or place you desire, class time included. However, this is only allowed to happen between the two of you only."" Her eyes coming back to meet both of ours.

It couldn't be helped and with our current state of undress, as well as the persistent mention of sex, my member had grown to its fullest and proudest state as it throbbed between my legs, protruding eagerly towards the underside of the desk in front of us, its pulsing presence impossible to miss. I try to calm my breathing but I know that it hasn't escaped the attention of your eyes and I'm starting to wonder how I'm supposed to leave the room, never mind go about the rest of the day, especially if i'm going to be paired with your stunning naked body for the duration. At least the other guys will be able to hide their lustful appreciation!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, I'll leave it there but I think you can see where i'm going with this. Perhaps you feel disgusted, angry, ashamed or embarrassed about it all but does all the attention start to have an unexpected effect, as well as the opportunity to tease me back into my current state in front of everyone?"
9mbja5,11,2018-10-07,"Warning if you do feel like reaching out, even with circumstances favoring you",dsong_,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/9mbja5/warning_if_you_do_feel_like_reaching_out_even/,"Here's my story:

My first relationship - and first breakup was fairly okay in terms of circumstances. We lasted a bit over a year. No cheating, no abuse, just a matter of me fighting a losing battle for months when her heart wasn't in it anymore. We had a mini-break up one evening after a tough 1-week break period before our real separation. My ex tearfully told me it's been a privilege to be with me and she hasn't grown as much as she has with anyone else during our time together. She lamented we never had the chance to be friends and would've really appreciated that - though emphasising I had no obligation to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't the best night of my life when I pleaded with her to come back and try to understand why it all happened the day after, which only led her to highlight the differences she perceived and incompatibility. Despite our scuffle I did console her that she'd always have  a place in my heart as my first love and she made the right decision that I would've done under those circumstances. She was still disheartened to see me unwell but was comforted by my words. We still held hands together as we were driven back, I don't know who reached but she responded 'we were still close'. I messaged her later I had to cut her out of my life and she wished me all the best.

&amp;#x200B;

What follows is me being confusing and random by reaching out. At work I ran by her and told her to 'stay strong', she was pleasantly surprised by this and began to start small talk in a warm and friendly manner. I was of course confused at what I was doing so I told her to we shouldn't be talking at work, which just hurt her. So yeah, **even if they care about you, do not reach out because you risk stupid stuff like this happening and more pain for the both of you**. That situation at least was cleared up and we reinforced that we were still important to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

A week later I met up with her as before I saw a uni counsellor for my problems. She has had experience with them before so I wanted her to be with me. We sat at the place I first confessed to her and there were good vibes. I declared that I wanted to be friends with what I thought was a clear head and genuine heart - because getting back together was pretty much unfeasible I recognised. Whilst she did say our separation wasn't set in stone and no one knows what the future holds, I tried not to fixate on that. My ex was moved by my desire to stay friends and understood my need for space and no-contact - we departed with hugs and smiles over each other's shoulders.

&amp;#x200B;

She dropped me off my birthday present at work a week later and a heartfelt letter telling me how grateful she was for the relationship, thanking me for being such a loving and dedicated partner, and that she missed me dearly and hoped we could connect in the near future. Mixed reactions toward that but I appreciated the gesture overall. After that started the NC.

&amp;#x200B;

A month passed with its ups and downs as normal, but progress was there. I got an internship, hammered out my studies and continued to exercise. Even with the clarity of the relationship and its problems I still felt the desire to try again. However I was also reading how-to-get-your-ex-back guides on the side which held back my healing and prevented me from letting go. **Stay away from these get-your-ex-back guides.** Some of them are innocuous, whilst others are downright deceitful and manipulative. Whatever the case,  **they suck you into that false hope.**

&amp;#x200B;

After a month I cracked under the pressure. I wanted to gauge how I felt and figured that if I can't deal with the consequences of chatting to her like a normal person, I may as well give up on life. I thought she would welcome me back with open arms. I asked her what she was doing after work - immediately suggesting I wanted to meet. We couldn't meet but she told me she's available to chat later. We had a phone call where she was neither really warm nor cold. She was joyous to hear about my internship and we caught up a bit. Now by no means was I expecting anything more than a friendly conversation, but I did envision a more positive reception. Also she did respond that the guy she was previously interested in before meeting me, was in a group outing with her and other friends. This rang all sorts of alarm bells in my head but I held back enough to not dig deeper. I was still a bit stunned as we hung up.

&amp;#x200B;

The following days felt like the beginning of the breakup all over again. I didn't get the reception I expected when really, it was just a neutral and friendly phone call. Without overthinking the interaction, it honestly was probably just her being busy with work and assessments, unavailable to meet and caught off-guard by me so she was on the defensive. Or maybe she doesn't care too much now despite the letter. Either way, it doesn't matter.  I was determined not to undo the progress I had made from that month but it was crushing. Even if no progress was really undone I was pretty set back or slowed down heavily.

&amp;#x200B;

I do tell myself that I would've reached out sooner or later anyway because I wasn't fully letting her go despite NC. But my point still stands, **emotions are unpredictable, people are unpredictable,** and the only constant in no-contact is that if you **literally do nothing, nothing can get worse**, which means **things incidentally get better.** Even if you both still want to keep things friendly, you have to keep in mind that the person you talk to is also affected in a storm of emotions and possibly could be a different person than before. I had all these circumstances of a genuinely good and understanding partner, amicable break-up and a neutral outlook on the relationship supposedly favouring me but it didn't do me any good in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

The benefit I can see in my mistake is that I can share it with you all the consequences of slipping, even just a bit - and that I must truly let go to avoid any mishaps. I'm backing out with NC until I'm 110% recovered and/or she reaches out. Be careful and stay strong my friends."

Theme: Career Services

I probably should have posted these resources before the career fair, but they are still important and can prepare you for the career fairs in the Spring or the STEM (non engineering) Career Fair in October.   
TigerLink  
TigerLink is your first stop for finding your future career or internship. Job postings, that aren’t necessarily found on normal job sites, but are  available to apply for. This online suite also allows you to upload your resume to the UofM resume book, which is later put in the resume book for your college. From there, when companies  look for new hires, your resume will be available to view and they may reach out to you personally. Note, your resume must be “Tiger Ready” before it will be submitted. Once you uploaded your resume, Career Services will reach out to you and either approve your resume or deny it and give you pointers on how to approve it.   
TigerZone  
This website keeps you informed of all events happening on campus. Whether it’s a job fair, organization event, or a SAC event TigerZone will keep you updated. (This is also where I get the majority of my event news.) If you go to your profile in the upper right corner and click event pass, you take a snapshot or save your event pass to your wallet, making it easier to get into events.   
Tiger Suit Up  
Tiger Suit Up allows students who are financially challenged (receiving the Pell Grant) to get suited up for a career fair, interview, job, or internship. Students must fill out an application found (here), and meet the requirements (usually attending 2 on campus events). Selected applicants will be driven to JCP via UofM shuttle and be gifted a $150 JCP card and a 40% coupon. JCP stylists will also work personally with each student and ensure they are career ready. Note, you must ride with the UofM shuttle and the shuttle picks up at 7am on a Saturday. There will be at least one more session this year, so apply! I was selected earlier in the year, so I can answer any questions you may have.

It's almost been two years (!) but it still stings when I see her face or hear her name. Today, I made the mistake of checking out her Facebook profile for the first time in more than a year or so.   


Well, let's just say that she's far, far from the screaming, abusive, narcissist person who I left all that time back. She's living in Paris and really living it up, as they say. Fancy, glamorous pictures (with the guy she cheated on me, btw), in even fancier locations all over the France and Europe. Money was never a problem for her (her dad's a Fortune 500 CEO) but it seems like she's really starting to spend it lol. The reason I mention this is that she's technically still a student (as was I) so it seems a little strange to me.   


In addition, she's also doing great professionally. She's got an internship at one of the biggest banks of the city (something which virtually guarantees you a job when you graduate). She also started a new college group at her university and passed the CFA level 1 exam with flying colors. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I know that life is not a competition and it's silly to get worked up over this. Yet, it's just that for all the progress that I've (seemingly) made, it seems like I have nothing to show for it. I am so much more fitter, happier, and mature than I was two years back. But I'm not the type to brag about it on social media or make my posts public (as she's done, she's not my FB friend). I also did a long internship in Copenhagen and got great reviews from my boss(es). Granted, it's not as glamorous as Paris and I look like a moron in pictures, but it was a great experience. I've come back home now, since I only had a temporary contract.   


This is where the problem lies for me.. I know I didn't fail, but coming back to my hometown while she gallivants around Europe with her fancy job and boyfriend make me feel like crap. 

  
In addition , what bothers me is that she often used to say stuff like this when we were together in university -   
1) ""you're one of the stupidest people I've ever met""  
2) ""you do nothing all day but sit on your ass""  
3) ""your parents are old and don't know shit about how they should raise their children, and hence they raised a moron like you""  


Objectively, it wasn't true.  It seemed like she had a superiority complex over me or something like that. I had better grades, more achievements, awards, you name it. I played sports, was in the orchestra, had my own band, etc. Yet, all these thing REALLY hurt. They still do.   


Now, because of her 'other worldly' achievements, it seems like her words were true, you know? Maybe I wasn't 'good enough' for her. She often used to joke saying that she only dated me for my looks but now it seems like that's what it was. Trust me, that's not a good feeling at all.   


I just feel like shit, honestly. Coming back home has been like the biggest anti-climax of my life and this shit doesn't help. Would you guys have any advice for me? Other than to not check her profile (lol)   
I would really, really appreciate it. Thank you.

but I still feel hollow somehow. Almost as if I'm not allowed to regret my past actions and not having the courage to reach out as I'm terrified that the current me won't be, or ever will be, enough. 

The only person I could trust with my secrets/heart was my older sister who was like a 2nd mother to me, and since her passing 3 years ago, I just don't see the reason for wanting to interact. Even on my medication, I don't have the energy to leave my room still. 
My valid excuses can be is that I work part-time, have school, *and* an internship to complete so I don't really have the time to go out, but it doesn't feel right. 

My part-time job has me working overnights, so when I have customers **(late teens to early 20s)** coming in groups, laughing loudly and just having fun, I get irritated. Or is it envy? I think to myself *""what gives you the right to be so happy when I'm here shut up in my own head?""* to *""that could be me, laughing and having fun, if I just tried harder.""* 

But I can't just turn off my crippling anxiety, introversion, and fear of rejection like a switch. I have no desire to get wasted, smoke, or high, or be someone I'm not just to *""fit in.""* It doesn't work like that. And maybe its for the best."

I had my first day of uni this semester, but we didn't really start learning new things yet. Also I'll start my new job next week. I did not have any symptoms since april, I'm stable and I can concentrate well. And my new social worker is helping me very well.

How about you? Hope you're doing well."

_Democrat staffer and doxxer Jackson Cosko_

### **Last Wednesday,[ Capitol Police arrested 27-year-old Jackson Cosko](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/10/breaking-capitol-police-arrest-27-year-old-jackson-cosko-for-doxxing-3-gop-senators/) of DC for “allegedly posted private, identifying information (doxxing) about one or more United States Senators.”**

But it was worse than we thought.

Accused doxxer 27-year-old Jackson Cosko [threatened to leak](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/10/just-in-doxxer-jackson-cosko-threatened-to-leak-gop-senators-childrens-health-information/) Republican Senators’ children’s health information if any witnesses dared go to the authorities about his criminal activities.

**But now there are questions about his employment status. Julie Gunlock at [American Greatness](https://www.amgreatness.com/2018/10/06/cosko-is-not-an-unpaid-intern/) suggests Cosko is being paid as a fellow from an outside liberal group.**

While she claims Cosko was an “unpaid intern” in her office, the Washington Post reports that Cosko was actually a “fellow.” This was confirmed by Cosko’s lawyer, who said his client was a “fellow” in Jackson-Lee’s office and that he was being paid by an “outside institution.”

What “outside institution” paid for Cosko’s fellowship? Did that entity know about his illegal activities? What other fellowships does this “outside organization” pay for? What other House or Senate offices are hosting fellows paid by this organization?

“Intern” and “fellow” are not interchangeable because they aren’t even close to being the same thing. While internships are reserved for inexperienced college students, fellowships are usually serious policy positions and are typically filled by professionals working within other federal agencies or the private sector who are brought to a congressional office for a short stint to help a member of Congress better understand the agency or business for which that member has oversight responsibilities…

…According to the Legistorm website and a report by the Washington Post, Cosko was employed as a paid congressional aide to Hassan from January 2017 until May of this year and had the title “legislative correspondent and systems administrator.” Yet according to the same database, his pay ended on March 31, not in May.

Cosko also worked for former Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and some media reports also state that before his paid position with Boxer, he had an unpaid internship with Senator Feinstein (a timeframe that would put him in his early 20s and a much more normal age for an internship).

The [latest media reports](https://wtop.com/congress/2018/10/i-own-everything-senators-childrens-health-social-security-info-threatened-in-email/) on Cosko are chilling. They detail how after sneaking into Senator Hassan’s office at 10 p.m. (an office he was not authorized to enter since he had been fired months earlier), he logged onto a computer using the login information of a still (for now) employed Hassan staffer. When he was discovered and shooed out of the office by another Hassan staffer who ostensibly was working late that night, he sent that staffer a threatening note: “If you tell anyone I will leak it all. Emails signal conversations gmails. Senators children’s health information and socials,” meaning Social Security numbers.

So, according to the information available on Cosko, including his own lawyer’s statements about his client’s employment history, along with the latest story revealing Cosko’s depraved threat, it’s seems clear Cosko isn’t some unlucky and overzealous intern who got caught being a naughty boy. Rather, it seems Cosko might be a Democratic operative, paid by an outside organization, planted in an unpopular congresswoman’s office possibly so he could engage in exactly the type of behavior that just got him arrested.

9mepjg,2,2018-10-08,I finally realized that I'll probably die alone,Kryoxic,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9mepjg/i_finally_realized_that_ill_probably_die_alone/,"So yes, I'm only 19, but hear me out. Realistically, the chances of me finding someone who'll actually stick with me are virtually none at this point. I think it's because of the path that I'm on?

I want to really succeed in AI. But that takes time and effort that I really can't divert anywhere else. That means going to that internship hours away in San Francisco or Austin, or going to grad school at Stanford or MIT or wherever life decides to take me. I've worked so hard to get to where I am now that I just don't feel like I want to settle down until I'm 40 and established in the field. And who in their right mind would decide to be with someone like me? Someone who'll never stay in one place for too long. Someone who's never gonna be willing to settle until he's satisfied at some point far into the future.

I've had a lot of time to mull over this. But realistically, I just don't see any way I could ever cross paths with someone who'll be able to stick with a person like that. This is also coupled with the fact that I've only ever felt something for 2 people and they both rejected me, which might have contributed to this conclusion.

I just don't know anymore. What should I even do at this point besides just trucking along like I've been doing?"
9meuuh,1,2018-10-08,21 [A4A] Literate M x M Fandom Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9meuuh/21_a4a_literate_m_x_m_fandom_romance/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. I have the entire long weekend off and want to keep myself entertained! Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M) (Sonic)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama (all characters will be aged up to +18)

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+, and I only rp with people who are also 18+. &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

N1njastar28

Hope to rp soon!

9mf9u1,1,2018-10-08,Degree Advice... Again,Emperor-Valtorei,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9mf9u1/degree_advice_again/,"Hey, I know I ask a lot of very similar questions, and I apologize ahead of time. I’m just worried and I’m hoping to get things done in the best way possible...

Some background first... I initially planned on going to Illinois State University because it was a school I could commute to, the finance and accounting degrees have a lot of overlapping so a double major was in finance and accounting was feasible. I do work full time, so I’d have to roll the dice and hope I can do a majority of the classes online and maintain my GPA in the the leaving coursework. ISU also has an integrated masters program where I would most likely earn in business administration.

Lately, I’ve discovered that I am short 4-5 classes of a computer science minor or 3-5 classes short of an information science minor. I’ve also learned that Western Illinois University is around $3000 cheaper, I would qualify for a $1000 a year scholarship for being an in-state transfer student. They also have an accounting program for my bachelors which is 100% online. This is great since I work full time and I’m an hour and a half away from the campus, but it also sucks because I’d be unable to go into finance. They do have an integrated program as well.

No matter where I go, I’m afraid to go for an internship as I am currently working full time at Best Buy and I put in a lot of effort to get the position and I’ve made it clear I’m ambitious. I’ve also made a reputation in the market as I’m skilled at my job and have numbers to prove it. I’m afraid of disappointing my GM who’s worked hard to aid in my growth within the company, and I’m afraid an internship will lead to unemployment afterwards.

Note: So long as I hold a full time position with Best Buy at the start and the end of a semester, the company reimbursed me for up to $3500 a year for my tuition.

So here’s the questions I have...

1 - Would it be better to do a double major in finance and accounting, or do a finance or accounting major with a CS or IS minor?

2 - Would a finance degree allow me to go into accounting if post-graduation I enjoy that work more?

3 - In terms of my current situation with work and school, which school would be the better choice? The tuition cost doesn’t matter.

4 - Would the integrated masters in Business Administration be worthwhile without relevant experience?

5 - Other than Google and Reddit, are there resources I can reach out to in regards to career and education planning so that I can begin setting goals and expectations for myself?

6 - Is there a way I can gain experience in accounting before I do an internship or get another job?

7 - Am I worrying and stressing too much?

Thank you in advance and I apologize for asking so many questions so often."

I am moving to Cologne in a few months. Super excited!!

I figured where I will live and other stuff. While not urgent, I want to find a job. Ill have Master's degree in Computer science. Did couple of small projects, but do not have much experience. I speak German but it is not perfect, more like conversational. (I do not have a cerfiticate). So far, I have profile on Xing but I don't have many connections there like on LinkedIn. I check monster.de but don't see many junior positions. I put a lot of effort in my CV but it is in English. Should I translate it to German?

Will I have trouble finding job at junior level (or intern)? Can you recommend some companies I should send my CV/CL to? Or should I go to every company in Cologne and leave a copy? 

Danke in advance 

Edit - great answers, now I wish I could move tomorrow"
9mfrmi,0,2018-10-08,The Next Step,WidebodyAllTheCars,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9mfrmi/the_next_step/,"About a year ago, I met a girl when I was on an internship in another state. I asked her out and we went on a few dates before I moved back home in December of last year. We both agreed to stay as friends when I left since neither of us wanted a long distance relationship. 

About mid-January of this year, I started having my doubts about our friendship. I still liked her and we talked a decent amount, but felt it was going nowhere since I did not know if I was going to even see her again. It was starting to get to me and I needed to focus on school, so I ghosted her. On Valentine’s day, she reached out to me to see how I was doing since it had been over a month since we last spoke. I was hesitant to reply, but I eventually did and we started talking again.

For the last 8 months or so, we’ve steadily grown our friendship despite my previous doubts. I still thought about moving on, but every time I met someone else, I would think of her and just not be interested in them. I feel like I was unfairly comparing her to them since I thought so much about her.

Fast forward to today, I still have feelings for her and we still talk quite frequently about things effecting our lives (work, school, life in general). She has shown nothing but support for me in everything I do. I am expecting to graduate from college this December. I’ve considered moving back to her state for work, but haven’t had the opportunity to do so. I most likely won’t be moving back due to job opportunities, meaning our relationship probably won’t work out. I am worried about moving away from her and struggling to find someone else and move on. 

My question is, what is the next thing I should do? Should I continue to talk to her until I reach a point that I can be with her, or force myself to move on in another way?

9mfwai,212,2018-10-08,Bar Villa wants Pity amongst other people's problems.,XcentrkTnKs,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9mfwai/bar_villa_wants_pity_amongst_other_peoples/,"Because of course she does.

Strap in for a bit of a long one. I'll try to he as concise as possible but its been a fucking week. 

So OB (older brother) is staying with us until at least the 15th. He has gotten his internship out of the country, paid for it, and submitted all but one final requirement for it. We hit some bumps along the way with his sobriety while he has been here, but things are okay. 

At first Bar Villa was at arms length. She didn't want to be involved or even throw money at the situation this time which is fine by me because its one less foot hold she can think she has. This distance didn't stop her from demanding visits down to her bumble fuck nowhere farm, trying to take credit for shit that she had nothing to do with, actually doing something right amongst the bull shit, and then trying to make everything worse because she thinks her life is harder than anyone else. 

Prepare for rantsplanation:

The one thing she did right was get the appointment with my psychiatrist for OB moved up which otherwise would have been impossible because they are backlogged with new patients. She drove up to my house afterwards to talk to OB without having to worry about JNGM getting fed up and wanting to leave. 

Now at the time of this impromptu visit, OB had already submitted his application for the internship earlier that morning. This is important. I repeat. *OB submitted said application hours prior to any hint that BV would be paying us a visit*. 

I stayed in earshot so I could know for sure that BV was not about to make all our lives harder. At one point she threatened to light a fire under OB's ass if he didn't get on his internship asap. He told her and I confirmed that it was a work in rapid progress. Eventually she goes home. 

Right after she gets home I get a video call from her, as soon as I find both my eyeballs on the floor after they rolled completely out of their sockets, I answer. Apparently JNGM has gone off the rails in true JN fashion at BV because she was *supposed to just go to the bank and come straight home*. 

BV had not planned on stopping by the doctors office when she ventured out, but since the bank was right there she decided to stop and see if she could get his appointment sooner. She worked a miracle with the office manager and boom OB had a much needed appointment the following day. You would think everyone would be thrilled and ecstatic. 

Apparently not JNGM as she was accusing BV of lying to her about where she was going (and I just shook my head at all of this bc we are talking about two adults well past 50s and JNGM doesn't have any sway in decisions bc she is in the care of BV, not the other way around). JNGM went as far are storming up to BVs private room, beating on her door and shoving BV several times in attempts to get her to fight with her. 

Well fuck me. 

OB was in earshot as BV told me all of this and with a confused expression shook his head. He had been playing with DS in the yard close by and so mouthed to me that he would call JNGM. 

Now if you all thought OB was the GC to BV, JNGM takes the cake. JNGM was the closest OB had to someone like my Granny and so they are extremely close. He can do no wrong in her eyes and until recently she could do no wrong in his, and she would listen to him. 

So OB calls JNGM, they all settle down and all is well right? 

Silly llamas, this is JNMIL. We are just getting started. 

OB gets an email later that evening and its from the research foundation hosting the internship. It had been less than 12hrs since he submitted his application and they had already gotten back to him to say he got a spot and they were extremely excited to have him on board as he is one of the most qualified candidates they have seen. 

We celebrate and start calling *everyone*. I even called my dad who is not OBs dad, and DH at work. High fives all around. Everyone is proud of OB and this accomplishment towards living his dream after everything he has been through this year, his life is about to drastically change for the better. Love and congrats and proud hugs abound.

Then we call BV. First BV wanted to take credit for it. 

Remember how I mentioned his application was submitted *before* she showed up? She knew that as we told her when she asked. But this is BV so cue her incessant need to rearrage and ""misremember"" facts to make herself the hero. She now believes she is the reason OB got the internship, wouldn't shut up about *her accomplishment*...total buzz kill. 

But wait, it gets **worse**.

After claiming OBs accomplishment as her own she immediately starts in on the bullshit with JNGM. I realize quickly that she is about to completely ruin this for OB, cut her off and hang up. OB is clearly deflated but DH gets home from work early and helps me pick up the general spirit back to to at least some what jovial. 

The next day I call BV to check on the state of things bc we are supposed to visit her for her birthday but I don't want us or OB right smack dab in the middle of their shit. 

Shit is still going pearshaped and escalating with JNGM. Now her reasons for being mad have shifted from BV ""lying to her"" to now she is mad that BV didnt help her youngest brother who died like a decade ago from drug and alcohol abuse. Now I get that OB has had a drinking problem but to say he and the deceased uncle are alike in any sense is by far a stretch from here to the moon. Not to mention BV helping OB (her child) is in now way related to her helping or not helping her younger brother. 

OB is again within earshot and now shit is kicking in with him. He passed me a note that said he pretty much felt like his existence was causing nothing but problems. 

Llamas ... I. Went. Off. I went off on BV for a good hour, yelling, cussing, spitting. You would have thought she had hurt DS or DH at the level of blood I was out for. I wanted to do the same to JNGM but no one could get her to emerge from her room to answer the phone bc shes a cranky bat coward who knew better than to try me with the level of which I could be heard around the world at that point. 

DH got off work to find me still launching my assault on everyone about how stupid this was and how they were making OB feel worse at a time he should br focusing on the future and how they all needed to grow the fuck up, and if they both love him *soooo much* then they needed to set this kind of shit aside and focus on the person they both supposedly love more than anything instead of creating more stumbling blocks for him. He can't just enjoy his accomplishment because they are both so hell bent on ruining it and I had more than enough of it.

DH and OB just sat and stared at me through my nuclear attack. BV was crying by the time I was done and giving OB apologies. I hung up the phone and apologized to them both. 

DH just shrugged as he assumed if i was launching at BV i had valid reason. OB, however had tears in his eyes and at first I thought I did the wrong thing so I apoligized to him again. He said I wasn't wrong, but that he was just touched I was so much in his corner to defend and support him and it was nice to know at least someone was given what BV and JNGM were doing.

Eventually BV promises me and DH that everyone will behave. OB, i had noticed, was having a hard time with it all still but he hadnt really lost control with anything. But we knew if we didn't go visit for her birthday, BV would hang it over our heads. We had a plan to keep the visit short and be on our way quickly. 

Well, when OB went in with DH to buy BV flowers he also bought some beer. Now I haven't forced OB to be dry the last two visits bc he has medication that helps and he really has more control than anyone I have seen especially given the problems he has had with it. Plus he is over 40 and an adult and if you remove the thrill of it being ""wrong"" and he has no real desire to do it. 

Apparently the shit between BV and JNGM was still really getting to him. He cracked open a beer **while I was driving** on the back roads of bumble fuck nowhere, where I personally know the sheriff and his deputies dont play, this is an open container and he is sitting right next to my son. 

I tried to let it go until we left. I made a comment as we got out of the car not to do it again, and he said okay. But the demeanor was that of a teenager who cant play Xbox in the middle of church. In hindsight I know this was maladaptive coping but I was hurt and livid at the whole thing and felt severely taken advantage of. 

So in front of BV and SDad I confronted him. At first his reaction was ""well lets leave so I can buy a ticket home"". I told him no, we arent leaving yet bc you need to talk to me about why you did this and why you arent sorry. 

BV decides this is a perfect time to tell everyone JNGM is refusing to eat and hasnt done so in two days and JNGMs doctor wants her to go to the ER but they cant convince her to go and BVs life has just been sooooooo haaaarrrrrddddd dealing with this on top of what has been going on with OB...which she hasnt done shit but bitch and moan about it all. 

OB gets up and goes to the main house to talk to JNGM. BV continues her tirade about how hard her life is and how we all just don't understand and blah blah blah. 

The only break in BVs pissing contest that only she was participating in, is Sdad actually trying to comfort me and tell me that OBs slip wasn't my fault and I cant make him get better if he doesnt want to and he knows I'm doing my best and going above my responsibility since I got involved. 

Everything eventually got to be too much.

I could feel the tears of all these weeks bubbling up to the surface, all the emotions I hadnt been able to shed and deal with threatened to tumble out and I didn't want BV to have the satisfaction of seeing me break, much less DS see me cry bc he would worry. So I took a walk through the property, found a tree far away from everyone else and let it all out until I could rightfully control it. 

When I walked back DH asked if i was okay and i told him i was, I just couldnt breathe freely so I took a Vistaril and tried to still myself. BV kept on going and Sdad just tried his best to comfort me between her rambles.

Eventually I went back to the car and got the rest of the six pack. I intended to pour it all out right there, but Sdad suggested I stick it in the fridge and see if OB even noticed it was gone instead. (That way if he did and it was a confrontation sdad could intervene)

OB came back and said that JNGM agreed to eat for him but she didnt want him to tell BV or Sdad about it. No one had eaten anything all day so we all went to eat at a chinese place BV likes, then we headed home. 

OB and I had a talk when we got back and he told me he really was sorry and it had been a terrible idea to do what he did instead of just talking to me. He hadnt been feeling great the last few days and he is used to not having anyone to talk about it to so he defaulted, admitting he didnt even really know why bc he knows he can talk to me about it all and I'll help him. We talked about the emotions that caused him to retreat inwards and we worked through a new game plan for combatting them.

We set some new rules in place and he has abided since then without hesitation, dispute, or issue.

I really needed some self care after all of that, so yesterday we piled into the car and went downtown to a nice spehora where DH let me set my own budget, subsequently spend past it, and he didnt bat an eye at it. (Okay not fully the truth he had a minor heart attack at the final total but said it was just sticker shock).

I told everyone (including BV) that I would be taking a bath to enjoy my haul, that I would be locking myself in the bathroom with a bottle of wine and a pack of smokes and I would not be emerging until I felt like I'd hit the reset button. 

Of course that didn't sit well with BV who had spent all day in her private room, napping and relaxing at will down on her farm. So she spam called me to the point that my Pandora station spazzed and shut off.  I finally said okay fine, you want to talk so bad, lets talk. 

So naked in the bath tub, razor in my hand, and deep conditioning cap on my head I answered BVs video call. 

She stopped, stunned for a moment as I stared at her and through gritted teeth said ""This. Is. Why. I. Wasn't. Answering.""

She nonpologized and then went into a tirade about how while I was in the bath tub OB was talking to JNGM on the phone and she just *KNEW* it was going to be bad for OB. 

I told her both DH and DS were with OB outside and that if they could all understand my need for that bath she could too. DH could handle things for a couple of hours and that if some shit went really south he would come and get me. Otherwise at that moment I was off the clock and everyone could rightly **fuck the hell off**. Then I hung up, and texted DH. 

He popped his head in to tell me everything was fine and fuck BV, DS started to cry bc mommy was in the bathtub without him (I get in with him on the rare occasion he does a bath and not a shower so he will stay in long enough for the eczema soak to do him some good). 

DH saw me deflating, ordered me to enjoy my bath and shut the door which I locked again behind him. 

I drained and refilled the hot water two more times and chugged Riesling straight out of the 1.5l bottle and relished each new overpriced and lushious product from my Sephora haul. Then I mixed a moon juice sleep dust pack in one more glass of wine and went to bed at 9pm. 

Dude. Fuck. Bar. Villa. 

At least I can relish the surprise on her face at seeing me naked and enjoying the expensive skin care shit she hates DH lets me buy and spoils me with. 


Baby tax!

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

9mhdb8,29,2018-10-08,Adventures in Awful RP (LONG) A Saga of Stupid,TheyKilledFlipyap,BadRPerStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/9mhdb8/adventures_in_awful_rp_long_a_saga_of_stupid/,"Sorry for the slightly vague title, but... this story has so many ""bad"" things in it, I genuinely can't pick just one, or even the one that stands out the most. 

Part of me was tempted to call it a ""That Guy"" story, because in a way, it is. But I've lurked on this sub and others, I've read my share of stories, and trust me when I say this isn't your average everyday *that guy.* This is... **Advanced** That Guy. 

This is gonna be a long read, and I honestly don't expect many people to stick around for the whole thing. But I want to get this off my chest and just say it out loud, so to speak. So get a drink, a snack, maybe cue up a playlist of suitably dramatic music or somethin', this is gonna be a long read.

--

**I: The Setup;**

This all began close to a *decade* ago now. But for brevity's sake, I'll be jumping right to the spectacularly terrible *ending.* Confused yet? It's okay, I am too. 

Way back when, I entered my first fandom. You know the type. Where you just get so invested in a certain TV Show, movie, video game, whatever, that you *throw* yourself into it, accumulating all the expensive tie-in media and merchendise you can lay your hands on, talking about it as often as you can with anyone who'll listen, when you really embrace your inner dork. That was dumb teenager me. 


--

So on a website I frequented at the time (now defunct, good riddance) there was- inevitably, a corner of it devoted to this fanbase. It wasn't a dedicated RP site, no, just one of the many many proto-social-media like sites that fell by the wayside when Facebook achieved world domination. I joined in and chatted to folks, making a few friends and taking every opportunity I could to share my accumulated wealth of useless trivia and general overenthusiasm.

The orginal moderator of this little subforum quit less than a week or two after the fandom ""blew up"" as big as it had, leaving moderation of this forum in the hands of our protagonist. Or... should that be antagonist. The subject of the story anyway. Who was not the right choice for this role, as you'll soon find out. 

--

For the sake of protecting the *guilty* we'll call him Del. He's had many names, titles and psudonyms over the years, some of which are just plain gibberish. So Del will do. 


Del took over moderation of the sub-forum, an obscure corner of a niche but passionate fandom. It was super mundane work, and he barely *did* any moderation of any kind. Mostly just latching onto a popular thing that- although he was clearly passionate about to some degree, he always had to make it about *him,* using the news and announcements page as more of a personal blog than anything else. Nobody really cared enough to object, there was something endearing about his genuine enthusiasm at the time so we let things slide. 

Around the start of January, that's when things began in earnest. The Roleplaying.

--


**II: You Never Forget Your First;**

Del had set up a poll in the forum asking if people would be interested in a ""RP"" based in the universe of the fandom we were all geeking out about. I didn't even know what that *meant,* as this was really my first time dipping my toes into the internet beyond the typical ""Youtube &amp; flash games"" crap. Once it was explained, I got hyped for the idea, digging into all my fandom books and wiki's to make the most *canonically accurate* fan-character I could for this. 

It was terrible, I'll admit. My writing, my style (or lack thereof), I didn't bring much to the table creatively, beyond making an ass of myself. But we were all new to this and so all the clumsy tripping over ourselves was half the fun. For a time, this *worked.* We had fun, and I honestly do have some fond memories of the dumb adventures we went on. There was fanart, world-building, characters were shipped, etc, your typical forum RP community. 

--

What came next was Del's... ambition. He was enthralled with this particular fandom, but it didn't last. Every time something new came along, his interests would shift and his attention would gravitate *solely* towards that. And that applied to his RP preferences as well. It was a very noticeable cycle. 

New media (movie, tv show, game, etc.) comes out. Del gets hooked on it, creates a new RP forum for it, the hype train dies, starts over with something else. But each time he did this, he'd drag a few people over from the existing RP forums he'd allowed to die off as a result of his neglect, or some drama caused by his inability or unwillingness to manage people. 

One forum endured though. Far, far longer than it should've... 

--

**III: Fireflop;**

A while after the initial RP campaign we'd all started together had slowly began to wither, the ""second-in-charge"" moderator, who we'll call Jim, decided to create his own RP. We were all excited about this, as he was definitely one of the stronger writers of the bunch of us, but always seemed to lean towards being a player rather than a DM. 

He was going through a Firefly phase, really loving the idea of a crew of mismatched criminals taking odd jobs to make ends' meets in an unforgiving space-western like galaxy. And that was the concept he pitched. He would run the story, each of us would write a character to act as a crewman aboard whatever ship we ended up running together to fill a specific role. 

Jim'd take the captaincy (y'know, DM proxy to keep the other players in line), someone else would be the engineer, someone would be the navigator, someone would be the muscle, etc, you get the jist. 

--

And the real kicker was this; it was *fair game* as far as species went. We all had varying, disparate interests as far as fandoms went, with rare moments of overlap. So Jim anticpated this, and said we could pick any race we wanted from whatever sci-fi setting took our fancy. I was interested before, now I was *hyped.* I had my fingers in a lot of space universes, and I could pick whatever ones I wanted to write from now? Fuck yeah.


Here's the problem though. Jim was inexperienced at managing a forum, let alone DM'ing a campaign. So *Del* was invited to help with the responsibilities. So inevitably... Del... happened.

--


Remember how Del tends to get a little *too* carried away with whatever thing-of-the-week holds his interest? Well unfortunately for Jim, he set this little RP of his up around a month or so after the release of *Mass Effect 2,* a Sci-fi RPG that really needs no introduction. It's iconic, and for very good reasons. 

Problem is... Del wasn't paying attention to what Jim had written. Jim wanted space western, Del wanted Space Opera. These two things are not exactly what you'd call *compatible.* Not in our ameteurish hands anyway. 

--

So when Jim posted his character sheet and bio for a captain of some rustic ol' barely-hanging-together freighter, Del's character sheet was more *""Supreme Grand Admiral WhoTheFuckCares of the majestic eternal imperium of hot alien babes.""* Who instead of joining the crew of the ship as advertised... had brought their own ship, which was so stupidly large that Jim's poor rinky-dink tug could park inside of it a hundred times over. 

--

Right off the bat, we had the equivelant of Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon bumping elbows with *The Arbiter from Halo* and his glorious fleet of planet-melting capital ships... It was clear to all of us this wasn't gonna work. 

--

If I had to divy up blame for this, I'd say it's a 25/75 split between Jim and Del. See in our old forum, we had dedicated threads for character creation. Here, for the space RP? We had *two* threads. One for character bio's, and one for starships. Jim had posted the reference images, armaments, tech-specs and internal map of his beaten up old freighter, then forgot to lock the thread after he'd done that. So Del, being... Del... thought ""Oh, that's his ship for his character. I'll design a ship for my character too!"" 

--

Again, *Mass Effect 2* was the talk of the town back then, and Del had misread the situation as *everyone* getting their own Commander Shepard like protagonist and ship, and starting some stupid space alliance to fight the big bad robot armada. And Jim was far too kindhearted to tell him ""No, you misread what we're going for here"" and refuse this. Especially after a sob-story about how Del ""stayed up all night working on this"", blah blah blah... ugh... 


So with the power balance and story setup thoroughly fucked, I asked Jim what to do. He said to scrap the character sheet I was working on (I was writing an engineer) and to write my own Captain and Starship, because *I guess we're doing Space Opera now.* So I did. 

--

**IV: To Boldly Go Fuck Yourself;**


It was a bumpy start, to say the least. I had gone from excited to kind of on the fence about this whole thing, wanting to go back to our old forum and continue with those characters. I was invested in that story because it was low stakes, it was personal. About a dozen main characters in a little community solving problems and making progress towards a clear endgoal. Now I'd been dragged into a massive Star Wars Prequels ish space-world of warships, politics and so many other things. I felt out of place, to say the least. 

--

Jim, to his credit, did a good job of salvaging this shitfest for a time. But it was quickly becoming apparent that he was creatively burnt out. His low-scale space western idea had been hijacked and stomped upon, and his posts became less frequent by the week. Leaving the DM and story arc management in the hands of, well... who else, Del. But in spite of the behind the scenes drama, things went well. At Del's prodding, I picked up the Mass Effect games and powered through them, as the *vast* majority of his characters were drawn from the species of that setting. If I can say one singular *nice* thing about Del, it's ""at least he introduced me to Mass Effect"", but that's where my compliments for this man begin and end. 

--

In spite of Jim's absence, the rest of us were starting to get onboard with the idea of this big Star Trek Federation like alliance, where all of us acted as the ""poster boys"" for our given races, each from some different corner of sci-fi obscurity. And whenever a big-bad threat emerged to plague our emergent alliance, it was something big and scary we all recognised from something, so the power fantasy of duking it out in ground and space combat with Xenomorphs, Warhammer 40k Orks, Armies of Droids and the like, it had a certain appeal. 

--

What didn't have any lasting appeal was Del's libido. Everything up to this could be forgiven as naive enthusiasm or just misreading a situation, but no... the more things went on, the more *sex* oriented things became, often with weeks passing without combat or story progression because Del decided he'd gotten bored of actually telling a story, and wanted to wallow in shallow dribbling romance sub-plots that always ended in ""and then they fuck"". 

--

Unlike Mass Effect, which at least cut-to-black before Captain Kirk could boldly go where no man has gone before, he *insisted* the smut scenes be played out... I protested this, pointing out the website's ""no explicit content"" rule, (cussing was fine, duh, I mean... no hanky-panky.) to which Del replied ""We'll do it in private messages."" 

--

At first I went along with it, as did a few others. Again most of us were around the 17-19 age zone, so yeahhh, there was a little self-indulgent xenophilic fantasy going on from time to time. But Del being Del, didn't know when to back down, and kept making it more and more about smut. It wasn't always this way. There was one particularly edgy player (we'll call him Sam) who was the first to push for the inclusion of lewd content- and did so very *abruptly* in the middle of a story arc. I sometimes wonder if Del would've ended up as the drooling perverted deviant he is today if he hadn't been given that nudge by Sam. But I digress. 

--

(Oh and side-tangeant, you wanna know how dedicated to being an edgelord Sam was? In a setting predominantly filled with non-human characters, he insisted upon playing a *Cerberus Operative* character. Y'know, the guys are xenophobic to a fault and want to set up a pro-human anti-alien regime across the galaxy? Bafflingly, he made his character half-furry... mostly human, but with dumb animé fox-ears... ugh. I was glad when he eventually got bored and left.)


--

This ended up alienating a sizeable chunk of the players. Nobody left immediately, but posts became less frequent and people started giving Del a wide berth so as to avoid being lured into one of his ""story arcs"". The pattern was very noticeable. He'd begin with some huge crisis, a massive action scene where one of the players gets the spotlight and does something smart, heroic or reckless to save the day. Del would then ""reward"" the player by throwing some alien bimbo at them as the fuckable trophy, refusing to relent until someone got laid.... 

--

Again, I blame Mass Effect's childish romance subplot system for this behaviour. Love the games to death, but treating ""getting to bang the alien"" as a trophy for talking to them for -x amount of conversations- was not a good idea. It just turns impressionable geeks into a whole new generation of *Nice-Guys™* who think ""basic human courtesy entitles me to booty."" But I digress;

**V: Stepping Out of The Shadows;**


The upswing of all this was that at this point, I'd improved my writing, both in style and content, to the point where it was becoming very obvious that I had, for lack of a better term; *outgrown* Del. He still had the keys to the kingdom as far as running the story and the vast majority of NPC's, but more and more players were seeking *my* characters out for missions, or chatting to them during downtime between conflicts. 

--

I'm honestly not trying to humble-brag here, I'm not the best RP'er- not then, and not now. But context matters, and the attention I was getting did not go anywhere positive. Turns out Del doesn't like people hogging his spotlight, so at this point his behaviour turned from ""well intended stupid"" to ""malicious and lecherous"". 

--

From this point on, he'd start forcing his own characters into subplots and story arcs that were going on between other players, stories he didn't belong in and had no stake in, but felt the need to assert his presence in at the risk of being ""neglected."" And any new plots going on outside of these? He'd structure the story arcs in such a way that my characters *only* ever interacted with *his* characters.  They weren't my characters as far as he was concerned. No matter how much time I invested into writing them, drawing them, spending money to commission artists to draw reference material, no. 

--

They were *his.* His ""property."" He treated them like things to be hoarded and covetted. He got very territorial about others interacting with my veteran characters, including harassing people outside of the forum through messaging to tell them to ""back off"" of the characters that he'd been trying to charm into any kind of romantic or sexual (more often than not sexual...) relationship. I didn't find out about this until too late to do anything about it, the damage had been done and the bridges were burnt. 

Nobody was allowed to have any modicum of interactions with his space-waifu's, only him. 

What, no, of course you don't get a say, *person who created the character,* shut up and get back in the bedroom for the sake of my childish fantasies.

--

So to combat this, I made new characters from scratch so that I could get some meaningful interactions with other players- creating stories and scenarios in the same ""universe"", but not anywhere near the regions the Federation-like alliance so that he couldn't meddle in these stories. As a result, he'd either treat these characters who weren't in his little alliance clique as *Pariahs* at best, or outlaws at worst, and twist the story to make them feel unwanted or unwelcome in the setting, or just try and ""encourage"" people to only engage with characters and plots he had 100% control over. The lengths he went to were genuinely laughable. At one point he expressly forbid one of my characters from being in the same *solar system* as another player's, out of a fear that they'd abscond with them and flee at the first chance.


*(I mean he wasn't wrong, I totally would've. But that's not the point.)*

--

**VI: A Change of Scenery;**


As the years went on, the well of goodwill Del had built up over the years had diminished to a puddle, for all the reasons above and many more that would warrant their own posts. Those of us still left were invested in the setting, our characters... just not in anything Del had to offer, creatively. Ironically, hating Del became the community's gimmick. We all had our own grievances with the guy, and part of why we kept around for as long as we did was just to see how far he'd run things into the ground, what new levels of derp he'd contrive for his 'stories' and the setting, such as it was. 

--

So in an attempt to *reinvigourate* his obviously bored and burnt-out playerbase, Del shifted gears from Sci-fi, creating a Fantasy RP. Remember how I said his hype for Mass Effect 2 ended up making it all he could focus on way back at the start of the Sci-fi RPG? Well about 6 or 8 months prior, *Dragon Age: Inquisition* had come out, and inevitably, history repeated itself. The space RPG had slowly begun to die off, after nearly 5 years of characters and stories, and Fantasy was the hot topic for Del, so we were off to dungeons, castles and forests instead. This wasn't the first time he'd tried to create a fantasy setting- surprise surprise, it didn't work, but that's a story for another time. 

--

So he asks the few people left who still put up with him to create character sheets. There were no stats or dice. Just name, appearance, backstory, quirks, etc. His ones were always novel length cliché-ridden barely legible walls of text about twice the length of this post... 

--

I hashed together a basic half-elf Rogue. Redhead, fond of knives. We'll call her Red. She was a returning / re-adapted character from the aforementioned fantasy game that fell apart. Del's idiotic behaviour and poor writing actually got her killed, and that was what caused the old fantasy game to crash. I brought her back for this one out of *stubborn pride* on my part. 

--

Who's Red? Nobody special in the grand scheme of things. Just the spark that lit the flame that ended up burning this whole mess to the ground. Bit of a smarmy Bitch with a penchant for murderous death-traps and monster hunting. Edgy black coat and feathers getup. Typical Bloodborne kinda thing. Del wasn't the only one motivated by his passions after all, I'm only human, and I was really geeking out on Bloodborne lore and imagery at the time. 

--

I used [placeholder art](https://i.imgur.com/R6ymedD.jpg) for the character bio page as I was in the middle of a really rough internship and had neither the time or energy to draw a character piece myself, or the funds to hire someone else to do that. 

--


But Del, being Del... He took matters into his own hands. He did have the cash to hire an artist. And did so. Without telling me. Or even asking me if I wanted artwork. He just saw the rough draft page, saw the placeholder art and was off to the races. *Keep this in mind. I'll be coming back to this.*

--

**VII: Lemme Smash. Plz.**

So the Fantasy game begins. A party of adventurers gathered to the plaza of some elven castle for a job briefing, y'know, the usual affair. And near instantaneously, like fucking immediately. Del has one of his newly minted characters try and put the moves on Red. Not that it needs to be said, but Red is a monster Hunter whose backstory made it very clear she hates plague and lycanthropy *(werewolves)* more than anything. 

And this dumb motherfucker tries to get in her pants with a *Skaven.* (for those who don't know warhammer; that means a humanoid plague rat....) He made a point of saying this particular Rat ""isn't like the other ones"", like... having a sense of hygene? But I'm not convinced. And frankly I was in a bad mood. As I said, internship, and I was here for some actual escapism, not to be the object of a waste of time fuckfest. 
 
--

So Red promptly in-character tells the Ratman to fuck off. Literally, in fact. Like I said, she's a bit abrasive. And truth be told, I was using her as a proxy to vent my frustrations with his nonsense. Ratman is insistent, and won't back down. Red draws her blades to make it more obvious *she's not interested.* 


For a moment, I think **maybe**, just maybe this is on purpose. Like he's baiting me into starting a fight to get the plot going. But no. He'd written a novel's worth of backstory for this irritating and tactless Rat. And was genuine in his attempts to ""flirt"" with Red. This was his ""best foot forward"", and rather than presenting any kind of narrative, wanted to get in her pants. 


I insist again, this time *out of character* in case the threat of violence is somehow interpreted as ""just playing hard to get"", that Red is having none of this and Ratman should take the fucking hint while he has all his limbs attached. Because Red has blades, and no qualms about using them. 

--


What follows is a whiney rant from Del in the Out-of-character forum about how Red should *'lighten up'* and *""quit being so frigid.""* Followed by an in-character reply not long after where a nearby NPC who apparently overheard the references a relationship Red had in the *failed* RP that collapsed. Something to the effect of ""You sure didn't mind sleeping with [that character]"" in some strangely backhanded attempt at *Slut-Shaming* her for **Not** immediately wanting to spread for this unwashed bipedal rodent.

--

Side-note; There was no way for the NPC to *know* that part of her backstory but fuck logic and consistency right? This was another annoying trend of Del's. He had no abillity to *not* Meta-game. If it was something he the player knew, all of his characters knew it too. Regardless of proximity, distance or other factors. 

If you got on one NPC's nerves, he'd have the next 5 or 6 of them you talked to act prickly and scornful towards you, regardless of whether you'd actually done anything to attract such ire. Because he was that petty that if he wasn't getting his way, he'd punish you for it by any means neccesary, logic be damned.

--

With my irritation palpable, both in-character and out of, I stop replying to the forum for the night. Like I said, I had an internship and college to contend with, I had better shit to do.

--

**VIII: The Beginning of the End;**

Next day at my internship, my lunch hour rolls around. I'd brought a small laptop with me for this exact reason. I'm chatting with some of the other RP Forum regulars on Skype (Ah the days before discord...) just shooting the shit really. One of my buddies- who we'll call Martin, was at his job too with the same idea. He was in the same time zone as me, so there was some overlap as to when we had a free hour or so to chat. He was- compared to most of us ""new"" to the RP forums, but I'd known him around a year or so. 

--

For the record, *this* is the person Del would constantly try and find ways to keep me away from in the Sci-fi RP. This was the guy whose character it was Del was afraid would steal away his favourite space-girlfriend if given half the chance. 

At one point Martin stopped replying to the active conversation. It was a group text chat, we drifted in and out as necessary. It was the middle of the day, and like I said, he was at work. Stuff comes up. We thought nothing of it.

--

Martin returns a while later. It's all text chat but he's clearly a little shaken up. Says he just... passed out at his desk at work. Inexplicably. For him if was like a light switch, went from at his desk to on the floor surrounded by co-workers. But they said he was out cold for a solid *minute,* no breathing, no reaction to stimulus. 

We in the Skype group chat offer sympathies amidst confusion, and speculate. My guess was heatstroke (It was summer at the time and very intensely so,) but regardless we recommend Martin go see a Doctor.

He did so the next day. And the results were shocking. Apparently he'd suffered from what's called a *Vasovagal Syncope* (I had to google it to make sure, but I'm probably mis-spelling that anyway) which in simple terms means *brain failure.* That ""minute"" he'd blacked out? Brain, heart and lungs all stopped as a result of lowered blood pressure. Apparently if he'd been unconscious any longer, it absolutely would've been fatal. It's one of those weird conditions where it can land anywhere on the dial from harmless to lethal. Human anatomy sucks like that.


Naturally we're all freaked the fuck out upon hearing this and double down on the sympathy and support.

--

What does this have to do with the RP forum and Del's shenanigans?

Well Like I said, I'd stopped replying for a day or so because *fuck that.* I have better things to do than spend my R&amp;R time rebuffing the advances of a horny rat.

And Martin, who was also part of this forum, wasn't posting either. He was still working on his character bio when this all went down, so naturally the rest of us understood he needed more time to write that up, on account if the whole ""nearly having a brain haemorrage"" thing.


Here's the issue. Del was *not* part of our little Skype group chat... (which was kind of the point, as I said before, we all had our gripes with the guy and needed a private place to vent)

So Del had no knowledge of what was going on with Martin and his misbehaving brain. 

--

**IX: Boobs, Brains &amp; Blunders**

With nobody replying to Del's fantasy RP forum thread besides one or two people who weren't all that engaged or were waiting for Martin's character to show up, Del does two things in response. 

First he posts the *""updated""* character artwork for Red in a public gallery attached to the forum. The artwork he'd had done without my knowledge or consent? Yeah we're going back to that.

[This was the artwork](https://i.imgur.com/8CTC8fa.jpg) if you're morbidly curious. If you need me to explain what's wrong with it, I don't know where to even begin. It's not *bad* art, it's well drawn, but... geez, the... *questionable proportions* absolutely ruin it.

For the record? I hold no resentment towards the artist responsible. He drew what he was told and paid to draw, no ill will there. My annoyance stems from Del's behaviour. Given the time frame, he'd obviously had this commissioned *before* the thread got going and the nonsense with Ratboy occured. 

He just saw the placeholder art and glanced at the bio, then thought ""Ahah! You need artwork? I'll take this monster-hunting mercenary and make her a *bimbo,* it'll be great! This mixed with his antics in immediately trying to get her in bed struck a nerve. I was *pissed,* and it was a sharp realization that whatever I wrote or however I portrayed my characters- male or female, they were just fucktoys in his eyes, for use in stringing along his wretched fantasies.

I have done my fair share of E-RP, it's a fun little diversion from the norm when done with the right partner and with the right overlap in interests. But trust me, Del did *not* offer that, and he only got worse over the years, his interests becoming less ""harmless deviance"" and full on *depraved.* There was no line between what was acceptable and unacceptable practice with him, believe me. I could go on, but that's a whole other story in and of itself.

--

But getting back on track, what was the other thing he did after posting this art?  

Del then messages Martin, *demanding* an explanation as to why Martin's new character bio isn't finished yet. Martin; with far *far* more patience and tolerance than this belligerent prick deserves, as he's still recovering, brings Del up to speed, explaining the whole ""I nearly died"" thing.

Del promptly replies. In the same message, *barely a sentence apart*, he feigns sympathy, then tells Martin to **""hurry up""** about getting the character bio done. 

--

**X: The End of the End;**

Martin relays this information to those of us in the Skype group, screencapping the conversation they'd had via the forum site's private messages. The reaction was, [dissappointed, but not surprised.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/388/061/201.jpg) Del had always been utterly incapable of understanding where the line between escapism and real life blurred (at one point he was reprimanded at his job for partaking in one of his endless smut-scenes at his desk while working....) this was just the next stage of that, being so overly invested in his fictions that the players' behind the screens were not worth considering. Just obstacles he had to go through to get his way. 


We unilaterally decide enough is enough. I was already livid about the shabby treatment I'd been subjected to, in-character and out of. the god awful art was salt in the wounds. 

But casually disregarding the near-death of a friend because it's *inconvenient* for your fucking hobby? That's not just callous, that's sociopathic.

--

So we create a new forum thread, wherein we all simultaneously posted our lengthy lists of grievances followed by a spiteful set of *farewell and go fuck yourself*'s. And that's that.

--

That was around 3 years ago now. And it's the best decision I ever made. I'm not getting those years of my life I wasted there back, but it cleansed my day-to-day life of a *parasite* that was hijacking my goodwill. Why did people put up with Del for as long as they did? The only person to blame there is me. I was enabling that terrible behaviour. I wanted what was best for our little community, so whenever Del said or did something dumb and annoyed others, I'd try and ""see both sides of the problem"", and talk everyone into resolving things as amicably as possible. For a time I was nicknamed ""the diplomat"" as a result... 

Cutting him out of my life was like losing some kind of cancerous tumour. My final year of college began in the Autumn after I'd cut ties with him, and my GPA actually shot up by *impressive* margins as a result of not having this crap to stress me out day by day. I wasn't an A-Student by any stretch, but I was getting High C's and B's instead of Low C's and D's. 

--

Martin and I have only grown to be firmer friends over the years since, with this incident something we look back on and laugh about. I've lost count of the number of times I've told this story- or some story about Del and his antics in some shape or form. 

As for Del? There are some constants in existence... and one of them is Del. In all the years I knew him, he never changed- not for the better anyway. And even after everyone ditched him, he's still at it, still perpetuating his... Del-ish self. He still avidly ""writes"", role-playing with whoever will pay attention to him, as well as spending ridiculous amounts of money getting artists to draw his horrendous character concepts. 

--

His wall-of-text character bios, terrible world-building and the artwork he commissions of his frankly *laughably terrible* character designs are all publicly viewable. It always brings a morbid chuckle whenever he posts some new fresh awful idea, presenting it as some kind of masterpiece of literature or creative triumph. Still employing his trademark brand of social manipulation to get people to cyber-fuck his horde of cliché-filled mary sue OC bimbos and dudebro's from every franchise across all of Fandom. It'd be fascinating if it wasn't so repulsive.

--

That's my story. I'll post more *specific* stories about my time spent on Del's forums- ranging from specific incidents, story arcs, or just anecdotes if anyone wants to hear them. But that's the overarching saga, so to speak.  "

I’m a graduating STEM major (US citizen) who also just got a french masters degree.  Because of this I can choose to work in France (with a special visa) or I can choose to stay in the US.  I really like the french culture and lifestyle and I really like the city where I did the majority of my studies in France which is probably where I would end up working if I decided to live in France.  I also have a number of friends in that city whereas my friends here in the US are spread out all over the country due to jobs.

I know I would be sacrificing obvious things like money by going to France and also being close to my family but the former isn’t too important for me at the moment as I’ve learned to budget myself with the much lower french student intern salary.  

I figure it’ll be much better to live there when I’m young than to try and do it later in life.

I’m just wondering if anyone else has ever had similar situations where they’ve had to choose between moving out and staying and what they ended up doing?  Any advice and suggestions are more than welcome as well.

Thank you!"

9mi1ia,0,2018-10-08,I [28/M] read something I shouldn't have that GF [27/F] wrote. I know I wasn't supposed to see but I'm hurt,dondoncorleonizkaya,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9mi1ia/i_28m_read_something_i_shouldnt_have_that_gf_27f/,"Throwaway because I'm embarrassed.... 

I've been dating my current GF ""Sophie"" for about 6 months. It's kind of a different trajectory for both of us. I was in hyper competitive school programs for a really long time and internships that took everything out of me. I only really started dating again at 27 and was slow to getting into anything serious. 

Sophie is from France, lives &amp; works in the U.S. and was, from the moment she left university till now, a total free spirit. She met her BFF ""Anna"" while working somewhere in Canada and they've been best friends ever since. Anna is living/working in Australia and Sophie is here on the US East Coast. They talk a lot via WhatsApp and make a point to FaceTime on weekends. Sophie is at my place this weekend/week. She's been slowly transferring things to my place thinking I won't notice - she now has half the cupboard space in the bathroom and her own space in the bedroom dressers. 

Anyway, she asked me to fix her computer and when I opened it up, it was left on a chat program. I could immediately see my name. I know I shouldn't have but I read a bit. They talked a lot about their exes and Sophie's ex in particular who is definitely opposite me in almost every way. She described the fiery passion, the very highs and lows of their relationship. She described the sex as wild and crazy and the fights the same way. Talk of me was that ""my sweet boy"" as being trustworthy, innocent and kind. She made reference to the fact that the sex we have isn't wild (but fun and passionate), that I'm ""stable"" and a lot more like the ""father and husband"" material she could realistically settle down with and that I had good career and income prospects. That hurt. I know I'm not Mr. Excitement but to read it didn't feel good. 

What hurt me more was that she wrote that this guy, ""Zane"" had messaged her. She had been seeing him around the time we started seeing each other. I guess it fizzled out because they are no longer together. She wrote about how Zane was like her ex and it was wild, that she sometimes missed the wild fun they'd have but messaged him that she was with me and that was that. He messaged her that he'd be waiting when ""she dumped me"" (she took a screenshot and sent it.). Her friend said he was creepy, which she agreed but said ""also a lot of fun."" 

It seems like her description of me is that I'm a mild mannered, even tempered guy who is husband/father material. I know I invaded her privacy (in my defense, don't leave things open and ask someone to fix your computer) and that I wasn't meant to read it, but it really hurt my feelings. I can't go to her and talk about this, but have these unresolved worries that I'm not enough for her or too dull and boring. Until this, I didn't really think about these things. I noticed her slow roll into my apartment and her taking more of a role in the decoration and cleanliness of my house, but I didn't ever think about the passion and excitement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I'm really new at this. I didn't lose my virginity until 23 and seriously date until 26. I'm not ""well versed"" in dating women and Sophie is in many ways above my pay grade. Is the lack of wild excitement and raw sexual passion a fatal flaw in our relationship? Should I let it drop? 

Until this I was considering asking her to move in as she spends most of her days here rather than anywhere else. Now I'm not sure what the hell to think

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr French girlfriend talked to her best friend and I \*accidentally\* read what they wrote. I feel pretty terrible (yes, I violated her privacy, I know). She described exes as wild and passionate and me as stable with good earning potential. I feel bad and don't know if this is a fatal relationship flaw or I'm making too much of this. "

9mi88z,20,2018-10-08,Shadow of the Tomb Raider is too mediocre to be the end of this series,syntheticgerbil,TombRaider,https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/9mi88z/shadow_of_the_tomb_raider_is_too_mediocre_to_be/,"After playing through three times now,  (one for deadly obsession, and one because of the damn 100% bug), I am absolutely disappointed with this game and all its little faults. It's buggy, lazy, poorly written, lacking in immersion, and worst of all utterly boring. This game has had a lot of money thrown at it, but besides all of the environments, I can't tell what they even worked on these last few years since everything else is phoned in and put on top of an engine and mechanics that were already there.

""This is Commander Rourke""

My guess on why the ball was dropped so hard here is just because Eidos Montreal took over. I cross referenced all of the leads found at the top of the credits and mobygames and about 75% have not worked on a Tomb Raider game before and if they did it was just to support Rise. Only one of the main design staff in that section has a Tomb Raider credit to their name. All listed names for the writing staff has only worked on either Assassin's Creed or Deus Ex Revolution. Almost all of these people are people who formerly worked at Ubisoft Montreal on some Assassin's Creed or other. And with that I think they brought all of the tedium, filler, and disengagement from the AssCreed series and put it in Tomb Raider, where it didn't belong.

"" All full up, can't carry anymore""

I could nitpick the main story but there's not much of a point, it's a bit confusing on why Dominguez is so important in Trinity or where the hell Commander Rourke came from, but mostly the game seems really uninterested in it's own storyline, going from generic plot point to generic plot point and boy was that ending an underwhelming way to finish a series. See Uncharted 4 for the real way to do it. Also the sacrifice at the end may have stunk a little of colonial racism, just because Lara was sacrificed in the place of literally anyone else. If the weak and abrupt death of Unuratu meant she couldn't be there, just sacrifice a subdued Dominguez. Don't force some silly twist where Lara is suddenly to be sacrificed, when she isn't even really, the knife just hovers over her and the magic goes away like the end to a Harry Potter. The new lead writer just brought her dull AssCreed sensibilities in lieu of anything engaging started by Rihanna Pratchett.

""Impossible, I can't carry anymore""

Okay the Jonah and Lara stuff is mostly great though, I'll give them that. I think though if you want to see how lazy the writing on this can get, just pay attention to Commander Rourke's lines. ""This is Commander Rourke"" ""This is Commander Rourke"" ""This is Commander Rourke"" I swear you could play a drinking game with how many times this dumb character introduces himself. And Suddenly he's some guy high up on Trinity? I'm sure the voice actor loved recording these redundant lines.

Also the artifacts and relics in this game are designed and written so incredibly lazy.  If they couldn't do these justice, then don't put so many. Designers shouldn't feel obligated to leave in mediocre things if the artists can't finish them. First notice every single one of these boring knick knacks is read only be Camilla Luddington, who phones this in at best. She reads so slowly and takes so many breathes, it's agonizing. It's like they did one take for each and she became so bored she was falling asleep. At least little Lara speaks at a normal pace.

In Tomb Raider 2013 and Rise, there were a variety of voice actors that painted the world well and helped with the atmosphere. Now it's just one. And beyond that, in Shadow, almost everything you pick up barely has anything to do with what is going on in the game, almost 90%. In the previous 2, the artifacts and docs almost always pertained to the main storyline. I swear 200 of the collectibles in Shadow were done by an intern who lazily copied and pasted every Maya god story on wikipedia into the game and had Camilla slowly read in.

Then beyond that, on the relics where you investigate further, pretty much none of those make sense. In the previous two games, you investigated to find more information based on zooming in on something. Now it's just about rotating the object arbitrarily (slowly and tediously) to get Lara to say a sentence that show have been a part of the main description. Sometimes she even describes things that aren't even on the 3D model. Why even do this if you are just going to do a bad job?

Then there's another problem where every mural is the same image. No one put any work into these. Camilla boringly describes a mural in which you can't see and have no context for. Maybe somewhere some artist did a sketch of all these murals they couldn't bother to make and that's where this writing comes from, but for now you have to imagine it. Just don't even bother if you are going to use the same image for every god and mural. This is pure laziness.

Also five 3D models of the same doll and same description? What are you even doing Eidos Montreal?! The game has enough filler as it is!

To go more on all of these illogical fillers, Paititi and the towns in general are a mess. Copying and pasting 3D models is fine, but every designer should know DO NOT REUSE MODELS FOR SUBQUESTS. I guess all brown people are the same so it won't matter who we switch around between Peruvians and Paititians but boy is this lazy. Also everyone who is not a main characters looks a little awkward and funky, like modeled by people fresh out of art school. Plus not one of these village or town characters has good animation. It's all awkward and bad and often breaks or stretches the 3D model in an unpleasant way.

Paititi is inconsistant because it seems like barely any men wear clothes and all women wear bags, yet the guards, Unuratu, and Dominguez is dressed up. Fine. You could make an argument that the higher class are the ones who have the clothes. But then we get to the problem where you are required to wear Unuratu's clothes for over half of the game. Why does Lara need Unuratu's clothes? They all know she's an outsider anyway and constantly say so, so you should really be able to wear whatever you want.

This is another problem with design where they completely mess it up and it's almost like they shouldn't have even bothered with outfits with perks in this game because by the time you get the really cool stuff, you can't really use it. Either most of the combat is over or it's because you spent 60% of the game wearing the Blue Heron or Achu outfit. So whoever designed the outfits was killed by another designer who felt that these ""disguises"" were so important to the story.

I played on immersion mode for the voices first way through. It's not really immersive if Lara and all the main characters still speak English but only lowly robot characters and subquest givers speak their native tongue. It's just awkward and silly to hear the two factions have a conversation. I turned it all on English the next time I played and boy was the voice acting for the villagers poor. Did they just get people around the office for those? Again they shouldn't have even bothered if they were going to do a bad job.

The writing in the hub worlds is also poor. It's all very bland whether Lara and speak with them or not. A lot of monologuing with generic stories and gossip that go on forever but are far from memorable in any way. I sat and listened to every character even when Lara was not talking to them and on subsequent playthroughs I couldn't remember if I had heard their yammering before or not.

Tomb Raider did not need new hub worlds injected with the copy and paste sensibilities of any generic open world game. There's nothing to be gained by it and it's boring to run back and forth through these villages just madly getting generic collectibles in every hut or house you see. It should have never been done further than the Remnants and Rise. That was good enough and did not detract from the story or gameplay. Instead all of these hubworlds are just a ton of filler for the gameplay that is barely there in Shadow.

To touch on the subquests, I have no idea who thought it was a bunch of fun to run around and talk to Character A B and C until you are done. They shouldn't have even made these. The engaging subquests, the horn, the medallion, and rescuing Makan are all killed with poor animation. These crappy closeups should not have been in this game. I know a lot of games lately have used these autopilot animations where the lip syncing is poorly auto generated and the animations are randomized like in Mass Effect Andromeda and Horizon Zero Dawn, but Shadow barely has that many characters and subquests that the animators could not spend time making these actually look good. They should have just stayed zoomed out of they were going to be so lazy. There's so many people on this animation team and so much money thrown on this game that I don't know where it was funneled with all this incompetence.

I think the worst part of this lazy animation is when Lara collects the horn and medallion. No character that hands the horn to her nor anything she hands to Uchu ever actually has a widget in their hand. It's all just hands moving off screen and characters looking down at their crotch. The developers seriously did this and called it a day? They couldn't manage to just have someone holding something? I don't get it. And as a broken record they shouldn't have even done these scenes if they couldn't do them right.

Also the money system in this game is absolutely bonkers. Lara is now encouraged to kill rare animals for hard cash. So the game is now about big game hunting? Rise sure, you killed some bears and cats, but they were only done so for upgrading things and then you could leave them alone once you had everything. Plus Crystal Dynamics nerfed the amount of XP you could earn from killing animals if you did it too much. Now it's just encouraged because you have to constantly keep trading to buy bullets or guns (or simply prevent Lara from saying ""All full up""). The former games, the guns were part of the collectibles, now they are just lazily crammed in shops where people in Paititi are just loaded with stuff they shouldn't have or old women making stew in Peru are selling assault rifles. Do they even understand immersion? The one shop in Rise was great because it was a guy who had only mechanical things and only took the scattered coins. Also why would people in Paititi have currency? Especially currency shared by Peruvians?!

So all of that junk above, collectibles, towns, and subquests are over half the game. The rest we are left with in terms of pure gameplay mostly filler. Challenge tombs were fine I guess but nothing was memorable. That mirror one was tedious and felt really uninspired as far as the staple with platformers and moving mirror puzzles go.

Then it's all mostly swimming and trying to pick up things where you can't carry anymore. I don't know what I can say about the swimming that hasn't already been said but it's just slow and easy so there's nothing amazing about it. You just go from point A to B at the most part and while it's cool at first, you then feel disheartened by the end when you realize swimming was half of the level design. It's like no one even wanted to design any actual levels on this team. What were these people doing all day?

And what dumbass programmer decided that Lara saying she was ""All full up, can't carry anymore"" should interrupt lines of dialogue pertaining to the main storyline?. No game should ever have those statements take priority over the main character speaking to another character or commenting on the story or environment! But nah, I guess they couldn't be bothered in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. That's how little the developers cared about the story themselves. Also the line plays even when you are doing something else because you press square and it just targets everything around Lara. In that solve the murder subquest, I could never examine the body because Lara felt it was more important to tell me she was all full up on the medicine plants sitting RIGHT NEXT TO THE BODY!

I can't even prevent Lara from saying ""All full up"" anymore because I maxed out the coins at 64,000 and you can't sell after that.

I don't really think anyone played this game in QA because no one should have thought it was okay to hear the ""All Full Up"" lines 500 times each. Just don't have Lara say anything. We can read it's full, we are not stupid. You spend millions of dollars on a game and it's almost like no one who designed it actually played the damn thing from start to finish. I mean I expect this sort of thing from Ubisoft... oh wait, most of these developers use to work at Ubisoft.

Playing this game is just molasses. There are like 100 crevices to slowly go through in this game because I guess the loading screens on this game take forever and the developers needed every second they could get to load. (You can't even skip most cutscenes because the game is still loading by the time they are finished) So it's like, you play the game a little bit, go to the next crevice and wait 10-15, play some more, repeat crevice. Oh sorry, sometimes they mix this up with thick mud for Lara to slowly and painfully walk through. Again, I don't think they played their own game.

And last the two new moves are just ill inspired. The rope swinging is fine, but dull. I think they played Uncharted 4 and decided they needed to mimic that but in an even more simplified way. Meanwhile  Tomb Raider Anniversary and Underworld had awesome rappeling rope swinging and climbing! They even used them to solve puzzles back in the day. But I doubt anyone on this team played Anniversary or Underworld and they might not even know those games exist. Oh well. The other one, climbing up rocks horizontally, what? So here's the slow climbing that seasoned players just jump through, but this time we rotated it and made it even slower and now you can jump out of it? Absolutely pointless. This added nothing.

So I just had to get that all off my chest. Thank you if you read this far and laughed at any of these faults. I am just so disappointed that this game ends this trilogy with such a whimper. I expected big things after Rise, which I found to be amazing. I guess I should blame Crystal Dynamics for handing this game off to lesser developers but that's probably all a business decision in the end. I kind of just hope for a fourth game in the new series just to finish on a better note for these characters and this type of crafting game."
9mi95l,3,2018-10-08,"Mom, I may be beginning to understand why I don't want to let go of my abusive boyfriend. What do I do now?",CaliBounded,MomForAMinute,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/9mi95l/mom_i_may_be_beginning_to_understand_why_i_dont/,"**Mom, this is going to be long, but I genuinely need advice on this.**

My boyfriend is possibly one of the most emotionally abusive people I've ever been with. I ideate with suicide whenever there's an argument, because he's fantastic at making me feel like literally everything that he does is my fault (gaslighting -- he is an enormous narcissist) and that I'm not worth as much as any person around me (constantly picks the feelings of others over me). I'm having a weird moment of clarity right now because of remembering something that happened during my breakup with the other abusive ex that I've had: I remember the extreme anxiety I once had that he would never change. That he would go on to hurt another woman, and that to him and his family, I would be the bad guy of our story, even though he physically, sexually and emotionally abused me. It hurt me too that I'd gotten so attached to his family, and that I would also be the bad guy to them -- I don't have any, and I often unintentionally seek one out. When you're around people a ton for a year and a half, you begin to become invested in their stories and lives.

I remembered all of that. And then I remembered that now, I couldn't care any less than I already do about him. It was a long 3 months of me almost not being functional at all and having constant panic attacks when passing anywhere that was an old haunt of ours (when he dumped me, I had to live in a homeless shelter even though he played a part in me becoming homeless -- I was 18. I am 21 now). But then I moved away from that city (Houston) and lived somewhere else and it helped in me getting over it. I met someone new, and I cried here and there, but 3 years later, it doesn't hurt at all anymore.

Today, I'm in a program for software development that really does everything for the people that enter. For 6 months you learn something tech related (I'd already had some web dev experience before coming in) and then for 6 months after that, they send you on an internship with a Fortune 500 company -- 90% of students that finished are hired either on their internship or during the 4 months of job placement help they give you after you graduate. I'm receiving a stipend while I attend that isn't much, but it covers my half of rent and a bit more. Something I've been considering lately is relocation... for those that are willing and that do particularly well, some companies are willing to make an offer and pay for your relocation if the location they're at doesn't have the space to hire someone for your role, but an out of state location does. I'm genuinely considering doing this, because I am actually financially dependent on my boyfriend (this is part of why he's able to abuse me) and this would kind of... force me to leave him. I also got hit by a car while on my moped 2 months ago, and as a mixed blessing, it should result in me getting a check through my lawyer from the case. I'm hoping it'll be alot so it'll give me a safety cushion. As a narcissist, he's fantastic at convincing me that he's going to change when he never does. I recognize that I'm really bad at recognizing when people are genuine or when they aren't. And he's mad some changes here and there since we've gotten together, but I'm just seriously doubting it'll ever be at the rate it needs to be or that he'll ever completely change. He's great at roping me back in, and if he keeps doing this, I'll end up marrying this guy, I know it.

I'm terrified of being alone Mom... I have no parents, and no family really (My mother was physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive. My father was never present). I'm not that great at making friends because people my own age don't have remotely the level of responsibility I do (taking care of bills, not spending my money or time drinking because I don't have anyone to come get me and help me if I go overboard, etc.) and I can't relate to a lot of older people either... so I have problems being alone. It'll be just me. I was a serial monogamist (something I DON'T want to do again) before I met my SO because that's usually the only kind of re-enforcing touch/emotional re-assurance I can get from anyone. I'm scared, too, because as a woman, I know we get targeted a lot for burglaries and that sort of thing.  I've also felt bad because he's given me a lot (to lots of moaning and bitching and groaning about how he does sooo much for me and would rather not be) and the plan was for me to pay the almost 5k back to him. But I'm feeling like that will 1.) break me financially to do, and 2.) he's never worked on paying me back emotionally in the fact that I've been his emotional punching bag and have been carrying this relationship for the last 2 years. I pointed this out to him, and he's pretty much let me know without saying it directly that that's not nearly as important as tangible money.

But my point is... I know that this (this relationship) is wrong. I know that I can't keep this up. How do you all deal with being alone (and for the ladies, living alone), and how do I deal with these feelings of guilt I'm having? Of leaving his family too (his nieces have been around me for 2 years now since they were both 2 years old and refer to me as their aunt)? I feel really alone, and really scared to take what I feel is this enormous step into the deep on my own."
9minc0,22,2018-10-08,[NA] October 1-7 Week Recap,Tomahawkeye12,boxoffice,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/9minc0/na_october_17_week_recap/,"**Happy Monday everyone! This is a continuation of my dailies posts that recap and analyze box office for Mondays-Thursdays. To be clear, these recaps are for Monday-Sunday gross, not for a Friday-Thursday box office week. Additionally, to stay focused, these updates will look solely at the films I’ve been running comps on. Today, I’ll provide full-week updates on *Smallfoot*, *Night School*, *The House with a Clock in its Walls*, *A Simple Favor*, *The Nun*, *Crazy Rich Asians*, *The Predator*, and *Mission: Impossible – Fallout*.**

**As time goes on and this list grows larger, I’ll start phasing out films that are nearing the end of their runs, or perhaps just do a lightning round with total projections. That could start next week for *Fallout*, *The Predator*, *Crazy Rich Asians*, and *The Nun*. For now, let’s do a dive into each of these films!**

- *Smallfoot* had a bad week for our comps, all of which are nearly identical in terms of target audience and release date. These comps should mean something. For the full week, it ran at 112% of *Storks*, 64% of *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*, 56% of *Hotel Transylvania*, and 95% of *Open Season*. These comps give us a projected total of $80-85m. *Open Season* is obviously the closest comp so far, and that trajectory would give us $79m.

- *Night School* had a mediocre week for our comps, especially against the Summer releases, and the weekend wasn’t strong enough to make it for it. For the full week, it ran at 84% of *Ride Along 2*, 59% of *Central Intelligence*, and 58% of *Girls Trip*. The trajectory of those films places us between $73-$87m, which is obviously a massive range and tells us almost nothing. If I had to guess, I’d put it at the higher end of that range. Maybe $83-86m.

- *The House with a Clock in its Walls* is slipping. For the full week, it ran at 79% of *Goosebumps* and 70% of *Miss Peregrine*. This is after running 91% and 82% of these films, respectively, for the previous week. The projected total based on the trajectory of these films is $73-76m. All in all, the movie is having a pretty boring box office run so far, and I’m having a hard time finding interesting things to say about it.

- *A Simple Favor* is also running out of steam. For the full week, it ran at 65% of *The Intern* and 100% of *I Feel Pretty*. Those are both significantly lower than the previous week comps. We still can’t nail down a projected total for this one, and these 2 films give us $54-63m. Wherever it lands in that range, it’s a smash hit with a budget of only $20m. Let’s say $60m for now.

- *The Nun* held mostly steady in our comps. For the full week, it ran at 62% of *The Conjuring*, 109% of *Conjuring 2*, 150% of *Annabelle*, and 63% of *Annabelle: Creation*. These films give us a projected total of $116-$122m. No matter where it lands, this is an absolute blockbuster for the genre. Due to the awful critical reception and middling audience reception, this run pays testament to the strength of the brand.

- *Crazy Rich Asians* has taken a nosedive in our comp of *The Help*, as I noted all throughout the week. For the full week, it ran at only 73% of *The Help*, after excellent comps of 91% and 96% the previous 2 weeks. After a projected total of $180m for ages, we’re now looking at $177m. This movie is still an amazing success, and we shouldn’t take anything away from that. One of the most exciting box office runs of all time.

- *The Predator* is just depressing at this point. For the full week, it ran at 84% of *Predators*, 57% of *Alien: Covenant*, and 24% of *Kingsman 2*. These are all significant drops from the previous week comps. It crawled over $50m yesterday. Our projected total is $52-$56m based on these films, and it’ll definitely be on the lower end of that range… if not below the range entirely. Boo. 

- *Mission: Impossible – Fallout* has almost made it, fam. It’s at $219.75m, so $220m is obviously happening (as I’ve been saying for ages). It had a mediocre weekend with the screen count drop, but for the full week, it ran at 135% of *Rogue Nation*. That’s easily the best week for the comp so far. Our projected total is $220m.

**Tomorrow I’ll roll out comps for *Venom* (*The Martin*, *Gravity*, *Thor 2*, *Doctor Strange*) and *A Star is Born* (*The Martian*, *Gravity*, *Gone Girl*). Many thanks to users who offered suggestions in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/9m7m84/na_comp_suggestions_for_venom_and_a_star_is_born/)**

**Have a good week!**"
9mits7,6,2018-10-08,Hogwarts Ambassador to the Ministry,brieboone_potions,PotterPlayRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/PotterPlayRP/comments/9mits7/hogwarts_ambassador_to_the_ministry/,"*Just before dinner, all students and staff are asked to assemble in the Great Hall. Headmistress Boone stands at her podium at the head of the hall, the staff seated behind her. There are also three unfamiliar faces, sitting at a smaller round table set beside the staff, whispering quietly to each other until the Headmistress begins her announcement.*

“As I announced at the start of term, this year we are hosting some special guests from the Ministry of Magic, who are heading up a competition to decide which student will be selected as Hogwarts Ambassador to the Ministry. The winner of this competition will also receive a Ministry internship in the Department of their choosing, and a monetary prize of 1,000 Galleons.”

“The first in this series of ~~unfortunate~~ events will take place on Friday November 2nd, after classes have concluded for the day. As you may have noticed, guests from the Ministry have already arrived to join us here tonight. Theodore Farrier, Edith Bisset, and Anastasie Poirier.” *Headmistress Boone says, gesturing to the table of Ministry officials seated beside the staff.*

“They will be three of the judges of this competition, and one more will be arriving shortly before the first event. In the next few weeks leading up to the events, these judges will be around the castle, possibly sitting in on classes, practices, or clubs that the competitors may be a part of.”

“Now, on to the announcement of who will be partaking in this competition, which I’m sure is what most of you are anxious to hear about. Two students were selected from each house, and will be representing their fellow students in this competition.”

“From Ravenclaw; Edward Seymour and Nathaniel Barrett.”

“From Slytherin; April Teal and Carina Barzetti.”

“From Gryffindor; Jayce Evans and Bernadette Hollister.”

“And finally, from Hufflepuff; Joseph Aguilar and Beatrice Saunders.”

*With a simple tap of her wand, each competitors name appeared in the air, in their respective house colors, as they were announced, fizzling out after a minute.*

“Congratulations to those of you who were selected, I hope you will represent your fellow students well before the Ministry, and I wish you all the best of luck.” *The Headmistress says with a proud smile before stepping back from the podium.* 

*At that time, dinner appears on the tables, and music begins to float into the hall- seemingly from nowhere. The enchanted ceiling also puts on a bit of a light show as dinner commences, the stars twinkling different colors amid fireworks in each houses respective colors.*

But in around May it hit me really hard. I couldn't go to university anymore, attempted suicide, stopped eating, etc. And then I started to read this sub and it really helped me. Knowing that I am not alone with my struggles and that it doesn't really care on how someones life situation is to become depressed really helped me (I know this sounds a little morbid).

But now I am on my internship and actually start to feel slightly better and can sometimes even look forward to the way that lies ahead. Sure I screwed up pretty good the last half year (need to start a new bachelor thesis) but at least I feel fine.

Was wondering if you guys could give me an idea of my chances at NEU.   

My stats are the following: 3.60 UW GPA, 4.02 W GPA, 33 ACT, 800 SAT Math II, 12 APs/Honors by the end of senior year. Some notable APs related to major include Physics 1, Physics C Mech, Comp Sci, Calc AB, Calc BC, and Program design and development (taken at CC).

Some of my extracurriculars include 2 years basketball and football, LD Debater, created a non-profit for tutoring kids in low-income neighborhoods (taught coding as well) and raised almost a thousand dollars which were donated to various charities, created a website which educated people on blockchain, and work as an intern at a tech startup. 

I realize that my GPA is pretty low, but I think that my ECs are pretty unique and can hopefully help out my application a bit. 

I intend on majoring in computer engineering."

But what made me a legend was the massive cock between my legs, difficult to conceal when soft, impossible to ignore hard.  And of course, and endless appetite to match my impressive endowments.

I came into my own in college, gaining a domineering attitude as I fucked my way through the girl's dorms and raided sororities, breaking the wills of every good girl I came across.  Whole teams fell to me and would regularly have me join them in the locker rooms after practice.

After school, I wouldn't slow down, taking every cute secretary, coworker, client's wife or intern that crossed my path.  You can get away with that if every woman in HR is sending you dirty, begging texts.

I love showing off, so of course my snap chat, twitter, and instagram are full of provocative, teasing photos of me and my conquests.  My phone is constantly buzzing with texts and pics from girls I've fucked and those who have somehow gotten my number and want a taste.  Cam shows and live streaming have become a great second source of income, though if I'm being honest, I'd do it for free.

So yes, this is over the top and ridiculous. That's the vibe I want and would love for you to embrace.  So where do you fit in? Are we back in college? Do you spy me in the gym? Are you the wife or daughter of one of my clients? Do you have some other idea? I love brainstorming scenes, so feel free to come with ideas or characters and we can build something.

Also, just because we're going crazy doesn't mean we need to skimp on details or rush through things.  I love teasing and slow build ups.  Good dialog is always a plus.

Other kinks I'm into but are not required: incest, BDSM, exhibition, public sex, lots of cum, overly endowed partners, penis and breast growth, penis pumps and cock rings, drugs

I ETS in 3 years. Do not plan on reenlisting. I have a potential offer from a decent international data consulting firm for an internship. The internship can last up to 9 months, sometimes even being 6 months depending on how they feel your work is. They would place me in their Chicago offices afterwards. Overall it is a great opportunity to get some experience, make some money abroad, and will open doors for me after graduation.

&amp;#x200B;

My predicament is I'm currently enlisted and do not know of how I could work around this. I know people leave the guard temporarily when they do religious missionary trips (LDS). I also know of fellow battles missing drill due to being in the police academy, which lasted for months at a time. I want to know if anyone has knowledge on these types of situations. I'm not trying to stay in the guard, want to fulfill my contract in the most honorable way possible, and just want some direction from people who have done something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, anything constructive will help and be appreciated. It's not official, but if I do get an offer which seems possible, I want to know what kind of uphill battle I will be facing.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I may get a job offer abroad for less than a year, need to know if I theres anything I can do to be able to do it, while not going AWOL."

When we have to buy something we tell Ed, and he takes care of all of the necessary chemical clearances and purchasing orders. So me and the other intern are discussing graphite pads, and are wondering if we need a chemical clearance for it.  So we go talk to Ed and he says maybe we can get a sample for free.  Ed likes to joke around and says ""this might be sexist, but..."" then says some joke about how I should call them up and flirt with them to get a sample.  He imitated the hair throw and the sexy voice and neither of us laugh.  I was very uncomfortable and neither of us thought it was funny.  

So I go about my day then when I get home from work this is the only thing on my mind.  This stupid little joke made me feel like he was insinuating that I wasn't good enough at my job to just ask for a sample, and that I would have to resort to my ""feminine wiles"" to get it done.  It was really bugging me.  So I decide that the next day I should go and talk to him about it.  I plan what I should say in my head, and I tell him that it is progress that he recognized that something he was about to say was sexist, but if you realize that just don't say it! He apologized to me, but when I confronted him I was holding back tears.  I was very upset, but glad that he took it to heart.  

So today I get a message from Ed's manager.  He calls me into a room and asks me what happened and I tell him about this stupid little joke and I get really upset and end up crying a little.  I said there is no need for HR, I am fully confident that Ed got the message and won't make jokes like this again but I was just so embarrassed that I cried in front of a manager it made me feel off for the rest of the day.  

I always thought that I would be this badass bitch and call people out on their sexism in a powerful way with no show emotion when I did it.  I feel so stupid for making a big deal about it and crying in front of a higher up.  

TL;DR: Guy made a sexist joke, I called him out on it the next morning being visibly upset.  Then his manager asked me what happened, if I wanted HR to get involved, said no, and I cried.  I'm feeling upset and embarrassed that I made such a big deal about it and showed so much emotion.    "

Two of my roommates are in the middle of unpaid internships and can barely afford to pay the rent already, nevertheless with one less roommate.  
Everyone in the house is a really close knit group of friends, including another guy (we’ll call him C). 
C and his ex girlfriend (we’ll call her R) had split up earlier this year and the group remained relatively close to R.  Not like we were hanging out all the time, but everyone was on a talking basis, including C.  
R and I were talking one day and she told me that she needed a place to live because her parents were divorcing and they were selling the house.  I told her she can have the room if I okay’d it with the rest of the house.  After talking with the house, we came to the fact that we would rather it not be her that moves in but we don’t really have a choice as far as money goes and she was desperate for a place to live. 

Now today, I told C.  He apparently heard the news from a mutual friend was pissed that no one told him sooner.  He said I was being a shitty friend for inviting her to room with us because “I’m letting his ex move in”.  We had heated argument and he concluded with a half ass apology. 

And that’s it, he didn’t really have any other reason for being upset except for the fact that it was his ex.  It took me by surprise, I honestly didn’t expect his reaction to be that harsh. 

My main question is, am I in the wrong?  Should I apologize for arguing with him and even letting this happen?  I understand this is a shitty situation but my back is against the wall. 

Thank you, guys!

Currently I think I have a problem with my eyes. If someone can help identify it and/or give advices as to what to do with it, I would be glad.

I was fine up until a few months ago. I'm near-sighted, but don't really wear glasses as my vision is not severely impaired (in my country my eyes are Left: 8.5/10, Right: 6/10. IDK how to translate it into something more international). Recently however, my eyes have been finding it hard to focus on things that are repetitive or tightly arranged (imagine a bed of leaves, lots of parallel lines, things like that). I initially ignored it, but when I picked up a book to read, the problem shows itself up, preventing me from reading without getting dizzy (not really dizzy, but it is hard to explain). Should I get my eyes checked?   
I think the problem stems from my summer internship, where I did 2 months of office work looking at a computer screen near 8hrs a day. Before this summer I can read and see parallel/repetitive things fine, but even when I was working sometimes I would feel like my focus is being distracted when I'm looking at a lot of lines of text.   


Thanks for any help.

""Three wishes?"" He considered, ""That's not how it works?""

""So genies can't grant wishes?"" I reacted.

Well that sucks. The one time I actually buy something at that bootlegged imitation of a pawnshop across the river, I get a magic lamp. Not that I was looking for such a thing. I just thought for once, 'you know what? That's a nice ass lava lamp.'

Your boy doesn't even really get down with lava lamps. But, it was a really nice looking lamp. Said it was energy saving too, so hey, save the environment by buying a stupid novelty item?

That's a pro decision.

Of course, it was a little dusty, so I wiped it down to give that shine it's supposed to have.

And now I'm stuck with him.

I should probably explain better.

The person I'm talking about isn't normal by any stretch. Oh no, that would be too easy. Ahmet here is a genie. Yes, that's right a genie. Apparently, he's been imprisoned in this lamp for quite a while longer than one would want to be. And if you ever watched Aladdin as a kid; you probably realized *exactly* when I fucked up.

So, after classical introductions (""Mortal, you have freed me from my slumber, yadda-yadda-yadda, blah-blah-blah."" I'm rocking in the fetal position by the way.), I realized: Hey, it's a genie.

You get three wishes. You can change your whole life if he's legit.

But what if he's like dude from the Wishmaster? Or that old story, the Monkey's Paw? Or the Leprechaun??

If it sound too good to be true. It probably is. Which brings us back to where we started.

""I'll grant you a wish for every wish that you grant me.""

""You're a genie. And I have to grant you wishes?""

""You get yours in return.""

""Is there a limit?""

""Whenever you say we're done, is when we're done.""

""...How am I going to grant you a wish? Is there a magic phrase? Am I an intern. I don't get it.""

Look man, I'll tell you what I wish for, and you tell me what you wish for. And we just meet in the middle. It's that simple.""

""Okay, who goes first?""

""You then me.""

""Alright then."" I paused, ""I wish I had no student debt.""

""I wish I was a mortal again.""

He didn't understand why I didn't grant him that one.

""Why, so you can run off after one wish?""

""You do not understand the life of a genie."" Ahmet dictated, ""My life is a complex and daunting one.""

""Bro, you're a genie. You can use magic all day, everyday. You're not missing anything being normal. Trust me, I live it everyday. Besides, it can't be that bad to be a genie.""

""...You ever try to beat yo' dick; then look down and remember you're a cloud from the waist down?""

""I- *Oh shit*. I figured you could... I didn't think you didn't have legs.""

""I have legs but it's not like I have the opportunity to take a stand in life.""

""Oh my God.""

""God has damned me enough.""

""Ok, ok. Give me something other than being mortal.""

""I wish I had the rest of my body back.""

""May your wish be granted.""

And just like that, Ahmet had legs. I'm a genie for a genie now. *This is legendary.*

""Thank you!"" He cried out, ""This is great!""

I let him have a moment, because hey, I'd be happy to have half my body come back too if that were the case.

""I..."" He halted, ""I... I'm sorry, what was your again?""

""Clear my student loans!""

""Fine, my friend. May your wish be granted.""

He was legit. Ten minutes later I'm legally a free man when it comes to all the debt weighing this country down.

""Thanks man!"" I rejoiced happily.

""So what's next?""

""...I wish I was a physical being again!""

I just looked at him this time.

""What??""

""Are you going to try to become normal all night? Because I can wait."""
9mn8rd,1,2018-10-09,My experience of learning CCNA to CCIE,spotoccie,CCIEStudy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIEStudy/comments/9mn8rd/my_experience_of_learning_ccna_to_ccie/,"  

When I first learned CCNA, I was a little scared, because when I first learned about the configuration manual and study guide, it was just a lot of commands and some knowledge that needed to be understood. After learning CCNA, I start CCNP curriculum, which is harder than CCNA, also need to spend more time.

When I started to learn CCNP, my learning is poor, CCNP is more experimental than CCNA, and because my naughty often fail, so the completion of the experiment also needless to say, at that time I also signed up for SPOTO BOOTCAMP classes during the summer.

Now think back to the BOOTCAMP course at the time is still very useful, such as the project drill course, we are divided into 4 groups, the project bidding simulation, during the learning how to make PPT, draw network topology, etc., these will be used in corporate work, There are also some very useful courses in AAA, ACS, IOS upgrade, device password recovery and so on.  

When I finished the [CCIE Security lab dumps BOOTCAMP](https://cciers.spoto.net/ccie-security.php) course, I took the CCNP certificate in the third year of my junior year, and then I left the university for an internship. During this period, I interviewed several companies, but I did not go because of the low salary. In march, after I return from shenzhen to fujian, formally started in fuzhou CCIE study course, first of all, I said I'm CCIE study method, I was a full-time study, there are a lot of learning time, in every time before class, I will go over the CCIE thematic teaching video, and using the word record notes, write down do not understand the problem first, and then ask the teacher.        

It took me about eight hours to practice the version for the first time, and I had to say it was a bit of a blow to my confidence, but I didn't give up, so I typed it almost twice a day, and it was a little bit slow at first, almost always until about two o 'clock in the middle of the night, sometimes even longer. In this way, after about 16 practices, I could control the version time to about 3 hours only based on the demand. Some people may worry about the 3 hours for a long time. In fact, most of the examination rooms are preconfigured.      

For TS on this, my conclusion is: follow the teacher's training video is no problem, if you can in a few minutes, the test is no problem, the teacher training has been contains all possible fault point, anyway, that's what I do, one thing to note is that never rote learning, be sure you understand!!!!!      

After more than a month of hard work, I finally went to the examination room. A few days before the examination, I did not do any more exercises. I just watched the examination room feedback and collected information. The change was not very big. The fault diagnosis changed, but my teacher gave Solved, the teacher is very powerful. The day of the exam was also very smooth. There was no change. It was similar to what I usually practiced. The version I was pumping was H1+, the spanning tree was H1, and I finally got my CCIE number. "

I told her to let me know when she could. 

She then asks me “I want us to do something during Christmas. Can you tell me when you’ll be back from London” (my home town, but I live in France)

I guess that’s a good sign, that she’s planning things in the future. 

I just think she needs space right now to focus on her work. If she finds the time to see me then great, I just don’t want to make the same mistakes that I’ve made in past relationships...

Zaken en Werkgelegenheid over het recht op onbereikbaarheid &amp;#40;ingezonden 6  
september 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
Bent u bekend met het artikel ‘Lidl pakt intern e-mailen aan: 's avonds en  
in weekend komen mails niet aan’?[1]  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
   
2  
Deelt u de mening dat stress- en burn-outklachten bij werknemers een van de  
grootste ziekmakers is? Bent u ook van mening dat het nog steeds van belang  
is om de gevaren van werkstress onder de aandacht te brengen bij werknemers  
en werkgevers? Wat is daarom de overweging om te stoppen met de  
bewustwordingscampagne over werkstress?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit onderzoek van TNO blijkt dat psychosociale arbeidsbelasting de grootste  
oorzaak van ziekte door werk is &amp;#40;NEA 2017[2]&amp;#41;. Een hoge werkdruk,  
ongewenste omgangsvormen als pesten, seksuele intimidatie en agressie en  
geweld zijn voorbeelden van zaken die kunnen leiden tot stress en burn-out.  
Het ministerie van SZW heeft de afgelopen jaren intensief ingezet op  
bewustwording rond werkstress onder werkgevers en werknemers en heeft hen  
ondersteund bij het nemen van maatregelen, onder meer door het verspreiden  
en ontwikkelen van goede voorbeelden en handreikingen. Met deze  
bewustwordingscampagne is ingezet op agendering, nu komt het erop aan om  
concrete verbeteringen binnen organisaties te realiseren. Dit is ook al  
steeds vaker het geval. In 2014 nam 69% van de werkgevers maatregelen op  
dit gebied, in 2016 was dit 77%[3]. Maar we zijn er nog niet.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is aan werkgevers en werknemers om continu met elkaar in gesprek te  
zijn en waar nodig actie te ondernemen om werkstress te voorkomen. Dit  
blijf ik ondersteunen met gerichte activiteiten. Bijvoorbeeld door  
relevante instrumenten en informatie te delen via het Arboportaal, het  
organiseren van bijeenkomsten rondom ongewenst gedrag op het werk in het  
najaar en diverse activiteiten ter ondersteuning van de rol en positie van  
vertrouwenspersonen. Tevens laat ik onderzoek uitvoeren op het gebied van  
gedragscodes en naar de oorzaken van de verhoogde kans op burn-out bij een  
aantal groepen. Daarnaast ondersteun ik de branche-organisatie OVAL  
&amp;#40;Organisatie voor Vitaliteit, Activering en Loopbaan&amp;#41; en TNO die dit jaar  
gezamenlijk de Week van de Werkstress organiseren, om ook bewustwording te  
blijven stimuleren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
Deelt u verder de mening dat de toename van stress- en burn-outklachten  
onder andere komt door de toenemende druk om continue bereikbaar te zijn?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Mijn inschatting is dat dit hieraan bij zou kunnen dragen, maar concrete  
cijfers hierover zijn mij niet bekend. In 2017 heeft TNO, in overleg met  
mijn ministerie, een verkennende studie[4] gedaan naar het onderwerp  
technostress. Dit onderzoek heeft aan de hand van een aantal experts de  
problematiek verkend. Causale relaties zijn nog niet aangetoond.   
4  
Hoe kijkt u aan tegen het recht op onbereikbaarheid zoals bij Lidl in  
België en Luxemburg of bij BMW en Volkswagen in Duitsland wordt ingevoerd?  
Bent u bereid om met voorlopende bedrijven in Nederland in gesprek te gaan  
om te kijken of zij een voorbeeldrol kunnen aannemen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
Constaterende dat er in Frankrijk een wettelijk recht op onbereikbaarheid  
bestaat, bent u bereid om te onderzoeken of een dergelijk recht op  
onbereikbaarheid ook voor Nederlandse werknemers een manier is om stress  
tegen te gaan? Bent u bovendien bereid om het recht op onbereikbaarheid met  
sociale partners te bespreken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vragen 4 en 5  
Een aanpak tegen werkstress is maatwerk. Maatregelen zoals Lidl die in  
België en Luxemburg heeft genomen, kunnen een manier zijn om met  
technostress om te gaan, maar dit hoeft niet bij alle werkgevers en voor  
alle werknemers de oplossing te zijn.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik juich het toe als werkgevers en werknemers gezamenlijk in gesprek zijn  
en blijven en komen tot effectieve maatregelen. Ook als het gaat om  
technostress zal deze dialoog vooral gevoerd moeten worden op de werkvloer.  
Het onderzoek van TNO uit 2017 geeft aan dat in deze tijd werkgevers en  
werknemers ‘in co-creatie’ zouden moeten zoeken naar afleidingsvrije  
momenten en gezamenlijk heldere afspraken zouden moeten maken over omgang  
met e-mail en smartphones. Want, zoals het rapport stelt, het gaat  
bijvoorbeeld bij de druk om altijd maar online te zijn vaak niet om  
daadwerkelijke regels, maar om aannames en verwachtingen, zonder dat hier  
het gesprek over wordt gevoerd.  
Een gesprek hierover met de sociale partners lijkt mij niet aangewezen. De  
sociale partners kunnen wel bevorderen dat werkgevers en werknemers  
hierover met elkaar in gesprek gaan.

Kunt u deze vragen beantwoorden voor het debat over de toename van het  
aantal mensen met een burn-out?

Father used to be rich long time ago but he lost it all because of negligence and not trusting the right people. Parents started taking care of father's brother's children along with us, while I was in school, since his brother turned out to be a bigger narcissist than my parents ever were.  Maybe I was jealous but it always felt like my parents cared for them more than they did for us. Whatever was left from my dad's savings he took it and invested in starting a business for my cousin and my cousin ignored my parents once the business took off and did not return the money he took from my dad. We literally had to move from a huge house to a small house in the same town. My ndad then quit his job because he listened to some people who told him he was meant to do better things. Things spiralled down from there. My ndad and nmom started fighting everyday and blaming each other for the state that they were in. My nbrother started using this as a reason for everything he did. I felt for my brother since I knew what he was going through and tried to defend him and all his wrongdoings. My nmom and ndad started telling me that only I can get the family out of all this and also it was my responsibility to do so. They stopped me from hanging out with all of my friends. I was only supposed to meet few people who they would approve of. They used to bring in friends who would also judge me for watching TV or playing instead of studying or doing something productive. I had to drop all my dreams of pursuing Phd since it would take more time to complete and stop me from earning money. Also any other thing which would require money. I had to do summer internship during summers instead of spending vacations like my other friends. They used to take all the money i earned through internships and scholarships. Finally after working through this I got a high salary job at a good startup at the final year of my graduation. When I told them about this, they were disappointed because I couldn't land a job at a highly respected company, but still they were happy that I started making money. This is when I found about their true nature. My nmom told me as soon as I told her about the job and pay, that she took a huge loan by pawning her jewellery to help out the same cousin in his new business venture and he again cheated her. Now I was supposed to pay the loan and get her jewellery back. I agreed and started clearing off all the loans my family had and helping out my brother. My nbrother never had a clear aim in mind and used to keep changing it. It used to scientist once, engineer once, doctor once and now he wants to be a film director, but I never said anything still defending him in front of my parents. I wanted him to have all the choices that I couldn't have. He moved to another city to pursue his plans to be a filmmaker. It has been 1 year and all he does is stay home and play games. I bought him a gaming laptop because he wanted a high end laptop for video editing even though I knew he would play games on it.  This went on until last year when my dad had a major heart stroke. He was admitted in hospital. I was living in a separate city so I couldn't immediately reach him. I could only reach the place next day.  All the required formalities were completed by my cousin since I was not available. When I reached all my relatives and my family blamed me for not taking any responsibilities. They told me that I have abandoned my family and enjoying my life in another city. They demanded I move back with my parents and start a job there and take care of them. Trust me I would have if my salary would have met by company at that place. The best offer I could get was a pay cut of 25% and that was not acceptable by my parents. I asked my nbrother to move with them in order to take care of them temporarily until I move there. He did and he said he can't stay with them one month after he moved with them. My nparents and him had a huge fight a railway station at 5am in the morning and he ran away leaving them at the station. I was so scared, I flew from my place to this place and started searching for him. I tracked him down to a place and when I went to meet him, he threatened to kill himself unless we don't meet him. He demanded that I give him money to stay at luxurious hotels if we wanted to stay in touch with him. I gave him credit card and the pin number and my phone. That day was the worst day of my life. He kept moving from hotel to hotel every 6 hours and booking rooms for himself with my money. Finally he got some sense knocked into him and he came back home. He asked not to interfere in him personal matters and help him with family matters and also to keep sending him money for his living expenses. I agreed once again. Since that day every phone call gives me anxiety since I don't know what happened this time.

I am 25 years old now living alone with no friends. I have huge debt for a house I hate and a car I never get to use and loans for money that I could have used to have a better life. I have tried to get out many times but I failed immediately. The only reason that makes sense to me is that I still love them after all that they have done to me. I tried talking about this to one of my childhood friend, he denied all these and called me a Narc because I am making all this up to grab some attention. Since then, I have been too scared to talk about this to any of my good friends. The slight chance of me being a narc makes me feel like I am also my parents and I hate that feeling. I am so glad that I found this page. I am not seeking advice or anything. I just wanted to get this out."
9mq3ht,0,2018-10-09,My (27F) significant other and I (26M) have been together 6 years and are struggling,notme123456789999,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9mq3ht/my_27f_significant_other_and_i_26m_have_been/,"Hi everyone! I will try and keep this short and I genuinely appreciate your honest feedback. 

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I have been together a long time. We are both atheists, have the same humor, taste in music and food, and genuinely enjoy each others company. We are very goofy and comfortable around each other which I absolutely love. She has a heart of gold and fosters elderly animals so that they can have a home before they pass and I think because of her nurturing nature she will be a great mom to our kids one day.

&amp;#x200B;

We recently moved to another state for a job opportunity for me and have been struggling financially for some time now as I work to make my business successful. Neither of us are particularly fond our our present location, but I know that this is temporary and that we will be better off soon enough. She bought a house in her name that we have had some expensive repairs that she has been less than excited about. ""So notme123456789999, what seems to be the problem? This doesn't seem so bad."" Well let me explain.....

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few complaints that I have been working to address that are big deals for me.  While I love the fact that she has such a big heart this had led us to have between 5-6 dogs at our 900 sq/ft home at a time. This is extremely overwhelming for me even with them being smaller and old. I have tried to explain to her that while I can realistically live with none I am willing to compromise and have a few with the rotating foster. Eventually we will be buying a home with a mother-in-law suite that she can turn into a rescue so that we do not have to have them in our main home. We recently had a dog pass which I was relieved to lower our small population and she immediately went out and got another foster. This is frustrating because I would like to take a little break (even with 5 dogs) . Whenever I try and talk about this she tells me that I am so unsupportive since I do not help with the dogs at all (which is valid because this is her passion and not mine). She also says that she doesn't care how I feel about it because if she doesn't foster the dog then it will die. You definitely cannot save them all, but alas here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

She then will go on to say how the only reason she is living at our present location is because of me and that she hates it here. (She grew up wealthy and doesn't really know what it is like to struggle a bit).  I try and remind her of our long term goals of the larger home and better job, but she is lost in a very short sided view. She claims that the dogs are the only thing that make her happy and that make her want to live. (This make me feel terrible since I would like to be able to be a reason for her happiness.) She hates her job too which doesn't help and she unfortunately can't get anything better because she only has experience in this one field and her degree is wasted without internships (that she doesn't want to go and take).

&amp;#x200B;

Coupled with this our sex life is non-existent. I have been focusing on her love language (acts of servitude), but this does not help at all. I have tried to get her excited with a ""Sunday Funday"", but nothing seems to be working. I feel bad for talking with her about our sex life because I know that it makes her feel bad. (We used to be regular a few times a week). 

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am reddit. I feel as though my opinion does not matter in this relationship, I feel that my partner is not physically into me anymore, and I genuinely feel like I am just being a placeholder for her. When I talk with her she gets angry and tells me to leave if I am so unhappy. I love our goofy relationship, but I just want to feel like an actual partner and not just some person living in her world. There is a reason that I am still with her, but sometimes when she tells me to leave I honestly consider it. My finances and living situation keep me here since I am definitely dependent as I start this business, but I think that I genuinely want to make this work. I really care for this girl; I just need her to see that I need some compromise. Let me know your thoughts and thank you everyone for reading this long post!

&amp;#x200B;

 **TL;DR**: I feel as though I am just a placeholder for my girlfriend instead of an actual partner. How do I move forward?"
9mqwqb,3,2018-10-09,interviews,finalfroggy,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/9mqwqb/interviews/,"So I’m a autistic female in my second year of college (studying Computer Science). I’m really trying hard to land an internship for this summer, but I’m afraid my autism is making this more of a struggle than for the rest of my peers.

I’ve sent in applications to literally every opening for CS-related internships that I’ve come across hoping that at least one will stick at some point.

So far I’ve had two interviews and my next one is coming up tomorrow. The problem is that I struggle so much with the interviews being a mixture of nonverbal or always speaking in pre-planned “scripts”

The interviews are completely draining me. I’ve tried working around my difficulties by compiling a list of pre-planned answers to as many possible interview questions that I can find. But it’s hard to remember them all once I’m face-to-fave with someone. And I struggle terribly with forming answers for questions I hadnt already prepared for.

Because of this, I really blew my first interviews and its so frustrating because I know I’m capable of doing the actual work (and so far, I haven’t made it past any behavioral interviews so I don’t get to show it).

Do any of you have any advice? How did any of you guys with communication difficulties manage to land a job/internship? Or am I just doomed?"

Last night I had 2 different dreams and woke up once.  I’m just going to go over the briefest details because my dreams are extremely vivid and detailed. Please let me know if you have any idea why I’m seeing this stuff or why I’m so damn prone to nightmares

In the first dream my boyfriend and I fell to our death in an elevator.  The whole dream I was an intern in a hospital dealing with patients and treating them.

The second one was extremely long.
I felt a lot of very real pain that couldn’t be explained by my leg falling asleep or something like that.

My dad choked me
I skinned a man and restarted his brain he was basically just a head at one point moaning in pain.
Incest. I was watched by a family member as they masterbated with other men. They would steal my clothes and cum in them and basically sold my clothing around the city I live in.
I made a play where I was a deer and it was about nature, and femininity.
An art exhibit when wrong and exploded. I could hear people underground screaming as they died
I was almost forced to chop the heads off live babies but the babies were burned so badly their skin was charcoaled.
Finally I had to lock myself in a white room with 3 door and tried to call 911 while my parents tried to kill me. 
This dream involved a lot of violence towards me that was very painful. I also killed and maimed people.

Why is this happening? I have very vivid nightmares that often include pain and death. Pain that feels very real.  What wrong with me?!?

9mrn7c,198,2018-10-09,Crazy Jake,pizzamyheart28,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/9mrn7c/crazy_jake/,"Six years ago I had just graduated nursing school I had not gotten my certification yet so while I studied and waited for my test date, I worked as a CNA. I was living with my fiancee who is now my DH but he had just graduated from school with his sports broadcasting degree and was working a paid internship which paid like crap. So we were living in a one bedroom apartment in a not so great neighborhood.

The complex also was section eight housing as well as housed offenders when they  got out of the local prison, something we did not learn until after we had already lived there a few months.

However we befriended many of the residents, our neighbors to the right a young single mother on section 8 with 2 kids who worked two jobs became a very good friend we still keep in contact with to this day. Our neighbor to the left was a ex con, a guy named Ramon that worked at a bakery. He often brought us bread and donuts that he got from work.

Then Jake moved in, he resided in the unit across from us. I was home the day he moved in, I was outside our apartment sitting in a folding chair reading a magazine enjoying the nice spring day. 

First thing I noticed was he had a electric monitoring bracelet on, he also was a scary looking guy. He was only five eight but had long greasy blond hair, a pockmarked face and his facial tattoos put post malone to shame.

&amp;#x200B;

He saw me sitting there as he moved things into his house and he came over to where I was sitting, I grabbed my magazine to go into the house and he started talking to me. Just polite things, and so I decided to be nice even though my red flag meter was going off. He introduced himself as Jake, and I gave him my nickname. No my actual name but what others call me.  He started asking me if i lived alone, and other more personal things so I gave a hasty answer of no my fiancee lived here as well then excused myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed he was still standing out there just staring at my door, so i quickly closed the shades and went to watch TV. Later on when my fiance was home, I told him about Jake and how he was staring. My fiance told me to just be careful and that he would walk me in from work as we both left at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

For a while things were good, I never saw Jake and i think Fiancee ran into him once. Then I ended up passing my nursing exam, I also got a better paying job. Fiancee was hired by the network he was interning for. Things were looking up and we found an apartment we could afford in a nicer part of town, with a doorman and everything.

We bid adieu to the complex and the friends we had made there and moved into our new place. I thought my days of ever seeing Jake again was over.

One day while working my job in the busy ER I saw a familiar face, it was Jake he had taken an overdose of meds and was on a 24 hour observation. There was not a room available for him so he was kept in the ER. I went in to take his vitals and he recognized me he then went off on me about how I moved out with out saying goodbye and how much he missed me. Just crazy things being that we barely knew each other and had really only talked that one time.

&amp;#x200B;

I explained myself to the charge nurse and she got someone else to babysit him as I did not feel comfortable. After my shift I headed out to my car and I was about to get in when I saw Jake walking briskly towards me. I got in my car, locked the car and   started it by the time he made his way over. He started hitting the car, banging my trunk and slapping the windows shouting at me to open the god dammed door. I drove off but not before he got one good kick to my bumper.

&amp;#x200B;

I was terrified to go to work and for a while I insisted that security escort me to and from my car. Three months had passed with no sign of Jake I started relazing and I walked to and from my car by myself. 

One day I am heading to my car when someone bumps into me, like they were trying to bump my hip but i am tiny only 5 foot 2 and was  110 pounds at the time so I lost my balance and went flying. I twist my ankle and im grabbing it when I look up ready to tell whomever did it off when I see its Jake. His hair had been cut but he looked manic, and he was staring weirdly at me. I hit the panic button on my car and he took off running.

&amp;#x200B;

After that I went to the police, I got a RO against him. He ended up breaking the RO by approaching me again at work, this time thankfully when I was around several co workers. He ended up going to jail, for breaking the RO and breaking parole. He was released last year according to his parole officer who contacted me. Thankfully we live a state away from there now and he never knew my full name. 

So Jake please lets not meet again "
9mrrbe,1,2018-10-09,How Should I Handle Expected Promotion?,throw-a-way244445,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9mrrbe/how_should_i_handle_expected_promotion/,"Hi Reddit.

Bare with me while I write down my thoughts, I will try to make it as concise as possible.

Recently my work restructured my department.  The structure was global director-regional manager- regional coordinator (me).  The manager dedicated half her time to ""our"" work, and half to another responsibility.  Leadership decided her other work required her full attention, and pulled her from our area.  Now it is just global director-Coordinator (me), and I was asked to pick up her workload, and they would work on delegating some of my simple tasks elsewhere.  What has happened in reality is I picked up her responsibilities, and retained most of mine.

The global director has told me he expects me to get a promotion to regional ""leader"" in January, but no one will be hired to fill the gap. 

Now for the most important part, money.  I currently make $55k.  Accidentally, I was shown a presentation that showed my target salary to be $63k+ next year.  Through my research on Glassdoor and industry publications, the position I am moving into (and now already doing) is typically a $80k-$100k job. I am definitely able to manage the job, but I have less experience than is typically expected for this role.  At first, our VP was worried I was unexperienced for the role, and only gave me a chance because of the director's strong push, but has since become very impressed with the work that do.

I am 24 years old, graduated with my bachelors in Dec. 2016, and will finish my MBA in 6 months.  I now have 3 years experience in this field (intern to analyst to coordinator).  

&amp;#x200B;

What would be the best way to make sure I get a fair shake when it comes to salary?  I have a strong feeling they will sell it as I should be grateful for the opportunity, which I am, but I also don't want to be shorted on salary when I am fully expected to excel in the role. Are there any pointers you can give me to set myself up for the best possible offer?

9ms5xn,0,2018-10-09,Kavanaugh makes rape legal again,ricoue,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/9ms5xn/kavanaugh_makes_rape_legal_again/,"  Newly confirmed Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh’s first day on the court fulfilled the worst fears of the women who opposed him in the period leading up to his confirmation. It was obvious as soon as he strolled into the Supreme Court building Tuesday morning in his brand new robe, blasting UB40’s “Red Red Wine” from his iPhone, that he was blackout drunk at 7:30 AM.

  Before sitting down, he fist bumped Clarence Thomas, saying “my nigga.” Thomas, who like Kavanaugh overcame sexual assault allegations to make it to the SCOTUS bench, responded with the “wink and finger gun” gesture. Kavanaugh sat his phone on the bench, and the UB40 song, on repeat, played throughout the session.

  When Justice Kagan asked if he could “please turn off the music,” Kavanaugh screamed at her: “how about I turn off your music, you fat old yenta cunt!” Kagan did not speak throughout the rest of the session.

  Although there were other cases on the docket, Kavanaugh was only interested in discussing one: Joe v. Diamondstein, the landmark case that is expected result in the legalization of rape in all 50 states.

  “Look,” Kavanaugh said with heavily slurred speech, “I don’t give a fuck what your gay faggot doublenigger list says: I wanna get this rape thing done, and I want it now.”

  “For the future of this country, we have to get these stupid whores in line, and the one goddamn thing that can do it is the physical force of millions of hard cocks coming down on them from the uncastrated white men still left in this country. This is a fucking shitshow. We have seen these whores outside the door of this very building, screaming like vicious motherfucking giant bats, making that sandnigger riot we all saw at the McGregor fight over the weekend look like fun time at the kidde pool,” Kavanaugh said.

  With “Red Red Wine” as blaring theme music, he continued to drunkenly rant for 2 hours about the need to legalize rape immediately, stressing a desire to punish all who oppose him, while often referencing the Saturday night’s Conor McGregor vs Khabib Nurmagomedov fight in Las Vegas.

  “Conor McGregor is a disgrace to the white race, he just let that Paki son of a nigger beat the living fuck out of him, couldn’t even keep his own in the fucking stand up. I mean, I just, wow – it was fucking disgusting, Okay? This guy knows what I’m talking about,” Kavanaugh said, tilting his head and lifting his brow at Justice Thomas.

  “Das rite,” Thomas replied. “He a bitchass muffugguh.”

  “See, right there. A bitch ass mother fucker. Clarence gets it. Clarence, you’re my boy, hit em up,” Kavanaugh said, and reached over to fist bump Thomas, nearly falling off the bench in the process.

  “Now, what in the living fuck…” he paused looking around, “the fuck were we just talking about?”

  “You sed how dem bitches gots to be put in dey place wif da dick,” Thomas reminded him.

  “Yeah, right. McGregor is finished. His fighting days are done – but give him his Constitutional rights to rape women on the street, and he could become a machine for transforming this country back into what the Founders intended: a white male patriarchy,” Kavanaugh said of his fellow drunken, violent Irishman.

  Chief Justice John Roberts did not interfere with Kavanaugh’s drunken ranting, appearing to surrender full control over leadership of the court to its most junior member.

  He smiled and giggled throughout the rant, appearing to thoroughly enjoy Kavanaugh’s words, or perhaps simply being overpowered by his fratboy charisma.

  At one point during his rant, when Justice Kavanaugh took a break to pant, wipe sweat from his face, and down what was left of what appeared to be a gin and tonic, Justice Ginsburg, who was wearing an African tribal necklace over her robe, began to interject an opposing opinion, saying “the laws against rape exist for a reason, and if we allow the law –”

  At that point, Kavanaugh threw the ice from his drink in her face, slammed his gavel on the table, and screamed: “I AM THE LAW!”

  This was followed by other conservative Justices Roberts, Gorsuch and Alito, all consecutively slamming their gavels and screaming “I AM THE LAW!”

  All eyes then turned to Justice Thomas, who after a long, squinting pause, sucked air in through his teeth, smacked his lips and said to the wet Ginsburg, “if a bitch gon make a noise again, dat hawk-face bitch might just get summin more dan ice smacken upside she hawk face,” he pointed his gavel at her menacingly and spit on her, before finally raising the gavel in the air and screaming his own “I AM THE LAW!” He slammed the gavel so hard that it smashed a hole in the bench.

  The four liberal judges of the court looked on in terror at this spectacle, realizing that from this point forward, none of their opinions would even matter. A consensus has been reached by the conservative majority.

  Shortly thereafter, Kavanaugh held up a finger and began gagging, saying “hold… hold on a second…” before leaning over and vomiting on the floor in front of him.

  “Bloody fuck, sorry about that,” he said, quickly amending the statement, adding, “I’m sorry to you, Clarence. And John. Neil.”

  He dry-heaved for a few seconds and then pointed at Justice Alito and said “I’m not sure if I’m sorry to you, because I’m not even sure I know who you are,” before turning to the Jewish members of the court and saying “I’m not sorry to you greasy fucking rats – you deserve this. You should have thought of this before you murdered our Lord and Savior and fucked us all in the ass with your goddamn filthy swindles.”

  “Now get one of those sluts from the back to come clean this up – right fucking now, Kagan, you cunt,” he said, pointing his gavel at Kagan, who began to get up to call someone to clean-up the vomit as Kavanaugh added, “Get the one with the mega-knockers, I wanna see how that bitch can work a mop.”

  During the mopping process, Kavanaugh made continual lewd comments to the bosomy intern and touched her hair. After she’d left, he leaned over to Justice Thomas and said, “see, this is why we need to get this fucking rape case settled – when this shit goes legal, I’m gonna do that little slut like Khabib did Conor.”

  The two again fist-bumped.

  Shortly thereafter, Kavanaugh passed out and began snoring loudly, at which point Justice Roberts dismissed the court.

  It is clear from day one that Kavanaugh is going to be a powerful force in directing the court in a manner that oppresses women, sexual minorities and people of color. Furthermore, it is clear that his appointment has emboldened the other conservative members of the court to act out their true nature.

  Kavanaugh has vowed to not only ensure the legalization of rape, but also to ban abortion, legalize child marriage, legalize domestic violence, end all forms of welfare entitlement, end affirmative action, enact the death penalty for homosexuality and reinstate slavery. With a complacent conservative majority, his ability to do all of this is limited only by his ability to keep from passing out drunk during session.

  This is Brett Kavanaugh’s America now."
9msf85,15,2018-10-09,George Birnbaum of Psy-Group deep in Trump Russia,Puffin_Fitness,RussiaLago,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaLago/comments/9msf85/george_birnbaum_of_psygroup_deep_in_trump_russia/,"**George Birnbaum is deep in Trump-Russia**

George Birnbaum, who ran Psy-Group staffed by Israeli intelligence agents, sought out Rick Gates through Republican operative Eckhart Sager days after Gates joined Trump's campaign (1). 

Just prior to reaching out to Gates, Birnbaum worked on Ben Carson's campaign along with George Papadopoulos (35). When Ben Carson pulled out of his presidential run, he handed Trump plans for voter manipulation in swing states by a company called Inspiration, run by Israeli intelligence agents (41). Shortly after, Birnbaum delivered a presentation on Psy-Group to Gates and Papadopoulos joined team Trump (36). Ben Carson now works as Trump's Secretary of Housing.

Before Ben Carson's campaign, Birnbaum worked as a close advisor to Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel (35). According to Papadopuolos' now-wife, Simona Mangiante, Mueller threatened Papadopoulos of being an unregistered agent of Israel  before Papadopoulos pleaded gulity (37). In June 2017 Birnbaum joined Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, at Avenue Strategies, founded by Lewandowski and Ben Carson's former campaign manager that hired Papadopoulos, Barry Bennett (35). Lewandowski has since stepped down from the firm over scandal (38).

Birnbaum's business partner since 2003, Arhtur Finkelstein (3), also mentored **Roger Stone** since the Nixon re-election campaign(2). Roger Stone worked closely with Donald Trump since the late 80's and on Trump's 2000 run for the presidency (4). Finkelstein also worked for the Trump Organization (2) and mentored Tony Fabrizio who worked as a pollster for Trump's campaign (2).

According to Glenn Simpson's testimony, Arthur Finkelstein worked with both Paul Manafort and Roger Stone in **Ukraine** (5). 

&gt; ...Finkelstein worked with Stone and Manafort in Ukraine in or around 2005, 2006, for the same cast of bad guys.

Finkelstein did polling for Donald Trump's childhood friend, Ron Lauder, heir of the Este Lauder fortune, when Lauder ran unsuccessfully for governor of New York in 1989 (2). Ron Lauder encouraged Benjamin **Netanyahu** to hire Finkelstein for his 1996 run for president of Israel. (6). The two worked together again in 1999 (2).

Ron Lauder is also close with Mikhail Friedman of **Alfa-bank** and, starting in 2003, the Lauder Institute and Alfa-bank joined together to reward foreign companies that invested heavily into Russia (7). In 2006 the award was given to Deutsche Bank. On the board was **Richard Burt** (8), the Russian-oil lobbyist that dined with Jeff Sessions during Trump's 2016 campaign (9). The year prior, in 2005, Deutsche Bank loaned Trump $640 million to construct in new hotel in Chicago (10).

Richard Burt, who worked with George Papadopoulos and Paul Manafort to write Trump's first speech on foreign policy at the Mayflower Hotel hosted by the **Center for the National Interest**, is also on the board for the Center (11)(12). David Keene, another board member at the Center and close friend of Roger Stone (39), also heads the **NRA** and later befriended Russian mobster **Alexander Torshin**, Butina's handler (40). The Center, who's head, Dimitri Simes, visited Putin in February 2015, published an article by Russian spy Maria Butina (13). Later Jared Kushner met Henry Kisslyak and Dimitri Simes at an event hosted by the Center. Soon after Paul Manafort and Rick Gates joined Trump's campaign (14).

In 2014 Ron Lauder visited **Mikhail Friedman and German Khan**, both co-founders of Alfa-bank, in London (15). German Khan's son-in-law was sentenced to 30 days in jail for lying to Mueller about work he did with Paul Manafort (22). The next year, in 2015, Finkelstein founded Danube Group with Arpad Harbony, Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s top advisor, in London just miles from Cambridge Analytica and Wikileaks (16). Arthur Finkelstein (2) and George Birnbaum (3) worked closely with pro-Putin Orban, the first EU leader to support Trump (17). 

Ron Lauder met with Putin April 2016 (18) and has done business with Russian oligarchs **Lev Leviev** (19) and **Roman Abramovich** (20). In 2006 Trump hosted the wedding of Rotem Rosen, CEO of Lev Leviev's Africa-Israel US branch, at Mar-a-Lago. In 2007, Trump attended Rosen's bris hosted by Lev Leviev (21). When Michael Cohen was due in court, he instead hung out with Rotem Rosen and Deutsche Bank's former CFO of the division that made that 2005 loan to Trump, **Jerry Rotunda**. The two have since joined forces and founded MRR developments (23).

In April 2014 Betsy DeVos' Amway partnered with Alfa-bank to launch the Alfa-Amway Program that included a joint debit card (34). In September 2016, **Erik Prince**, Betsy DeVos' brother, introduced the head of Psy-Group, **Joel Zamel, to Don Jr. and George Nader** at Trump Tower (24). In 1998 George Nader teamed up with Ron Lauder to help Netanyahu in failed negotiations with Syria (25). 

Erik Prince has worked closely with Russia's favorite congressman, **Dana Rohrabacher**, through Rohrabacher's right-hand-man, Paul Behrends, who helped Prince get an internship with Rohrabacher back in 1990, and in 1997 when Prince founded Blackwater, Behrends became his primary lobbyist (26). Behrends later worked for the Alexander Strategy Group, which was forced to close down due to its connections to Jack Abramoff who was embroiled in scandal at the time (27). One of Abramoff's top clients was Russia state-owned Gazprom (28). Abramoff had worked closely with Manafort during the Reagan administration.

Paul Behrends, joined by Dana Rohrabacher, met with Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin in St. Petersburg August 2015 (29). Paul Behrends has since been **Peter Thiel's** closest confidant and arranged for Thiel to meet with Orban's senior advisor during the 2016 Republican National Convention (26). Peter Thiel is close with Erik Prince (30) and served on Trumps transition (31). Thiel, before founding Pay Pal with Ukrainian computer scientist Max Levchin, was a political operative that wrote speeches for former Education Secretary under HW Bush William Bennett (32). When he founded Paypal, his first investor was Deutsche Bank (32). In January 2013 Max Levchin, representing Thiel's Founder's Fund, was spotted hanging out with some of the major players of Trump-Russia, including the CEO of Alpha-Bank Ukraine and Herman Gref of US Sanctioned Sberbank (33).

9msso3,3,2018-10-09,My SO [31M] doesn't stop co-worker from being inappropriate with me [27F],minionmehappy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9msso3/my_so_31m_doesnt_stop_coworker_from_being/," 

Hello everyone,

I  have been newly dating someone for a few months now and his job has a 3  year internship program currently that he just started.  He has to  finish this program to get his certification ultimately. He moved to the  area about 5-6 months ago and so did his co-worker.  They both didn't  know anyone here prior to moving here and became good friends really  quickly.  I met my SO and we had an instant connection and I really  enjoy being with him.  However, recently a few weeks ago we both noticed  his co-worker being incredibly weird with me.  Long stares and just  always making an effort to be near me and finding ways to touch me.

He  is married and has a child in California that may move up here in a 10  months.  He never speaks highly of her and they are of a different  culture (Asian).  So maybe some of his behavior is cultural (input  wanted on this).  The co-worker is Vietnamese.  He married his wife and  they were both each other's firsts (hers at least) and the marriage was  somewhat arranged.  So me and my SO always joke about it and originally  found his attention on me funny.  I did too, because the guy is goofy  and playful and it was harmless....at first.  I even consider him a  friend and he has been instrumental in helping my SO and I work through a  few issues from time to time.  My SO is a sarcastic ass most of the  time and would joke about sharing me and just letting him have one  freebie as a joke. We had a few stupid jokes like this and laughed it  off and I wouldn't want to cause a fight over something like that.  They  do have to work together another 3 years and it never went beyond just  weird flirtation. Me and my SO are generally not jealous people and I  know he trusts me to not do anything with the guy.

Also  I actually think his co-worker is a genuinely a nice guy 90 percent of  the time.  But I feel like something changed beyond just temptation and a  few flirty thoughts.  This past weekend he came and watched me run a 5k  and my SO had to work, so it was just him.  He basically decided to  spend the whole day with me and I stupidly allowed it considering that I  feel like we have a friendship as well, not just my SO and him. He  kissed my forehead and grabbed my neck and played with my hair and just  went too far.  I told my SO about it right away and he again just played  if off.  I am beyond laughing about it anymore.  I don't like it and it  made me feel gross.  Even the next day all of the co-workers were over  for a football game and he grabbed a pillow and started rubbing my foot  under it.  I didn't want to make a scene for my SO's sake and all the  colleagues (a somewhat prestigious field, that ruining his reputation  could have serious consequences). I have currently just been walking up  or moving away each time something happens.  I told my SO again  everything and he is not joking about it anymore at least.  He said we  will just avoid him for awhile. But that it might be hard.  He said  maybe I need to say something and I said I would try to gracefully and  then my SO took it back and asked me not to.  IDK what to do.  It makes  me feel gross.  But I don't want to cause an  issue professionally for my SO, but I don't want to keep having to avoid  someone touching me either.

As  a side note, the co-worker touches my bf a lot as well.  He is touchy  feely with anyone in his close social circle.  But I am not justifying  it, just wondering if maybe the culture lends to more physical touch  with friends.

TL;DR:   Boyfriend doesn't mind his co-worker touching me or looking at me  weird.  They are in a 3 year program where making a scene or ruining a  friendship could be problematic.  What should I do? Is my bf responsible  for setting a boundary or am I?"
9mszna,1,2018-10-09,A friend (22m) needs more friends. How do I (22f) deal with my frustrations or help him?,ShyFossa,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9mszna/a_friend_22m_needs_more_friends_how_do_i_22f_deal/,"I am an introvert. I love my me-time. My entire school career I avoided having classmates, or even friends over unless they were my BEST friends, bc I didn't want to have my valuable time used up by people I was content seeing only at school. 

I've known this friend, Al, since I was 9 and he was 10. He and I both struggled with anxiety. We had a group of four in school, us included. After we changed schools we mostly lost touch, except for the rare phone call. He home-schooled and hasn't really made any friends since. Two years ago, he and I worked together as interns on an art project. My girlfriend, Tam, also joined as an intern, tho at the time, we were in the closet. 

This project meant we saw each other weekly, sometimes more than once a week, both on the weekends, and during weekday evenings to pull extra time to finish the project. (It was supposed to last a couple months, it lasted a year, and by the halfway point I was miserable with the project and the people, him included. If I wasn't overseeing it, nothing would get done, which happened a couple times when I got sick during a work session.) After the project finished, I was So Fucking Relieved that I could have my weekends back, and more quiet time. 

Al wanted to keep hanging out weekly. We all do art, so art nights were a fun idea, but it was too much for me. He and Tam hung out, with me joining occasionally, every third get-together or something.

Tam and I, being 'BFFs', having a cat and  business together, and being long term romantic partners, naturally saw each other quite a bit. I'd post it on my Instagram sometimes, and without fail, each time he saw we were hanging out, he'd message us saying ""it makes me sad to see u guys hanging out without me :( "" 

That fall, we went to a concert for a band we all loved, partly for fun, but they bought me a ticket as a late birthday gift, so it doubled as a birthday celebration. Several months later, for our big fancy annual date, Tam booked a stay in a ski lodge not far from home, we split the cost, and we had a beautiful evening, and an amazing day on the slopes. Later, I posted about it - I took some pics I wanted to share and didn't see the issue. 

Well, guess who was upset that we hadn't invited him bc he ""likes skiing too"" and ""even if it was for Tam's birthday, the concert was for YOUR birthday and we all went together."" (It was not for her birthday. For her birthday I took her to dinner and a hot spring.) We told him if he wanted to go skiing the three of us, we could go again, but it never happened, largely bc things came to a bit of a head in the next paragraph.

We got fed up with him wanting to be in on every single thing we did, so we finally just told him we were dating, with the condition that we were still closeted to all but a few close friends. He chilled out a little bit, like ""oh, ok. Since you're DATING I guess it makes sense you want one-on-one time."" (This annoyed me bc I felt that us dating shouldn't have been the issue, but rather his sense of entitlement to our time.) I also told him bluntly that I like my alone time, and I still had no intention of attending art nights every week. I tried to reassure him that it wasn't a reflection on him, but just a necessary measure I needed to take to preserve my own boundaries and sanity. We really hoped that this would establish some boundaries with him, and alleviate the issue.

Now, it's been about  9 months. Tam and I came out officially, bought a house, and adopted two more cats. Al got his GED last fall and is in his 2nd semester of college, which I really hoped would help him find more friends. It hasn't. He's taking all art classes, so hopes were high that he'd find some common ground with his classmates.

Tam and I are busy trying to pay a mortgage and bills, and figure out adult life. We've had relatives in the hospital, and had to help some other friends with a big move. We've been really busy, and so he hasn't been over in about a month, though we've talked via discord. 

This weekend, we did a studio tour show together. He stayed over afterwards to unpack, and kept commenting on how long it's been, to the point of excess. The next day, he told me he was purposefully trying to emphasize how Long It's Been. This isn't the first time he's made comments like this in the last few months, but this being the longest, it felt kinda justified on his part, except we've been keeping in touch and made it pretty clear we've been totally swamped. (Tam has been working overtime nonstop, and he acts like he's So Annoyed by this when I'm the one who had a girlfriend who I've gotten maybe an hour a day with for the past 3 weeks. She's been consistently getting home at 9pm or later.)

I love Al dearly. He's one of my oldest friends, but I don't have the energy or the willingness to hang out socially as often as he'd like. We are his only friends. We are probably his 'best friends', but honestly there are other people I feel much closer too, and less badgered by. I'm happy to see him now and again, and love to do shows with him, and have art night here and there, but I cannot commit to the time he wants. I won't put myself in a situation I know I will struggle to handle with grace. 

I really feel he deserves friends who will love him for who he is, all his anxiety included, and who will have more energy available to spend hanging out with him. We are his friends, but we are not the friends he needs in order to fulfill his social requirements. 

Is there a way I can say this to him, kindly, or help/encourage him to widen his social circle? I am not the most tactful person sometimes, but I don't want to hurt him, as I know that like me, he is a sensitive and anxious creature. I don't want him to feel like I don't want his friendship, but I do need him to understand that I meant it when I'm an introvert who needs a lot of space, and that his expectations of how often we'll see each other are setting all of us up for failure?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: Friend always feels he should be included in hanging out with me and my girlfriend, but I am an introvert who needs her space, and I just want to figure out how to help him make more friends or otherwise resolve the problem."
9mt2pp,2,2018-10-09,I accept the universe's verdict for me.,disposable_lover,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9mt2pp/i_accept_the_universes_verdict_for_me/,"I apologize for the long post in advance. There are several directions that I need to take this post, and I will do so to accomplish what I need to accomplish here.

I'm a 28 year old man. From an onlooker's standpoint, my life is pretty good. I am going to be entering a well-paying, meaningful medical profession in about half a year. I'm fit, athletic, good-looking, have plenty of friends, and am good with women. On the inside, though, I've been suffering for as long as I can remember. When I was a child, I developed severe OCD and depression. My parents did not get me the help I needed for 8 years, and as a result of this, I never learned what it was like to be happy and at peace. I did not have good models for healthy relationships, which will be important later. I went on antidepressants for a few years and then came off because I couldn't tolerate the side effects anymore. This was around age 20. At this time, I started having hormonal issues in the form of low testosterone. Because my levels weren't quite low enough for doctors to treat me despite the fact that I had symptoms, I went untreated for several years. After a while, I couldn't take it anymore, obtained my own supply of testosterone, and began to treat myself. My symptoms resolved, but all healthcare providers from that point on began to view me as an illicit drug user and a drug seeker. This also becomes relevant later. Around age 26 I began developing symptoms of ADHD, which had made graduate school extraordinarily difficult. However, because I didn't have symptoms as a child, I was unable to get a diagnosis and thus unable to get legal access to medication that could help me.

Until this time last year, I had been a serial monogamist. More accurately, I had had a few relationships that were committed, short, and intense, interspersed with long periods of involuntary celibacy. None of them were healthy and most were codependent and destructive. I always, always felt alone. At age 27, I had finally had enough after an extremely destructive relationship almost cost me my sanity. I vowed to improve my skills with women and I did so in the context of exploring open relationships and FWB arrangements. Within half a year, I went through about 20 partners. Some of them stuck around for a while, and one of them I had very real feelings for, although she ultimately chose someone who could offer her monogamy. My feelings of loneliness would come and go. They would be tempered by the little dopamine hits of finding a new partner, of having a satisfying sexual experience, of meeting someone else's needs.

This past summer, I began to date a woman who was 8 years older than me. She was far more successful than I was and had a child. I had never imagined myself dating a woman with a child, especially because I could never imagine myself having one, and I was intimidated by how much further along she was in her life than I was, but I loved the challenge that she brought me. This was possibly the first time that I felt stable and secure in my life. I would spend time with her and her daughter and I would experience feelings that I didn't know existed. This was the first time I had ever wanted to be a part of someone's family, to raise a child with someone, to give her more children. I cancelled the vasectomy that I had scheduled for myself. I gave this woman monogamy and I gave her the absolute best of myself. Over Labor Day weekend, I met her family. She told me she loved me. I said it back. I meant it. Then, a week later, she broke up with me because ""we were at different places in life and \[she\] really wanted to date older men."" It was completely out of the blue. I was devastated; I felt like my one opportunity for stability, for having a family, for really loving someone was ripped from me.

I went back to what I was doing and went through nearly 10 partners in a month. Some of them I actually liked and still sleep with, but I'm still hurting. Like before, my loneliness lifts for a second when I'm with them, and then it returns once they leave my apartment. I launched into the worst depressive episode that I've had since I was a teenager. The complete lack of sunlight that my region is experiencing is making things much worse (and I have not benefited from sun lamps in the past). In the past several months I have tried 7 different antidepressants, all of which have given me intolerable side effects. I feel like a human pharmaceutical garbage dump. I managed to get my hands on a supply of low dose Adderall, which has been the only thing that has helped the lethargy, inattention, and depression, but none of my healthcare providers will give it to me because of my lack of official ADHD diagnosis and my history of using testosterone without a prescription. My doctor told me that giving me what I'm asking for would put her license on the line. I told her that this is my life on the line. She told me to ""drink coffee, get more sleep, and think positive thoughts."" I don't understand how I'm supposed to survive an intense internship, rigorous schoolwork, and prepare for and pass a board exam on coffee and positive thoughts when I'm in such a mental state.

So this is where I am. I do not wish for death, but I haven't wished for life for many years. I accept the universe's verdict for me: I exist to serve some kind of purpose for some people, to be used as a comforting thing, perhaps a few women's second-to-last man, to maybe touch a few lives, to write a few poems and books, and then to be discarded and forgotten, to die alone in the arms of a bunch of women. I have known for a long time that I was going to die by my own hand. Now is not my time, but I know it's going to come. I have given myself until age 30. This gives me plenty of time to start my career, relocate, experience true independence, improve the lives of my patients, and explore other options for my happiness. If after that time things are as they are now, I see no point in continuing. I cannot bear this verdict indefinitely. I cannot live with these things crushing me with tiny breaks for air once in a while. I would never condemn another human being to a life of feeling like this, and I refuse to condemn myself. I wish I could be a ""regular"" person who is either content to be alone or is able to maintain a healthy, stable relationship. All I've ever known is how to respond to chaos with chaos. There has been no relief, no peace to be found, just little hits of dopamine and memories that torture me. I eagerly await my liberation from this, whether it comes in the form of me understanding how to live or my death.

Thank you for reading."

9mtkx6,3,2018-10-09,Could God send signs through strangers? What would this look like?,caradeee,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/9mtkx6/could_god_send_signs_through_strangers_what_would/,"I just had a really bizarre, validating experience today and I know it's a sign. I just want to get some outside perspective.  

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I didn't want to get into the story bc I knew I wouldn't be able to keep it short, but you asked for it - 

So backstory: I've had a rough life, but things are finally turning around and I've been able to understand what my true purpose is here on Earth, even though I still question it, I continue to work towards it. I recognize that everything happens for a reason and use my obstacles as opportunities for growth. In the past year, my desire to get in touch with my spirituality has gone into overdrive. I've gradually been praying more. I've been living with Him and His plan in mind. My faith in Him has been growing rapidly, but it has been like I've been growing spiritually in secret. I wanted to take my faith a step further and start to do more with it, but I had not been able to figure out how.  

Over the past month, it seems like my opportunities for personal and spiritual growth have been *everywhere.* I began an internship where I conveniently work directly with a minister. The first time we really talked he was able to bring all my spiritual interests together in a way that made me realize that God is involved in everything. It all connects. I can't really explain what he made me realize, but just know that I was fucking mindblower for a few hours after that. Yesterday, I talked to him about going to confession for the first time in years where he told me I was able to confess to him when I wanted to if I felt comfortable. He explained to me how I can start getting into the bible. He also brought up the exact bible verse that I have been thinking about getting tattooed on me for the past year. He's not the sign I'm talking about, though, I just want you to understand that everything has been aligning. I just think that it is funny that I wanted some guidance to get closer to God and my officemate is a minister.  

Today, I was representing my organization at an event at a university where I tried to give students passing by informational brochures, free t-shirts, pens, sunglasses, etc. I work for a mental health organization, so students were hesitant to approach my table, so I got pretty comfortable yelling, ""WANT FREE STUFF?!"" at anyone walking by who even glanced at my table slightly. It was about 10 minutes before my shift there was over and I was thinking about packing up early until a girl who looked around my age (22) gently smiled at me while walking by, so I asked her the golden question. She approached the table and asked, ""What's this for?"" and then before waiting for me to respond said, ""I love your bracelets!"" I have two red stringed bracelets on my right arm. One of which has the healing crystal, Tiger's Eye, stitched in. The other has Rose Quartz. ""Aw thank you. Do you know what healing crystals are?"" She grabbed her necklace. A single Tiger's Eye crystal.  

I don't remember exactly how the conversation went from there, but we immediately began talking about all of the ""unique"" interests that we both shared. I had never met someone before that seemed to be as interested in all of it s I was. ""Would you say you're spiritual?"" She asked. ""Yes, definitely."" I responded. She started telling me about how she wants to start an organization or a company that does nothing but educate people about spirituality where she would try to help people to open their eyes, wake up, and transcend. Now, I thought I was familiar with spiritual concepts and theories and all that. But in the next 10 minutes, she started throwing around phrases and theories that I don't remember ever hearing in my life. Instead of confusing me, as conversation topics I'm unfamiliar with usually would, I grew overcome with the urgent desire to go home and start researching all of it right then and there. She mentioned that she was an empath and then comments, ""You are too, right?"" I'm more of a lightworker, but I am still very much an empath. I started to feel like I was literally talking to another version of me, one that was 10 steps ahead in their spiritual growth. I had never connected so purely and organically with someone like this before. I had met her 5 minutes ago. I don't even know her name. I knew she was changing my life with every word she said. I felt in my core that she had to symbolize something in my life. 

Just to glaze over some of the concepts she brought up: She started by bringing up consciousness. Then mentioned mother earth. Then something about ascending. She brought up our souls and told me that we'd be going to a different universe after this life, just like we had done before. She pinched her thumb and her pointer finger together and said, ""We all start from practically nothing. And then we live. And we develop one lens on top of another on top of the next determining how we see reality. The more life we live, the harder it is to see things without influence or from a clear perspective like we did during our first days."" I mentioned that I have always been so attracted to the unknown, taboo, and spiritual, but was always made fun of when I would try to share what I've learned with others. She said her too. She said we're different and it's a good thing, ""That's why we struggle so much to connect with others. Our minds are just in such different places, we don't know how to bring ourselves down to their form of thought. They just don't get it. We have different values. We have different needs. They don't help our growth, so we fail to find reasons to keep them in our lives. Thats why we don't have very many friends."" With that, she put into words my entire ongoing struggle with maintaining relationships. I always just thought I was a bad friend. My mind was more blown.  

She told me that the past and the future are just concepts. They're not real. This hit me in regards to my difficulties letting go of the shit I've been through that's acted as an obstacle to functioning every single day. The asserted that absolutely nothing is as it seems and that it is important for us to keep working to take away those lenses, follow our attraction to the divine so we can transcend and see clearly. She asked me if I had my breakthrough yet. ""What?"" Was my response. ""So no... You'll get there. You're getting so close and I'm so proud of you. Once it happens, everything will make sense to you. You won't have to live your life through the conflict between your intuition and your mind anymore. You'll know you can trust it. You'll know what's truth. No more doubting who you were meant to be. Everything else will follow after that and you can return to peace."" This is what fucked me up. My mental-intuitive inner conflict has been the biggest obstacle of my life since I was about 14. I couldn't figure out what made her know that I was dealing with this in my head 24/7 OR that I don't trust my perception of reality so I overanalyze it to death. I feel like I'm not capable of being at peace with myself because of these things. These were some of the biggest overarching issues of my entire life and she called them out. Since I began talking to her, I felt this overwhelming energy that I can't even explain. This just felt different. It felt important.

She had me write down my name and number so we could keep in touch and then told me about spiritual conferences coming up that I had never heard of before and wrote down the names of them for me. I asked for her number but she said her phone was broken. I asked if she had a Facebook and she said no. Okay, whatever, she has my number. I told her how grateful I felt that we had crossed paths and that she had validated some things I have been dealing with intensely throughout the last month. I joked that she was a sign from God telling me I'm on the right path. She smiled and commented on how special moments in life like this are. She then told me that her husband was waiting for her outside to bring her to work, so there she went.  

Sorry for the novel, I just want you guys to understand why this has touched me so much. I really think she was a sign from God confirming that I'm on the right path. I've been praying a lot more lately, not always even asking for things, just saying thank you, so I almost feel like he's acknowledging my efforts and telling me to keep going. I just wanted to see what you guys thought because you have better religious/biblical insight than I do and I guess I want to prove to myself that I'm not just making something out of nothing. "

The company is apparently an energy startup which uses artificial intelligence to help consumers track more effectively their spending on energy. Think a suped-up Smart Meter. There is nothing wrong with that company proposition. But oh my lord, the job specification is something out of my worst nightmares.Here are some of the highlights:

* The first paragraph states they want to be the Uber or Monzo of the Energy market. 


* They change font and font size after the first paragraph of the posting.


* The pronoun shifts from first person plural (we are looking for...) to third personal plural (they are hiring...) randomly and consistently. Capitalisation is random. The writer seems to have a love-hate relationship with the full stop and doesn't always use them to end a sentence or a bullet point.  


* ""you become our Ninjas""


* No clear job specification despite being a job specification. I *think* they are hiring people to act as customer support, but on £30k a year starting salary I do not know why they would pay that much, though the next bullet point gives a potential answer...


* ""Stamina – changing the world, does not happen from 9-5pm, so let’s order pizzas for the team and make it happen"". Not only do I spot two serious errors and three copy mistakes in this one sentence, but they explicitly are saying they will make you work well beyond office hours without mentioning extra pay.


* No clear statement of what your job title actually is.


* They want people with 'good computer skills'. By computer skills, they mean ""office, web, etc."" 


* They have three different career tracks: Analytics; Operations; and Communications-slash-marketing-slash-social. It is not highlighted how any of these things are different.


* Despite being a startup, they have planned for a year-plus graduate programme and already know what the typical career trajectory is for people who have worked in their company - ""Usual examples of next steps in the graduate program are marketing associate, social media community manager, data-science analyst, operations associate, etc.""


(I will add more if anything else offends me reading this job listing again)

I have put more effort into this reddit post than this company has put into their job posting advert. I am genuinely disgusted by this job advertisement. If I knew who the client of Inspiring Interns was, I would get in touch to let them know how their money is being wasted by this illiterate company. 


P.S. I have a guess that it is &gt;!Verv Energy!&lt;, if anyone has more knowledge of the UK energy market than I do, I'd be grateful for your thoughts"

9mu126,3,2018-10-09,relationship vs. career,TheAbLord,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9mu126/relationship_vs_career/,"The eternal question, it seems like, for people in my age range. I'm 23, graduating college soon with a degree in Computer Science, looking to start my full-time career at a software company. I've been seeing my girlfriend for over a year, and while we have spent a good deal of time together in that year, most of our relationship has been long distance-the longest amount of time we've spent in the same place at once is 3 months. This is due to the fact that we both live on opposite sides of the US.

At the moment, I'm looking at a job that would take me to a city near her. This city is one I'd really enjoy living in and is honestly well suited to people my age in terms of activities- I worked there over the summer as an intern (the 3 months we spent together), and it was a blast.

The job, on the other hand, is one I'm not super crazy about. It's not bad by any means, and I would most accurately describe it as ""just decent."" I already know that my coworkers and boss are really friendly and would love to have me back, and they've given me a pretty good offer. However, I know that I'm mostly considering going back because I could finally close the gap with my girlfriend. Not gonna lie, if I was single I would probably look at other companies/locations.

Lately I've been having second thoughts about taking the job- I'm worried I may regret compromising part of my career to be with my girlfriend. On the other hand, I know I may resent myself if I end the relationship because I want a better career. Out of all the girls I've ever dated, I've never felt so compatible with her. The year we've spent together is the happiest of my life, to the point where I constantly envision us as having a future together. I've dated a lot of girls, and never felt this way about any of them before. And some people will call this infatuation, but I just ask that you trust me to know my feelings here- this relationship is one of the best things to ever happen to me.

***So with all that being said, I ask of you, reddit***: Should I prioritize my career in software, or should I appeal to my human side and compromise slightly to be with my significant other? I've always been kind of a free-spirit, and a strong proponent of living life first, career second. At the same time, this view complicates as you get older and see all the benefits a strong career can bring. What do you think?"

It is probably the most severe symptom I have and the one that has caused me the most pain. This pain led me to successfully manage my anxiety, through working out, meditation, medication, having a close knit group of friends, family, and eating better. I had realized I would always have issues with anxiety, but because of how manageable it had become I was able to live a normal life and for once, feel like I was living in the moment.

Then I got an internship. At first it was fun, I loved how fast-paced it was, but my brain couldn't keep up with my body. I started to feel more and more irritated and now that feeling is absolutely overwhelming me. I have a panic attack every morning before work and almost every commute home. I took a week off to get back in shape, but today was my first day back and I am coming down from a horrible anxiety attack as I type this, with horrible irritability that made me very aggressive to my close friends. The internship is ending in a couple of weeks and my psychiatrist is adjusting my meds, but does anyone have any different advice? Mainly looking for ways to not go completely crazy before it is over. "

You don't really care what I'm here to talk to you about. You're more interested in what I'm prepared to give you. That's the nature of politics. Even for causes you believe in passionately, you don't give your vote away for free. There's always going to be something in it for you.

The past year has seen amazing things happen. The #metoo movement brought down men at the highest levels of politics, journalism, business and entertainment. For a while, it seemed like men were beaten, that the days of groping an intern or bending a secretary over the desk were gone. Now, the tide has turned. Men will no longer be afraid to take what they deserve. Women will not be allowed to tease with impunity, hiding behind fear of #metoo.

I have long, silky black hair, a pretty face, with those narrow, slanted eyes and a tiny mouth with plump lips. I am 4'11"", and I weigh 90#. I was wearing 4"" stilettos that did amazing things for my legs, and the skirt of my suit was short enough to give you ideas. The jacket was buttoned, and fit my figure enough for you to know I had a surprisingly full chest for such a tiny girl.

##First Phase

###Section 1: Job Creation

&gt;Brazil now has 169 million people of working age. To generate employment and occupation in a sustainable way for this formidable mass of Brazilians, our country needs to adopt a planned strategy, a national plan debated by society as a whole, establishing social and economic priorities. Short, medium and long term goals that allow Brazil to achieve, in terms of income and human development, the same level of some European or Asian countries that have already left behind such problems as unemployment, poverty and poverty and offer opportunities and a good level of life for all its inhabitants. 

&gt;Brazil has the conditions, wealth and resources to do so. But this requires a plan, a path established between society and government, between workers, the private sector and the public sector, which clearly defines development policies focused on expanding the competitiveness of the productive sectors, especially the transformation and redoubled attention to the export sector, also considering the strength of our agribusiness and mining, which generate essential foreign exchange for the country's external accounts. We need to create jobs for millions of Brazilians and Brazilians. This is one of the most important goals of our program. To achieve these goals, the country needs to resume growth and a series of economic measures will be needed; all of them aim at increasing investments that will increase productive capacity, making possible the creation of the much needed new jobs.

##The following directives will be applied by government as a part of the Project;

**1.1)** The achievement of fiscal balance so that the government regains its capacity to invest and carry out social policies to improve the living conditions of the population. In other words, we will ensure the fiscal and social security sustainability of the State in all its spheres and promote the simplification of the tax system, raising the investment capacity of governments and enabling the provision of quality public services for the whole of society. We set the goal of achieving balance in the primary outcome in two years of government, and in order to achieve this balance, a series of reforms will be necessary:

**Tax, tributary and social security reform**

* Implementation of a capitalized multipillar social security system, in which the first pillar, financed by the Treasury, would be dedicated to assistance policies; the second pillar would correspond to a social security regime with parameters adjusted in relation to the current situation; and the third pillar would amount to a capitalization scheme in individual accounts. In addition, it would be discussed the introduction of minimum ages differentiated by activity and gender;

* Initial reduction of 15% of tax concessions;

* Review all government expenditures so as to eliminate waste, overlap and privilege; spending on investments, health and education should be preserved;

* Review all government expenditures so as to eliminate waste, overlap and privilege; spending on investments, health and education should be preserved;

* Exemption of taxes on the acquisition of capital goods;

* Reduction of Income Tax of the legal entity;

* Reduction of taxes on consumption (PIS / COFINS and ICMS);

* Creation of a Value Added Tax (VAT), unifying various taxes currently available;

* Gradual elimination of so-called pejotization;

* Reconstruction of income tax on profits and dividends;

* Alteration of ITCD rates (inheritance and gift tax);

* Simplification of the import tariff structure;

* Increase in the ITCD tax rate (inheritance and gift tax);

* Repeal of EC 95 (Expenditure Ceiling Amendment), to be replaced by another mechanism that controls the evolution of the overall expenses of the government, preserving, as stated above, spending on investments, Health and Education;

* Reduction of bureaucracy for opening, monitoring of tax operations and closure of companies.

**Budget reform**

* Greater integration between planning of government objectives, their goals, budget and a results-oriented management model;

* Introduction of the multi-annual budget for major priority projects;

* Creation of the priority projects unit, with monitoring and evaluation system;

* Schedule of disbursements associated with the evaluation of the execution of projects and results achieved;

* Creation of incentives for saving budgetary resources;

* Improvement of the bidding process;

* Greater transparency in budget classification and execution;

* Creation of monitoring system and apportionment of costs.

**Reform of public management**

* Implementation of a dynamic long-term planning process, with a 20-year horizon, in which every four years planning would be updated for the next two decades, serving as a basis for the preparation of multi-year plans;

* Redefinition of ministries according to the duties to be performed by the government;

* Improvement of integration among the various organizational structures with a view to magnifying the intersectorial and transversal effects of public policies;

* Carrying out workforce planning that aligns staffing needs to the strategic functions and objectives of government;

* Alignment of personnel policy with workforce planning results;

* Professional development of the server board and the structure of incentives based on the achievement of results;

* Creation of realistic incentive mechanisms and performance evaluation;

* Introduction of a meritocratic system for occupying positions in commission;

* Creation of instruments and parameters for the monitoring and evaluation of public policy;

* Implementation of a system of targets and monitoring of results associated to the budget;

* Improvement and strengthening of fiscal management mechanisms and cost control;

* Creation of mechanisms to identify innovative projects that can be disseminated in public administration;

* Integration and modernization of public Information and Communication Technology systems (TIC) and implementation of Big Data systems in the Federal Government;

* Improvement and expansion of so-called e-government, greatly increasing the provision of services, controls carried out electronically and the debureaucratization of work processes;

* Improvement of the federative agreement and of the public consortium rules for the execution of public policies;

* Stimulus to the provision of public services, which are not exclusive to non-state public organizations such as social organizations;

* Review of the regulatory agencies' performance;

* Improvement of the legal framework governing public administration,
including the purchasing process.

**1.2)** The reduction of the interest rate, to stimulate the resumption of investments
depriving the population and businesses, is essential. To achieve this objective, a monetary reform must be carried out accompanied by a set of measures that will reduce both the basic interest rate defined by the Central Bank and that charged to consumer and corporate financing:

* Commitment to the reduction of the basic interest rate (Selic) in line with the fiscal adjustment;

* Reduction of indexation in the financial market through the gradual replacement of Treasury bills, adjusted by the Selic, for fixed-rate bonds in debt financing;

* The gradual replacement of repurchase operations (overnight operations with ballast in public bonds with a repurchase commitment by the Central Bank) for remunerated voluntary deposits (which are not backed by government securities) with the Central Bank;

* Bank deregulation to enable the greater offer of financial services by small and medium-sized institutions and expand the banking network;

* Improvement of legislation in order to facilitate the operation of new financial businesses inside and outside the banking system, including regulation and encouragement of the development of financial institutions operating exclusively through the Internet, called Fintechs;

* Greater control of banking concentration by regulators; CADE's participation with the Central Bank in this process;

* Active participation of Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econômica Federal in the process of reducing bank spread, guaranteeing the necessary profitability of its operations.

**1.3)** The defense of a competitive exchange rate is essential, together with a series of other measures, to recover the capacity of Brazilian companies, producers of industrialized goods and sophisticated services, to compete in the foreign market. It is also fundamental to prevent importing companies from bringing artificially low prices in Brazilian reais that make it impossible for Brazilian companies to compete with them, resulting in the elimination of many jobs in the country:

* The exchange rate should fluctuate, with reduced volatility, around a competition for the domestic industry;

* The balanced fiscal policy and the reduction of the interest rate will be the determinants of this behavior of the exchange rate;

* Reconstruction of the sovereign fund, to prevent excessive exchange rate fluctuations due to commodity cycles, enable the implementation of countercyclical policies and the stability of important prices, such as oil, in the domestic market (always safeguarding the profitability of assets).

**1.4)** Maintaining inflation at low levels is fundamental for the
and this is another essential point of our program. We want to combine the lowest possible inflation with the goal of creating the necessary jobs for the Brazilian population. Therefore, the inflation targeting regime will be maintained, and the Central Bank will pursue the lowest possible rate of inflation associated with an unemployment rate that does not sacrifice the Brazilian population:

* The Central Bank will have two primary goals: the rate of inflation and the unemployment rate, as it is in the United States of America;

* Adoption of core measures of price indices as inflation target;

* Change of the convergence period from inflation to the target in case of inflationary shocks (instead of the calendar year, adopt a greater number of months);

* Disindexing relevant prices of the economy;

* Extension of the composition of the National Monetary Council;

* Dissemination of the transcription of the recordings of the Copom meetings after six months, aiming for greater transparency of the actions of the Central Bank.

**1.5)** Industrial policy, along with other instruments such as science and technology and credit policy, has always assisted in the development of sectors considered strategic, whether for the generation of innovations or jobs (or both), in both developed and developing countries. It should be designed in a complementary way to macroeconomic policy, not to compensate for imbalances, as it was in the recent past:

* Definition of four major priority complexes. The choice of these complexes is due to the following factors:

    * its impact on the trade balance, through the high participation of imported inputs in its production process;

    * its positive impact on the production of other sectors;

    * the possibility of better utilization, with added value, of our natural resources;

    * the generation of technology that could be disseminated to other sectors of the economy. They are agribusiness, defense, the oil, gas and biofuels sector and the production of goods to serve the health services.

* The fifth relevant sector, civil construction, a strong generator of jobs, will be stimulated by the policy oriented towards the recovery of infrastructure, including basic sanitation and housing;

* Policies to encourage innovation and sustainability financed by the BNDES and private banks, primarily aimed at increasing competitiveness and raising exports with greater technological content and diversification, and encouraging complementary investments in the production chain, especially in the integration of industry and modern services, so as to enable us to participate in the most relevant stages of global value chains;

* Definition of the BNDES as a major financial agent of the industrial policy strategy, together with FINEP and state innovation promotion agencies;

* Reinforcement of the policy of preference for local inputs in government procurement processes;

* Improvement of the local content policy, aiming at its simplification and, at the same time, its adoption as an effective instrument to stimulate the national producer;

* Link with science and technology policy through the creation of stimuli to the joint action of universities, companies and research institute in the development of products and technologies.

**1.6)** A policy of international insertion that promotes the productive sector, with a special focus on the high-tech manufacturing industry and for knowledge-intensive services, is fundamental to ensure that globalization generates quality jobs, rather than destroying the few remaining jobs in these sectors . To do so, there needs to be a strategy focused on the long term, with strong support for the exports of these products and services. Brazil is able to approach, in terms of income and human development, the European countries, as long as it clearly establishes policies focused on expanding the external competitiveness of the most technologically sophisticated productive sectors:

* Definition of clear growth targets for manufactured exports;

* Prioritization in the concession of credit, by the BNDES, to companies that fulfill export goals, innovation, increase of competitiveness and generation of jobs; practice of lower interest rates for those that innovate and preserve the environment;

* Development of mechanisms to facilitate the access of exporters to financing with costs compatible with those obtained by their external competitors;

* Improvement of infrastructure for production outflow;

* Rationalization of the import tariff structure;

* Establishment of trade agreements, preserving the interests of the country;

* Structuring of support to Brazilian companies in the prospection of markets and in customer service abroad.

**1.7)** All policies aimed at growth and job creation lack the resources to be made viable. A credit policy, which resumes the capacity to finance companies and the population at large, will be fundamental in our development strategy. A series of measures will be adopted to recover the volume of credit in the Brazilian economy. The reduction of interest rates and repurchase operations will lead the financial system to carry out loan operations and the volume of credit supply is expected to grow:

* Definition of a set of actions to help reduce the indebtedness of families and companies;

* Changes in the current policy of compulsory deposits on bank deposits;

* Stimulus to the dissemination of the positive register;

* Popularization of the market of funds backed by private titles;

* Encouraging the development of the capital market and long-term private financing, which will also contribute to the increase of national savings;

* Development of alternative credit mechanisms, such as venture capital;

* Definition of a tax structure that stimulates the granting of long-term credit;

* Resumption of the BNDES 'role in granting investment, research and innovation credit through the creation of new forms of fundraising;

* Reinforcement of the role of Caixa Econômica Federal (CEF) in the financing of social policies;

* Strengthening BB's role in granting credit to agriculture and working capital to small and medium-sized enterprises.

**1.8)** In addition, specific policies for the direct creation of jobs, complementary to all of these mentioned above, will be necessary, given the high unemployment of the Brazilian economy. In June 2018, this contingent reached 13 million people, almost double the number registered in 2014; so that in order to recover the employment of millions of Brazilians quickly and create jobs for other people entering the labor market, we will propose a set of emergency and other actions that will help promote the sustainable generation of jobs, giving priority to the vulnerable groups of the population, stimulating formalization in the labor market and professional training compatible with the demands of public and private organizations, also improving the policies of productive inclusion:

* Creation of an emergency employment program, with emphasis in the areas of sanitation and civil construction, in line with the policies to stimulate these areas, as proposed in these guidelines for the government program;

* Creation of training programs in the unemployment pockets of large cities, such as the support of Sistema S and federal educational institutions;

* Establishment of a policy of ""adoption, improvement and multiplication"" of existing ""informal"" day-care centers to enable mothers of infants to enter the labor market;

* Policies to provide cheap and cheap credit for retirement and expansion of housing for low-income families, which will improve their living conditions and simultaneously contribute to the re-establishment of the labor market in construction;

* Offering short-term courses aimed at Nem-Nems (young people aged 15-29 who neither study nor work; 23% of young people in this age group were in this situation in 2017). The policies in relation to this group will be more detailed later in these guidelines for the government program, but it is emphasized that one of its components will be the creation of training courses to facilitate their insertion in the job market;

* Review current labor laws to adapt them to new labor market trends, leverage entrepreneurship, encourage firms and workers to enter into longer employment contracts, stimulate productivity gains and reduce legal uncertainty;

* Improving monitoring and evaluation systems to determine training needs and to better target the expansion of vocational training programs, including in the direction of new jobs that will be demanded in the future, as well as the expansion of partnerships with the private sector to verify the areas that more need training, facilitating students' access to internships and work placements;

* Reform of services such as the National Employment System (SINE), improving its structure and its capacity for articulation with the productive sector.

**1.9)** No less relevant, the sectors of agribusiness, family agriculture, services in general, commerce, the creative economy and tourism will also be stimulated to contribute to the growth of the Brazilian economy and the generation of jobs. In the same way, special attention should be directed to entrepreneurs, innovators and small and medium-sized enterprises. These stimuli will be discussed throughout the campaign.

9mvnks,1,2018-10-09,A question about career/job market.,RufinTheFury,cad,https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/9mvnks/a_question_about_careerjob_market/,"I'm fresh out of college and currently working as a mechanical draftsman for a great company. You might remember my shitty Revit models I posted on here before, which is the program I am most at home with and use the most at work. I'm also decent at AutoCAD and moderately skilled with CATIA, Rhino, NX, and Inventor. I really like the people and the office climate and I enjoy my work.

But due to mental health reasons I'm extremely doubtful of my ability to continue at this job. I'm super scared of quitting this job and then never finding another job in this field. The job I'm currently at is the only one that gave me an offer in college and I never had an internship. This will be my only experience in the field. 

This is the only thing I've ever trained for and been good at, been doing CAD since I was a freshman in high school and graduated with a degree for this specific work. If I can't find another job in this field I don't know what the fuck I'll do beyond go back to working crappy retail jobs. I'm not an engineer so I'm not valuable in that department, I'm just a drawer.

So what do you think? Is it even safe for me to quit out, or should I just suck it up best I can because the odds of me finding another job are low?"

9mwc9s,25,2018-10-10,Toronto compositor feeling down (No job for 5 months!),theoneintrouble,vfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/vfx/comments/9mwc9s/toronto_compositor_feeling_down_no_job_for_5/,"Hey people,

I  posted a thread earlier explaining my problem in depth and how I am not  sure if I should go for lighting or comp. I still did not entirely  figure this out.

A quick review, I am in  my mid 20s and spend most of my career in and out of Canada on Comp and  Lighting. I have a open work permit in Canada starting a few months ago.  Back home I worked on different things basically touching up everything  from modeling/lighting to some fluid sim and comp. In Canada, I worked a  short period as a 3d modeller and nearly a year of part-time as a  junior compositor. I lost my comp job couple of months ago for some  reason and have been looking for jobs ever since.

I  was really hopeless for sometime but then started to improve my demo  reel slowly. I also got a full-time low pay job just to have things  going however I am tired of this situation and need to make a move as  soon as possible.

I  have some idea to improve my reel. I am thinking of focusing on Roto  paint rather than working on different things. The demoreel on this  thread inspired me a lot [https://www.reddit.com/r/vfx/comments/9jzsq6/has\_anyone\_else\_felt\_a\_general\_slowdown\_in\_jobs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vfx/comments/9jzsq6/has_anyone_else_felt_a_general_slowdown_in_jobs/)

However,  looking desperately for jobs, I realized VFX industry is not okay. Lots  of things are being outsourced to India which makes you unable to land a  junior job or even an unpaid internship which I am totally fine with!  Speaking to a friend of mine in civil engineering the other day, I  realized there are more related stable jobs out there not only in  Architectural Visualization but also in something called BIM (Building  information modeling) which basically is visualization of the entire  construction/maintenance, etc which indeed is a cool subject and  directly linked to high budget industries therefore it seems like a much  more stable career option. Their pay is better too and there is more  chance to entrepreneurship and having your own gig rather than something  similar in VFX which is really difficult and risky.

Furthermore,  this VR/AR stuff might be a great thing to focus on for the years  coming. I am really thinking long-term here. I am wondering how you guys  see VFX in next decade or 5 years. Based on my experience jobs in VFX  are though. Animation is better but not much better. Overall the wages  are mostly shit unless you are extremely good and there is not much  stability. I worked for a large studio in Toronto (short period) but  they are not willing to give any shot for my demo reel and the  recruiters do not give a damn about it. When I search on Google jobs or  indeed for compositing/compositor/vray/lighting words not too many jobs  pop up and I know for a fact that there are some people in the same city  I live that are applying as well (including but not limited to my  friend who is a compositor for over 5 years and now is unemployed too!)

Given my experience how do you think I can land a career asap. I am really  exhausted of trying and not getting any results. I am not lazy I tell  you. I just need certainty to plan for a an achievable realstic goal.  Anyone could say my reel looks like shit and that's okay I never said I  am the best or something but I know my reel is not the only reason I am  not getting jobs.

Please also advise me how can I find compositing/lighting jobs in advertising companies.

Thanks indeed to all of you beautiful people here for making this community!  


Update: Deleted the link to my reel. Thanks for all the feedback!"

""Mister Stark?"" A voice called out across the front of the school as Tony was just about ready to get inside the car. Tony paused and looked over to Happy, raising an eyebrow casually.

**""Who's that?""**

""A girl, boss.""

**“Girl boss like that thing on Facebook?”**

“No boss, a girl.”

**""A cute girl?""**

""A school girl, Tony.""

**""Oh!""** Tony got up and out of the car, turning to face the voice and pleasantly surprised to see RiRi Williams there with a folder full of books tucked under her arm and looking at him. Straightening himself out, Tony offered her a warm smile and extended a hand for her to shake.

**""Miss Williams, hello again!""**

""You remember me?"" She asked, somewhat surprised that a man of his stature would even recognise her, let alone remember her name.

**""It's part of... Well, just how I work you know? Never forget a face and name to go with it.""**

""Oh... Well, I wanted to say thanks for this."" Riri said, offering him a look at the big yellow rosette to show off first place in the science fair. ""It means a whole lot, so... You know, thanks.""

**""Well, you're welcome. I thought your stuff was worlds ahead of the stuff on display in there. Really, it all looked really good. Gave me a whole lot to think about too.""** He said with a smile, playfully punching her on the shoulder and resting against the side of his limo. A few moments passed before he realised that the younger, dark skinned woman wasn't saying anything. **""Was there something else? A selfie or something for Twitter?""**

""Oh, no thank you. I... God, this is so embarrassing... I was hoping to get an internship at Stark Enterprises this summer. I can't stand another night at home while my dad's out at work. Is there any way you can put a good word in for me?""

That was a new one for Tony. He paused for a moment and looked over to Happy who simply smiled and shrugged his shoulders.

**""I mean... I am the boss. I can do whatever I want!""** Tony reasoned with himself out loud before looking over to her. **""Sure, do you have contact information or something? Have you already applied for the summer programme?""**

""I've already applied, you should be able to find my data in your system pretty easily."" She explained, a smile gradually getting broader and broader on her face.

**""Okay, no problem. I'll get in touch with my assistant and see if we can bump you to the front of the line.""** Tony said, a smile on his face. **""I look forward to seeing you again this summer!""**

""Thank you so much Mister Stark!"" RiRi seemingly bounced her way back up to the school before she paused and turned to look back to him. ""I guess I'll see you around, Iron Man...""

And with that, she was gone and both Tony and Happy were left struck by what she had said. Tony got into the back of the car and he was left thinking about what she had said. Did she really know he was Iron Man? If she did, how did she? It was probably one of those fan blog things that were littered all over high schools and colleges. Also some offices as well but Tony didn't really think on those ones so much. 

A couple of moments passed before Happy broke the silence.

""Look boss, you were talking about going public a couple of weeks ago. Why don't you do it."" Tony looked into the rear view mirror and looked to his bodyguard who simply continued going as he focused on the traffic in front of them. ""You've been talking about taking Stane out of the picture too, if you go public and show that you're using Stark Technology for good rather than selling missiles and guns and stuff right? If they know that you were responsible for stopping Ultron and saving so many lives then it could be a big boost of good will to the company. Same with all this clean energy product you're putting out. Might as well go whole hog right?""

Again, Happy made a lot of sense and Tony could only nod in agreement. Drumming his fingers against the side of the car, Tony looked down to his phone and unlocked it by pressing his thumb to the bottom of the screen. A beeping noise came from the phone and the screen quickly unlocked to show off the display. Scrolling through to the contacts screen of his phone, Tony rolled the list of numbers down until he settled on the number of his new assistant. Hitting the big green call button, Tony sat back in the car and studied the New York City skyline as the sound of the dial tone filled his ear.

""This is Stark Enterprises, you're talking to Miss Potts, how can I direct you call?""

**""Virginia? It's Tony.""**

""Mister Stark! How can I assist you?""

""It's Tony."" The Iron Man tried to clarify before speaking again. **""Listen, can you call a press conference for tonight? I've got something new I want to release to the public and want all eyes on me.""**

""Of course Mister Stark. You have a free diary from seven o'clock onwards, would you like me to schedule it for seven tonight?""

**""Yes please Miss Potts, seven pm at the conference room in Stark Tower.""**

""Very good Mister Stark, was there anything else?"" 

**""You not calling me Mister Stark?""**

""Not going to happen. Have a pleasant day sir."" Tony heard the dial tone again and the man could only smirk at the woman. He had heard her be called Pepper by some of the other board members before on account of how spicy she was and Tony found himself actually agreeing in regards to the term.

**""She really is-""** Tony didn't even have a chance to finish the statement as the car they were in was rocked with a massive shockwave and the car was flipped up off of the ground and into the air. The vehicle spun nearly six times in the air before it hit against a light post and came to a stop, spinning in a half circle and eventually ending with a series of creaks and groans. Shaking his head to try and free the cobwebs up and get himself ready to deal whatever it was, the side of his car was ripped clean off and thrown away so he was on display to another man in a metal suit.

""There you are."" Came the synthetic voice and Tony knew that it was going to be another pain in his ass. Tony bit down on his bottom lip as he felt at least one rib broken. ""I'm going to finish the job that the other one couldn't. The Iron Monger can claim the empire and I'm going to be his most loyal Guardsman."" The voice offered a handy bit of his plan, looking at Tony and letting him know that while he should have been in the ER, he was going to be given a world of pain.

As the two moved to grab at him, Tony hammered his smart watch and a short series of beeps rang out in the car. Looking down at it, there was a countdown of thirty seconds before the newest suit would be there for him. Looking at two power suited opponents, thirty seconds may as well have been one hundred years... The metal hand grasped at his shirt and lifted him up out of the car, hoisting him right out of the car and across the road, his body hit the nearest wall with a sickening thud and he hit the floor with a blow that took his breath away. His hands came down and grabbed at the floor, pulling himself forward even as bruised as he was, Tony had to hold out for just a little bit longer. 

Looking at his wrist, Tony grunted in pain as he realised he still had another fifteen seconds to go. Leaning back against the wall, Tony could definitely feel like there was more than a fair share of broken bones in his guts. The Iron Man watched the new figure make his way towards him and as he prepared for another attack, he closed his eyes and braced but was pleasantly surprised to hear a burst of energy crackle through the air. Opening his eyes, Tony could see that Happy had appeared and he had a hand held blaster that mimicked the Iron Man's hand repulsors. Happy fired another couple of rounds and made the blue and orange suited Iron Man suit turn to take care of Happy.

""The bodyguard..."" The voice uttered, Happy ignored it and kept firing until the battery cell was nearly empty. As it ran out, Tony looked at his wrist and he was mouthing along with the countdown.

Five...

Four...

Three...

Two...

One...

The sound of a supersonic jet filled the heavy industrial area of New York and the red and gold pod landed directly in front of him. Looking up at it, Tony winced and started to crawl forward, two arm sockets had opened on the side of it and were ready to be filled and unlocking the suit for him to use. Hopefully, the medicinal probes were ready to patch him up as well. With the suit now in front of him and the two heavy arm sockets connecting to Tony's body, the billionaire moved forward and the small rocket that contained the suit opened up and the entire yellow and red pieces of metal attached to the small markings on Tony's suit and it all started to come together and Tony could already hear the AI inside of his head connecting to him and initiating the Iron Man suit to boot up and take over some of the pressure.

""Multiple fractures detected, Sir.""

**""Yes, thank you. Work on putting some sort of painkiller into me and patch me up.""** Tony said, the helmet of his suit rolling down and locking into place. The eyes of the suit flashed with a bright blue and there was a gentle hiss that showed that the suit was fully locked up and loaded and ready to go. The small arc reactor on his chest hummed to life and the suit became fully active and now, Tony Stark was ready to kick ass.

The blue suited opponent was ready to take Happy down but the Iron Man was ready to intervene. The jets on his boots came to life and he pushed himself through the air, sailing over the roads and then his fist came forward with an added source of boost coming from the jump. Sailing through the air, Tony brought his fist down and cracked the opponent in the jaw. Sending the new suit backwards, Tony could see that the armour had a series of white text over the breastplate that stated that the suit was called Force and looked almost like it was something out of a space movie.

The blue suit, Force, took a step backwards from the punch and he seemed to shake off the hit before he turned to face the Iron Man. Force then moved in a pattern similar to what Tony had done and as his foot repulsors took off, Force sailed over Tony and then pushed his right foot forward and kicked Tony right in the face. Force landed in front of Tony and then pushed his two hands forward and his palms landed on Tony's chest and an almighty shock rocked the chest piece and made Tony's entire body shake up and down. His ribs were still definitely broken and he felt like he was on the wrong side of a hangover. Looking down at his chest, the suit was still in place and the suit's HUD let him know that his armour was still holding together. Taking a couple of steps backwards, Tony pushed the suit into the air and then pushed his own hands forward, his fingers extended and the two domes in the palm of his suits hands flashed to life with a bright, luminescent yellow and then two combined photon blasts ripped through the air and hit Force with both of the blasts aimed at Force and he wanted nothing more than to end him there and then.

Stopping the assault, Tony looked down at the body of the suit and saw that he hadn't even taken any sort of damage from the attack and was actually covered in a small bright blue bubble. The suit's bright blue bubble disappeared from the suit and the man looked up to where Tony was. Force then pushed his feet up off of the ground and sailed over to where Tony was currently hovering. Tony looked behind him and then pushed his own suit up and away from the damaged part of New York City. Sailing over towards one of the building sites that was currently empty, Tony started to weave and perform a slalom run all around the currently erected metal girders that had come up out of the concrete base and towards the currently empty second floor. Every so often, Tony looked over his shoulder and Tony could see that the blue suited metal man was still coming with him as well. That was enough for Tony to keep going with him, the suits were all missing their arc reactors and there were no batteries on Earth that could even come close to hanging with his arc reactor.

""You can't do this forever Stark!"" The voice called out to him, prompting a chuckle from Tony as he sailed up high into the air, breaking past the skyline and all the way up to where the clouds were. Force followed and his bright blue hand came up to grab at Tony's ankle, making the man in the red and yellow suit look down at him.

**""Oh I can do. How's your battery life though?""**

""Battery-"" Force couldn't say anything else, the suit had already powered down and was plummeting down towards the ground. Tony managed to wriggle himself free and followed the suit down towards the ground. Landing on top of the metal suit, the suit that had now cracked the concrete and spread out beneath it like a spider's web. Tony landed on top of the suit and pressed the palm of his hand down onto the chest and with a single jolt of energy the suit was permanently disabled. Opening up a compartment on his wrist, Tony plucked out a series of powerful magnets and pressed them to the wrists of Force, pinning the suit to the ground and keeping him in a position to be picked up.

**""Computer? Get S.H.I.E.L.D on the line, one more to be taken away.""**

""Tony!?"" Another voice came on the line and Tony recognised it instantly. 

**""Anatol? What's happening?""**

""You need to get here! It's... Oh God... It's awful!""

Tony looked over towards Stark Tower and it was then that he saw another tall pillar of smoke rising up from it.

What the hell had happened..."
9n0le0,2,2018-10-10,I need to vent,s1cknt1red,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9n0le0/i_need_to_vent/,"Hello everyone.

I really need to talk about this thing that happened today.

Just some quick info about my situation. I was diagnosed with PCOS a couple years ago. I started gaining weight and losing confidence, and that paired up with a shitty narc mother, my life sucked. It was a difficult time, where I had no friends to trust and rely on. And the friends I made and had that were nice, were mocked by my mother, enough for me to sabotage myself and my friendships with those people.

Fast forward to today. I have started taking care of myself. I have a part time job and in my last year to complete my Masters degree. I have made a few good friends, I love my colleagues, I like my classmates and absolutely adore my boss and my thesis professor. I got an appointment with a dietitian who is really sweet and considerate, and I am going to the gym and eating well. I have managed to balance my studies, work, extra curricular activities and health harmoniously, and I feel I am reaching my peak.

I started going to my dietitian since the beginning of September. I have lost nearly 5 kilos and feel so confident and happy. My colleagues and friends are complimenting me, 8 am building muscle and feel so much healthier and happier.

So today was another follow up session with my dietitian. But my mom (similar to a few weeks ago) throws a fit and starts telling me my dietitian is a whore who is just using me for my money. She is questioning the dietitian's motives and expertise, even though her plans have worked perfectly with me, since they are customized for my syndrome. She tries to call her and shout at her but she doesnt pick up, which I guessed was because she was busy with another client. I told her I didnt want to half ass things because I was always forced to neglect any plan any doctor gave me. And I was honestly tired of going to a doctor and getting medication upon medication, which fucked up my mood and self. She made me consider not going but I told her I would pay for the visit myself since my health was very important.

We ended up going there and on our way she uses the ""half ass"" comment I made earlier, to tell me that I haven't stuck to the plan and that I am irresponsible etc etc.

We see the doctor and she goes in to ask her a question taking the time of the client before us. Which was really fucking rude but anyway. When we were talking I was so frustrated that I started getting teary. She immediately turned it into ""omg my darling, these doctors care so much about you"" while speaking in our native language (not english) and asking why my face is so angry looking, in a nice tone. I nearly started crying and just left the office to go to the bathroom. I think the doctors saw my reaction. I messaged my brother who was away at school, telling him that I wished he was here. I was really upset and wanted someone to be there for me.

When I got back the doctor's intern mentioned something which got to me.. she told me that I have too much stress and frustration in my environment. I need to relax as much as I should so that I could have a peace and calm of mind. It broke me but it was a good wake up call because I was waiting for someone from outside to mention this to me. And all that in front of my mother.

I told them that it was rude of us to take the client's time and that we can speak during my appointment.

While we were waiting for the doctor to finish with the other client, my mother said this really stupid thing: ""you're too stressed. Maybe you should calm down."" Lol wtf? That's no different than telling a depressed person to cheer up. She then said ""your job is so stressful. It is destroying you"". She doesnt want me to have a job, this was confirmed the day I got it. She makes fun of my colleagues and boss, and complains about everything to do with my job. I told her my job was not the problem. And neither was my studies. She then guessed it is my dog, which is bullshit. My dog is one of the reasons I wont kill myself. I love her more than myself. I told her that her lack of mental and psychological support and the way I'm treated is the reason for my stress. She rolls her eyes but it gets to her because I stood up for myself. I stay distant with her until we get into the office, and everyone including my doctor notices some tension.

She starts showing off in the office and says look at what my daughter is doing. Losing weight and all. But most of the time she makes me feel like shit by criticizing me. She gives the doctor incorrect info and when I correct her she tells me to stop being rude in front of the doctor. Either way, the interns correct her and tell her that the meetings should be weekly so that she could monitor my body and its behavior. She told me that I am stressed and need to try some relaxing exercises. What she said later kind of broke me because I dont usually expect people to say things like this: she told me she can guess what I am going through but that I can rely on her if I need anything. She said that we will work on this together but next time I should try to come to her office with happy thoughts and my humorous jokes like I usually do. I feel as though she did understand the situation, and she made an observation based on all those previous meetings. My mother was just silent about the whole thing because i guess she didnt expect that.

My doctor also called a gynecologist so that I can have a check up. Its scheduled for tomorrow and I am really nervous but slightly happy that I am taking course in my own life. 

Sorry if I ranted for too long, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I cant wait to leave this house."
9n0vsb,24,2018-10-10,Been lurking and think I’ll have a battle in the future,ScarletSunder,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9n0vsb/been_lurking_and_think_ill_have_a_battle_in_the/,"Hi, been lurking a bit and just to say you guys are awesome. I finally decided to kinda rant/ share story. I say no advice wanted but eh mild advice I guess is good. I think I’ll have a battle as both my mom and my long term boyfriends mom are both interesting to say the least. I’m an only child so is my mom. We are close due to that but boundaries do get over ridden a lot. Example I hate football but support my school. Mom buys season pass and expects to sleepover every home game. Fine now I got a studio to myself but was issues with my last roommate. I’m from the south so an overnight guest is annoying but do able. Context I’m in my early 20s, grad school, TA, working an internship to pay for school but rely on my parents for rent, food, etc. all my money is saved for school. My parents both do not like my boyfriend. We’ve been dating for 8 years and we are on different ends of SES. My parents work for government, got master’s, divorced, etc. Mom said it was puppy love when we started dating in high school. Mostly they are concerned he won’t be able to provide for me. Typical my only child is a daughter and we want the best. 

His mother.... gives the impression of never fully leaving her 20s responsibility wise. She got two kids. Him being the oldest (same age as me). Both his parents tend to place themselves over the kids a lot the dad a little less so (his ex-step dad who does more for him like pay his college). She divorced his ex step dad and they lost the house due to her not paying bills. (She would forget to pay power before the divorce so over other month it seemed power was out). Well after about a year last winter she decided to be apart of her kids lives again after spending a year on herself.  Due to her divorce agreement her rent, car, etc are provided not sure how child support works. Ex husband also buys groceries for her. But the main issues are due to her not taking the time to do basic parent things (ex step dad works every day but Sunday way past normal hours). They don’t have the money to pay off his last term of schooling so he can’t even transfer to a cheaper place, only just got a drivers license due to no one working/taking him (had to threaten breaking up as I moved two hours away for internship/grad school), works at a shop with ex step dad but does not have a bank account cause no will take him to re activate (due to no one giving him money for school like promised it got shut down) he cannot get his pay checks by direct deposit which is what that place only does, and cause is not helping there’s no money for him a functioning car so he is waiting till ex step dad can fix car. 

I worry for his little sister as she is not far from finishing high school and going off if they can afford it. She already wants a car like mine. His already depressed and has been for years. My current goals are just to keep him trying to get the bank sorted and the car so he can get a better job. The bank he has was closed last he visited. His ex step dad drives him to my city for the weekend due to lack of car. But I told him I drove for two years and I refuse to now. He does not feel like he is a priority for them. 

Super long so sorry 8 years of relationship make everything long. Oh if you are questioning why we haven’t just gotten married. College. And my grandma saying telling me no wedding gifts till 25. Again not looking for in depth advice. Comments/ concerns are welcomed. I kinda got the feeling once on his own his contact with his mom will be limited. My mom is not the best with kids but she’s more ‘normal ‘ so when that time comes I do have a preference on who babysits. Oh he is high functioning autistic can’t really tell. But he has Hobbies that become his world for a few months. Some go and come back. I even had to remind his mom he doesn’t like being out late or crowds. 🙄"
9n1hod,0,2018-10-10,Job Application Timeline (Wait for OSCP?),Http-ethaniel-me,netsecstudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/9n1hod/job_application_timeline_wait_for_oscp/,"Hello all!


I am a senior undergrad in a computer science program at a small, non-engineering university. I am getting pressured to apply for jobs right now, but am unsure if that is the best idea for me.

The reason for this is that I am getting academic credit for the OSCP next semester and should have it before I graduate. I have Sec+, PenTest+ and an obscure cert called CEISA (Certified Expert Intrusion Specialist Associate) but I really feel like OSCP will help me get a higher base salary as a pen tester or analyst.

I know certs aren't everything so I made sure to grab 2 security internships (private SOC analyst and DHS Honors Program) and have 8 years personal experience in many fields of hacking. I believe I could get an offer or two if I apply to a bunch of jobs now, but is it worth my time to wait? Has anybody had experiences applying to jobs 2-4weeks before graduation vs the 6-7 months that I am being heavily pressured into? Will the OSCP help me get paid a higher rate than what I have for certs and experience now?"

9n2dhj,23,2018-10-10,The After Party,[deleted],RapeFantasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/RapeFantasy/comments/9n2dhj/the_after_party/,"She was young, engaged, innocent, happy, but something was missing. Ella was an intern for an insurance company, on the road with a small group of coworkers far from home to close a deal with a possible big time client. I admire her innocence from a distance, she's a little shy, beautiful little face, someone like that would never be interested in me, which makes me that much more attracted to her. 

We close the deal, toast with a drink, I hadn't eaten all day so it gives me a small buzz almost immediately. Liquid courage, helps me talk to her, a little flirt, she doesn't flirt back, clearly not interested, she's so beautiful though. We all decided a celebration is in order, it's too late to go back, the company comped us a couple rooms at nice hotel that has a nice bar, we all went to our rooms to change into something more casual, her room was right next to mine.

I change rather quickly and go for a smoke on my room's private deck, as a take a long drag I reflect on what had just happened, kinda feel humiliated, my feeble attempts to flirt was not reciprocated. It's gonna be awkward. I shake my head look off into the distance, I notice the blinds to her sliding glass door are wide open. She's changing, completely naked, tattoos hug the curves of her body. Maybe she's not so innocent after all.

We all meet at the bar. It's a nice little gathering. Being socially awkward because I'm just picturing her naked below me, my cock keeps getting hard thinking about it. I gotta stop thinking about it, I keep making advances towards her and I keep getting shut down, but I can't stop thinking about it. The more I drink the more it clouds my head until it is every thought that passes through my head, fucking her, in every position possible, pure and raw passionate fucking. I can't even have a conversation with my peers because I can't even think of what they are saying. I'm completely enthralled right now. I can't believe I'm feeling like this, I'm a married man of 10 years.

It's getting late, the other 2 already left we are having another drink, laughing and joking, I'm able to suppress the urge to hit on her somehow. She says she needs a cigarette. I immediately go back to when I saw her changing while I was smoking, her perfect naked body, covered in tattoos, I bet her pussy smells divine, I bet her asshole tastes like heaven, dammit, I'm doing it again, stop it. 

I tell her I have a smoke she can have, she gladly accepts, we get up from the bar, she's quite tipsy, stumbles a little, and we make our way towards the parking lot, it's really late now, they are shutting down the bar, the lobby is empty, they put up the buzz for assistance sign at the desk, get to the parking lot, it's dark and quite, that dress she's wearing, the slight chill in the air are making her perky little nipples hard, those beautiful little nipples, on those beautiful breasts, that perfect little body, dammit, she's perfect, my cock is getting hard again.

We get to my car, I'm shaking, I hand her a cigarette but it falls to the ground, she bends over to pick it up, her beautiful ass pointing towards me, I have to, I reach my hand out and place it on her pussy, she shoots up to tell me to knock it off but before she can get the words out I grab her by the throat and slam her against the car. She's shaking, she lets out a small whimper, my other hand roughly grapping her breast and pinching her nipples, she gasps and quietly whimpers out for me to stop, but I can't, my cock is throbbing, I need this inside of her, my hand reaches back down to her pussy, it's wet, her panties are soaked, little slut, you want this.

My hand still on her throat, I force her down, she pleeds in a quiet whimpering whisper ""no, no, please, no"" but it's to late, I pull my cock out, I order her to open her mouth, reluctantly she complies, makeup running down her face from tears, I slowly put my cock in her mouth with gentle, firm thrusts, I can't believe it's happening, I give three hard thrusts, jamming my 8 inches of hard thick cock in as far as possible, almost going all the way in. She's able to pull her head away to gag with slobber coming out of her mouth, her eyes bloodshot with tears rolling down her beautiful makeup smeared face. I grab her by the arm and roughly pull her up. I tell her to keep her fucking mouth shut, and we make our way back to the entrance.

Still with a firm grip on her arm, I pull her towards the elevator, the lobby is empty, nobody knows, I push her in the elevator, she tries to run back out but. I push her back in and slam her against the wall, my hands searching her entire body, kissing her neck, "" no, please stop"" she says in a quiet but crying voice. My hand reaches back down to her pussy, it's so wet through her panties that her thighs have her pussy juices on them. It's our floor, I grab her arm again as the door opens.

It's a short walk around the corner to my door, I open it, she slips my grip but before she can get away I grab her by the hair and drag her through the doorway, she stumbles to the ground and looks up at me, trembling, I pick her up and roughly throw her on the bed, she's too scared to move, my hands slide down her outer thighs, her legs are shaking, in one fluid motion I rip her panties off, she gasps in fright, and tries to swing at me, but she misses. I then rustle her dress over her head, she's completely nude, beautiful, perfect slut.

I take my tie and tie her wrists to the bed post, her beautiful naked body laying before me, on her back, beautiful breast looking at me. I put my hands on her knees and say ""I'm going to taste you and I am going to take you"" as I force her legs apart, her pussy smells so good, I put my tongue on it, it is completely soaked, It's making the bed wet, I taste her asshole too, better than I imagined, I can't believe it's finally happening, I get up and put the tip of my dick on her pussy, I can hardly wait.

I push the head of my dick in, followed by a hard and deep thrust, she gasps and whimpers as my 8 inch throbbing cock buries into her pussy, it's so tight, it begins to quiver, her body tenses up, a rush of warm liquid gushes around my cock, did she? Did she just cum?

I keep pumping my cock in her tight pussy, she's trying to twist away from me but I'm too powerful, she lets out a loud cry ""please stop, I'm begging you!!"", I slap her and tell her to shut up ""please"" she sobs. I pull my cock out of her pussy to get her torn panties, I shove them in her mouth and say ""I told you to shut the fuck up!"" I get ready to put it back in, my dick is dripping wet from her soaked used pussy, I go a little lower, I put my dick on her asshole, she tries to say no but her mouth is full from her still wet panties. She shakes her head violently with her eyes wide open, I push my cock all the way in her asshole, her body tenses up and she muffles out a scream while her pussy once again gushes with her cum. I thrust slow but hard, each time I bury my cock she lets out a muffled scream, as I begin to fill her ass with my cum she once again quivers as she gushes again.

I get off of her, what have I done? I untie her and she quickly gathers her things and leaves. I don't sleep a wink that night, my life will be over, I will lose my job, get divorced, and her fiance will kill me. I go to my car in the morning, everyone else had left. I get in my car and notice a brown bag on the seat, inside of it is the torn panties, they still smell so divine. That little slut, she liked it. I drove back to the office, the rest of my other peers are already there, including Ella, one of the guys asked what took me so long, Ella looks at me with a smirk and says ""Yeah, what took you so long? You have a rough night?""

My perfect little slutty angel, I knew you liked it.

&amp;#x200B;

Just another kid who grew up in San Diego and is itching to move back after having lived elsewhere and finding nothing to be as great as SD (and TJ).

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about me... I completed a bachelor's in Marketing about 2 years ago and already have some sales and marketing experience ranging from part-time retail jobs to internships to full-time positions. But I'm really not interested in continuing with that field so I quit my job a few months back and am currently at home studying full-time and working on a B.S. in Software Development.

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked a bit on freeCodeCamp and other similar resources, most of which were web-development focused and I feel competent enough for an internship or something similar, but I'm not sure how much I would like web development (specifically front-end).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I've decided to double down on learning Python as well and am wondering what the job market is like for python developers in something such as enterprise software or another ""boring"" but more stable part of the software development world.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the great thing about the degree I'm working on is that it'll also include Big IT certifications such as CompTIA A+, Project+, among others, and the software and programming classes will be Java-focused. So I'm also open to getting my foot in the door in the San Diego tech scene by leveraging any other relevant/in-demand skills in the area."

So why do I hate seeing you with another person.,fightingdailystress,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9n2zlb/even_in_my_dreams_we_dont_work_together_so_why_do/,"I broke up with my ex about a year ago. During this time we didn’t go no contact because reasons and we hoped to remain friends. Quickly it became evident that we still had strong feelings for each other so we tried again. And again. Each time the relationship fell apart for the same reasons- he would expect too much of me, I’d try to coast or not put enough effort into it, we’d have a huge blow up fight or somewhere in between all three. While we still cared for each other, to me it became clear that we were not compatible. So I broke it off for the last time and have been no contact for 3 months. 

I’ve been great during this time- working out, finally landed an internship, picking up new hobbies and working hard. Sure he still slips into my mind, but I have unfollowed him on everything and have blocked him from messaging me for both our sakes. During this time he found a new girlfriend. Which shouldn’t bother me. Even when I dream about him and my dream self gets back with him everything feels wrong and it doesn’t work out. So why do I feel this weird feeling of almost possessiveness about it? I don’t want him to be with someone else, and I don’t want to be with him. I don’t resent him or anything, and I truly want to be happy for him. I feel guilty that I’m even mildly bothered by this simple act of someone moving on from me. I’ve done it to him, albeit in a different way. 

I don’t know, this is just a long ramble. I hope someone else out there can relate. "

""Rain. Of course there had to be rain out tonight."" Yolanda shook her coat a few times before handing it over to the doorman. Rodrigo followed suit and quickly joined his sister as she marched up the stairs in frustration. ""I regret accepting the invitation to come to this stupid thing.""

Rodrigo looked down at the invitation. It still had some droplets of water on it, but he could make it out. ""What was this thing anyway? My invitation said it was for us to pick an intern from the military to help us with out research.""

Yolanda stopped walking. ""My invitation said we could expect leading researchers from the rest of Europe to come and discuss their findings.""

They looked at one another before both turning their heads to see two young adults walking arm in arm from a hallway to the right of the stairwell.

""...and that's how we managed to build the ships with only half a pie left!""

The darker skinned young woman threw her head back in laughter. ""Jorge, you idiot! Only you could make that work.""

Then those two looked at the doctors with an odd expression. ""Twins."" Said Jorge. ""You two must be Yolanda and Rodrigo. Twin doctors who work with the mentally unsound.""

""Mentally unsound."" Yolanda scoffed. ""That's a nice way of putting it. Yes, we are the Guzman twins, here to attend some scientific conference. What are you two doing here?""

Victoria, Jorge's girlfriend, looked at her invitation. ""Mine says a music convention where I can compete for 'fabulous prizes' in a talent portion.""

Jorge peered over to her invitation. ""You're kidding."" His eyes scanned the paper and he looked at the other two. ""Let me guess. Your invitations are also different and say nothing about an engineering workshop with Dutch levee builders."" The older adults shook their heads as if to say no. ""Great. Just great.""

The four stood around before Victoria broke the silence. ""So... we all have been invited here for a particular reason. If anything, it was probably Nieve's doing to get us all together. So let's go find him.""

Her logic was sound, so the four decided to follow their invitations to where the 'grand hall' was supposed to be found. And when they opened the creaky doors, they one lone table with 4 chairs, lit only by candlelight and a crystal-ball. The rest of the large-ish sized room was empty. And though there were no windows, they could still hear the thunder roaring outside.

No sooner did they close the door behind them did they fly open again, making the four visitors jump in alarm. All except Rodrigo who shrieked louder than he would've liked.

""This doesn't look like a ghost-themed orgy."" Said Nieve. He then glanced at Jorge, Victoria, Rodrigo, and Yolanda. ""Aaaaaand I am suddenly less excited at seeing the other guests at this party.""

""It's not an orgy."" Said Jorge flatly. ""All our invitations said different things.""

Diaz looked down at his invitation and gazed over to Graciela's. ""Yes. A shooting range with political prisoner's is not the same as a secretary's spa getaway.""

Graciela snatched her invitation back from Diaz's wandering hands and rolled her eyes. ""So which one of you idiots decided it would be fun to drag us away from out duties? I was half hoping this was all a mix-up and we came to the Great Hall to see what the truth was. So help me God if one of you-""

""It was neither of them."" Yet \*another\* voice called out from behind them, causing them all to turn. Behind the glass-ball sat a lone figure. Her dark raven hair was unruly curly, her emerald green eyes shined even from the middle of the room, and her accent was unmistakably foreign. Eastern European, Jorge would guess. ""It was me.""

""Gypsies?"" Diaz was surprised. ""I knew Muslims were trying to invade Spain, but I thought the gypsies died in the blast or something.""

""They are like cockroaches."" Said Nieve. ""They never die.""

The gypsy woman chuckled. ""We prefer zombies or ghosts if you are going to draw our comparison to our inability to die but this 'cockroach' somehow managed to get all 7 of you here. Seven of New Spain's most important people. Together. With me and the other peasants who I had help me clean the place up.""

""And let me guess,"" Yolanda was reaching the end of her patience. ""You wanted us to come together to contact the dead or something equally stupid.""

""The greater forces that be do not appreciate your sarcasm."" The gypsy woman beckoned for them to come closer. ""The wind is howling loudly and you have nothing else to do for the day as your hotel rooms have already been booked.""

""How did she-"" Nieve was cut off by her.

""Sit. Sit and I can divine unto you all a vision of the past, present, or future. Of what has passed, what is passing, and what will pass.""

For whatever reason (boredom, curiosity, fear, nothing else to do) the 7 walked up and sat in the circle. The gypsy woman held our her hands for Nieve and Graciela to take, and everyone else did the same until everyone was holding hands with their person on the left and right.

""*Spirits of the night, I beseech thee,Find favor with mine call and summons,On the seven winds I beg thee travel,And greet me in mine presence,For a speaking of things that need bespoke,From this moment hence,Thy powers do I wish invoke,For things that need be done.*""

9n3gx0,4,2018-10-10,Tax Accountant Interview,GetBlixted,taxpros,https://www.reddit.com/r/taxpros/comments/9n3gx0/tax_accountant_interview/,"Just a quick question.

&amp;#x200B;

This past tax season I had an internship at a small, local CPA office (only one CPA) where I did a lot of individual Tax Prep and a few business returns using Ultra Tax. Along with that, I did some QuickBooks work. I also have my  Bachelors degree in Accounting and plan on getting my Masters of Taxation within 5 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have an interview with a regional CPA Firm next week for a Tax Accountant position. I am just wondering what I can expect with the interview? What kind of questions can I expect to get asked? My interviews never seem to go amazingly, I just kind of get by with them.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your experiences with Tax Accountant interviews, and what was the day-to-day job like?

Thanks guys/gals"
9n3zmk,2,2018-10-10,The Right City for a Software Engineering Graduate,woculoye,SameGrassButGreener,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/9n3zmk/the_right_city_for_a_software_engineering_graduate/,"I'm graduating from my SE program this December, and I'm going to start sending my resume out in a week. I am looking at cities to focus my applications on. I was hoping for some recommendations/feedback for cities (US). I have had two internships, both in developing software for the Navy in two private companies. I generally prefer stability and peacefulness over a booming night life, and am generally a boring person. I'm not terribly concerned about being in a 'tech hub', just in having a good job with other options nearby should something go wrong.  I'm spending a lot of time researching to try to figure out the best city for me, and was hoping for other people's insights.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of my preferred traits, from most important to least:

\-Generally nice to live in

\-Not a huge population (100,000-600,000 range)

\-Decent to great tech scene/job market

\-Good salary/cost of living ratio

\-No further south than North Carolina, no further north than Massachusetts.

\-East coast or no more than 5 hours or so from the east coast (family nearby and have to drive with a cat)

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my top picks currently, in order:

Raleigh NC - Everything looks great except it is a bit on the larger side and a bit on the hot side.

Pittsburgh PA - Middle sized, decent tech scene, generally looks like a nice city

Norfolk VA - Near the water. The area as a whole isn't particularly amazing though, and I'm worried about flooding/rising waters hurting the area even more. Also not known for tech jobs, but there seemed to be a lot of positions last I looked.

Richmond VA - Not known for tech jobs, but in a nice location and a has a good sized population for my tastes.

Thanks for any input"
9n42yf,0,2018-10-10,I sometimes hate being in the U.S. as an international student and then I feel pathetic for thinking it.,pieholic,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/9n42yf/i_sometimes_hate_being_in_the_us_as_an/,"I’ve lived in the United States for over half my life. From 3~ 10, and from 14~ 19 (current). I love America because its such a large country that’s infinitely less stressful than my birth nation. (Middle school friend committed suicide in my birth nation for academic reasons so it really hits home sometimes)

When I had to chose between going to college here and going to college in Korea, I chose America because I thought American colleges would have much more money and experience for me (which is still true) I also wanted to stay with my parents whose work was in America for the time being.

I had an ok SAT and ACT score and I took SAT subject tests for good measure. I applied to a dream school with my American friends. We all had similar SAT scores (high 2200s ~ low 2300s range) I think I was the only one with SAT subject test scores. (800 on math, 750?740?on physics) My counselors, parents, and I all expected that we would be accepted together. I was the only one not accepted. Because I am not a citizen, I was competing with other international students. Also, the school apparently was accepting less international students that year because they overdrafted the year before that. On top of that, my parents work sent them back to Korea and I had already locked in my course for an American university. I would be going to college without my family’s support, with an F-1 instead of an L-2.

I went to a different university- it’s not a bad one by any means, and I’ve met some amazing people and had great experiences so far. I’ve had friends send me links for internships, but mostly they only look for American citizens. I had an interview with a company recently, but they turned me down after the final interview.
One of my questions for them during the interview was whether they could help me for OPT(internship for F-1 visa). I wonder if I shouldn’t have done that, but its a bridge I have to cross at some point so I try to get it out of my mind and improve my personal skills instead.

Recently, I had a video interview with a big company in Atlanta- I thought I’d failed it but apparently they loved me and I would be attending a cocktail party on Thursday and interview Friday - all expenses paid. My friend works there and he was super excited for me and literally drove over an hour to sit down with me and prep for the interview. 

I was extremely happy as well, because during a video interview, the first question they asked was whether I’d need sponsoring and I had answered truthfully. I figured that the invite for the final interview meant that they would either make an exception for me, or they were a company that would sponsor.

Unfortunately, that was not the case becase I received a phone call from the hiring manager saying that during a review of my video interview, they found that I needed sponsorship. Apparently they missed it the first time (it was a weedout question like I assumed) and they were sorry but wanted to tell me before the interview tomorrow.

So I’m kind of in a mess right now and it really sucks because I don’t want to tell my parents. They already feel guilty that they weren’t able to get nationalized for me, and I get nightmares sometimes about the time where my mom told me crying at the airport that she was sorry that she couldn’t give birth to me 3 years later. They don’t know I had any type of interview whatsoever. I also don’t want to tell my friend bc he invested so much trying to help me and honestly there’s nothing he can do.

I also have a software engineering test tomorrow so I really should be reviewing and making last minute notes but I can’t focus and I’ve been sniffling softly on and off in the library for the past hour or so. I honestly don’t know where I’m going with this but writing stuff that bothers me in a notepad used to help, but this time it didn’t so I’m using anonymity and reddit. 

I’ve never felt more alienated from my friends, and suddenly, every failure I’ve had so far gets the tag “what if I was American?” When there are definitely cases where I could have just tried harder. I realize that and I feel pathetic, but then the phone call replays itself in my head, complete with my replying in a dead voice “I understand ma’am, thank you so much for tellig me this, have a good day” and then I am filled with self pity again. I’ve never felt more denied. Usually I’m really good with laughing stuff off including stereotypes and light racism, but this kind of kills me. I’m not sure which companies specifically offer sponsorship and OBT, and I guess with the thousands of other international students like me, it will be swamped with applications.

Suddenly, I am filled with the anxiety that I will not be able to make it here, which is probably true considering that I’m just a slightly above average student. I’m not sure what I’m doing here anymore. I am scheduled to graduate December 2019 but now, instead of it seeming like a new phase, it looks like the end of the line.

And if you are an international student reading this, don’t base yourself off your American peers. You have to be better at them in every way. Because you aren’t competing in the same criteria. You’re competing with every other international student from around the world for a smaller opening. I think it took me too long to learn but I hope you don’t make the same mistakes I do. Don’t be satisfied when people say you’ve made it. Be satisfied when you actually make it. When I am done with self pity, I will work harder on my major and see what I can do better to stand out. It may be too late for me though and I might have to go back.

9n4e0f,5,2018-10-10,Advice on finding a master's advisor (for CSCI Coterminal Program),throwaway_coterm,RPI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/9n4e0f/advice_on_finding_a_masters_advisor_for_csci/,"TL;DR: Any advice on how to reach out to potential MS advisors? Or how to come up with/join a research project? Even if you don't have any advice on this program specifically, I'd still love to hear about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, so I'm a junior, but I have enough credits that I could graduate with a B.S. in CSCI this coming May, (if I picked up a 5-credit semester next year).

I really want to apply to the CSCI coterminal program to stay for my fourth year, but I've been so focusing on bringing my GPA up to the requirement that I've completely neglected what is probably the most important preparation to make for the program- finding an advisor. I'm absolutely totally lost when it comes to this- I know enough that you shouldn't just email random people, but I have almost no idea what the correct way to go about this is.

For starters, I don't have a solid idea on what my project/thesis would be. I want to study machine learning, and I think I have an okay background in this- I took Learning and Adv Game AI last semester, and worked with neural networks / simulated annealing in my internship over the summer. Still, I don't exactly know what I would like to write a thesis/make a project about- procedural content generation networks, maybe?- and my understanding is that typically you should have a solid idea before you approach someone about being an advisor. Is this correct? Or is it more normal to, say, join a pre-existing project, or come up with a concrete idea in co-operation with your advisor?

In addition, it seems like very few of the CSCI faculty are actually working in machine learning- most of that work seems to be done in COGSCI, and your advisor explicitly needs to be a CS faculty member. I'd be happy to apply to the COGSCI program, although judging by the ""january 30 of your junior year"" deadline, that ship seems to have sailed.

That being said, I'd be happy to be working in another area, although I do not have any idea of potential projects in other fields of computer science. I'd like to contact some of my current or former professors: does anyone have any insight on a polite way to do this? In addition, can anyone provide any insight on applying to CSCI research groups?

I'd very much like to hear from anyone who has been through this process before, in any department. Thanks very much!"

He was attractive and nice and I didn't think too much about it giving him my number cuz he didnt set off any red flags.

Holy cow this boy is CLINGY! 
I'm extremely busy cuz I do school full time and have a job and internship and a million other things.

He'll text me every hour or two until I reply and scold me if I take too long cuz ""its not cool to leave someone hanging"" Not like I'm currently at work or something when he texts me apparently! 

I have depression and have also been having some rough days. so I told him I'm a little out of it- depression- blah blah blah 

""We can talk about it!  I can come over right now with food and we can talk about it!"" He tried inviting himself over several times. 

Seeing how clingy he was, I cancelled the date we had planned. It took 6 hours and me eventually stop writing back to get him to just let it go I wasn't going out. 

A few days later, I essentially had to break up with him (yes through text. But also... we never even went on ONE DATE!) 

No response for 5 days. And now he's writing me again like I never said anything and is even calling me. 

I don't know what to do. I should block him. But he also apparently knows the general area I live and I'm a little worried he might stalk me or something.

Edit: Let me just add to my ""essentially had to break up with him"" I did straight up say things are not working out between us... thats why Im surprised and confused why he's writing me like I said nothing. It seems like he just ignored the text tbh."

Ballpoint Penboy

As a young inkblot, they loved and cherished their dog above all else . Their family was extremely poor, and could barely support them, as they had a speech impediment and often required extra classes at school. Bullied consistently for their speech impediment, gender fluidity and appearance, Penboy began to fall behind in school. One day, their bullies caught them walking their dog, and separated the two-tormenting them separately before leaving the dog whimpering on a random street corner. Desperate to find their one and only friend in this hellish life, Penboy searched for him for days. Finally, they found him-happy with another family. The other family was kind and welcoming-they offered to give the dog back, thankful that the dog had such a kind and wonderful owner. However, Penboy could not convey their feelings properly with their speech impediment, and the family misinterpreted their gratitude as acceptance that the dog would have a better life with them- leaving with the dog. Penboy accepted this-they knew their dog would be happier with this family.

But school only got worse. The bullying and torment grew harsher- their parents eventually divorced, neither of whom wanted custody of their ""broken"" child. They became homeless and dropped out of school, living for many years on their own.

Eventually, they fell into crippling debt- they had taken out a loan to help their girlfriend out of debt, who was picked up by a modeling company soon after and dumped them without ever paying them back. In order to raise the funds they needed, they became involved with the black market, and eventually met Bebop, who introduced them to the life of petty crime.

The battle against Gunner and his intern was supposed to have been their last crime-after that, they would have finally paid off their debt. Their girlfriend had come back after making it big in the modelling business to help them pay off their debt, and the two were to be married in December-they were going to get a new puppy together. Unfortunately, their life was tragically cut short in the battle…

Or so we thought.

In reality, Penboy clung on to dear life, and was eventually found by a mysterious group of villains. Admiring their strength and determination, the villains revived Penboy, giving them cybernetic enhancements, which boosted their strength and speed.

He returns as…Ballpoint Penboy!

(Rough Idea),Soupandsaladbarfan,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9n5ycf/m4f_the_intern_affair_rough_idea/,"I would love to play out a scene where you are an intern at my company; its not a well paying job, but its in the field you want so you take what you can get. Despite the low pay, you always seem to be dressed better then the other interns and you are open about not coming from money. During your nights you make the vast majority of your money as an escort, its not something you are proud of, but you have your fun and your clients treat you well. 

I would be rich, married and the last person that anyone would expect to cheat on their wife. You've met her a few times as shes come to the office and you've seen how we interact as she perfectly placed by my side. You do have a bit of a crush on me as you do like older men, but push it aside to remain professional.

The scene would start with your arrival at a room for a new client, which of course be me. Would love to explore your submission to not only a client you are attracted to, but to your boss that could ruin your job and to a potential sugar daddy if you are worth what the escort company charges. 

I wouldnt know who I was getting until I open the door so it would be a surprise to us both. But if you are willing we can explore my marriage and how you would fit in after our initial night together.

Kinks: Anal, creampies, cock worship, cheating, passionate blowjobs, desire, rough and intense sex, public play, shower sex, voice play (if you are willing)

My name is Scott and I'm 42. I'm about 6'5 and 225 pound with reddish brown hair with bits of grey. I'm in pretty good shape and you can tell as you've seen how my clothes cling to my body. I've got a bit of chest hair and hair on my abs along with a thick 8 inch cock."

&amp;#x200B;

I need some help with some issues I'm facing. I recently started using marijuana as a substitute during recovery from my sex addiction (started last week). During my high, i get memories that i never knew i had. So if your interested please be prepared to read, because I'm starting from the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

It begins as a kid i always had difficulty learning as I did so poorly in school and grew up in a household that promoted corporal punishment as a corrective action. I remember as far back as grade 2, my first traumatic event occured which I think is important as one of the largest turning points in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

My classmate recently divulged some top secret information regarding making a bomb using a few matchsticks tied together with a rubber band. Out of my need for his approval, and my own curiosity, i stole a pack from my kitchen and later that day I tried to start a fire in the classroom.  I was caught before anyone got hurt, thankfully, and was sent to the principals office until school ended with a phone call home. I contemplated running away when the school bus dropped me off. After weighing my options, I thought it might not be as bad, so i went into my house. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father didn't say anything as he walked towards me, calm and collected. I thought to myself, maybe he didn't get a call, and i was okay for now and started taking off my shoes. I heard a ringing as I was airborne for a little bit before hitting the floor, not knowing what happened. After coming to my senses and realizing my life was over, I saw him take out the nefarious audio video cables and thought it was going to be painful.  That day i experienced the event that changed a stupid child into an obsessive fear driven A+ student.

&amp;#x200B;

From that experience, I had straight A's going forward, with an obsessive need to be a teachers pet. Getting her approval on my intelligence exceeding that of my peers was my top priority. The beginning of my OCD, which got worse as I experienced the harsh apathy of high school teachers and obsessed even more over my grades.

&amp;#x200B;

The depression wasn't too apparent as a teenager, I was genuinely happy for a little while, I fell in reciprocated love. My father on the other hand, was killing himself by drinking his sadness and anger away after several hours in dialysis. One night, it was just me and him at the house and we had fight about me not giving him water when he asked. I cried as i tried to calm my anger down when he yelled i was not his son.

&amp;#x200B;

As he sincerely apologized the next day, he subtly asked if I wanted him to die. Out of my anger from the night before I didn't say no. My greatest regret, that still brings me to the brink of breaking down to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

He passed away a few weeks later. He died while having grasped my hand earlier that day in the hospital, as i helplessly watched him struggle for air in agony. 

&amp;#x200B;

My family had to readjust our lives, relocate to escape all the friendly debt collectors and recover. Still saving to pay them to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter university, with all its competitive programs and my highly refined skills as an OCD driven overachiever. My depression began during the internship phase of my program, where i was constantly rejected by companies and my ego plummeted like stock from the dotcom bubble burst. 

Luckily, I was able to secure an internship a year later than my peers which in one way helped alleviate some of the depression but my ego never recovered. 

&amp;#x200B;

During that time i was single, always was, and still am. I failed at basic human instinct and lead me to begin my addiction to marijuana. That developed through graduation, and peaked while i failed at a promotion opportunity at my job.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I get high after work and think about how im an ugly piece of shit, that conned his way to a job, that can't even fulfill my evolutionary purpose of reproducing, and sympathizes with my father on why he treated me the way he did. He was depressed, like i am now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm terribly sorry for my writing, my english was never really good. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is my sadness, all of it. 

I still haven't found someone who could tell me the right words to help me overcome it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for hearing me out. Whoever reads this deserves a hug, who ever can tell me the right answer I will love you forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Ben sat in quiet on a bench in Yancy Street, watching the children run through the road playing football. He smiled to himself and reflected to his time in college, he’d become fast friends with Reed, Johnny and Sue there… Well, maybe not Johnny. Johnny was too focused on other concerns. But he’d met him all the same. A sheet of newspaper floated past in the breeze and down the street, whipping past the neighbourhood boys. Ben tilted his head as a figure in black sat down beside him, hair tied back into a bun behind her head.

“Hello Ben.” She spoke, passing a folder of paper to him. “My name is Maria Hill.”

Ben turned his eyes downwards to the manila canvas, the edge of several pieces of paper threatening to slide out. He turned his eyes back up to her and raised a rocky brow. “That supposed to mean something?”

“I represent SHIELD.” She replied, sitting straight and holding the folder out. “I wish for your help, and to offer you a place as an agent of SHIELD.”

Ben scoffed in amusement and took the folder from her hand, rolling it into a ball. “A guy with metal tentacles took you outta the sky. I think I’ll take a pass. ‘Sides, I ain’t no spy.”

“Clearly.” Maria agreed, looking him up and down. “But you’re a powerhouse, and sometimes we need those.”

Ben narrowed his eyes a little and looked over the documentation. He could do some good… He had the skin and the strength for it. “Alright. I’m in.”a

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

Maria Hill’s light footsteps were echoed by Ben’s as the two of them stepped into the command center of the new Helicarrier. The agents within paused to look towards them both, until so far as Maria’s stare scared them back to their work assignments. Ben whistled, impressed, at the sight before him. The windows of the carrier had an overlay on them, reports and information from all across the globe, with a huge marker on one of the window devoted to Doom and the situation in the Balkans. Ben’s jaw clenched down, and his fists tensed. Maria raised her brow and glanced to the same sight.

“We’re not sending you after him. We have another task in mind.” She tapped a button on a keyboard, the central window changed its display. Ben wondered which poor intern had been assigned the role of setting up this presentation. On the screen the pale blue outline of a white man appeared- and not just caucasian, but ghostly white. His features didn’t seem wholly white either, in Ben’s eyes.

“Lonnie Lincoln, Thirty-Four. He’s known to have associations with all the crime organisations in the city, supplying them a great amount of weaponry, mostly, but he also runs one of the local motorcycle clubs. Most crimes with vehicles can be traced back to him in some way.”

Ben snorted in amusement. “You guys can’t bring him in?”

“He’s strong, elusive, well armed and surrounded by goons.” Maria responded, pressing another button. “We don’t know where to find him. But we do have some ideas where to start.”

Ben scoffed. “Tell ya what. I’ll find the way to him- I know a guy who’ll lead me to the right path. Even if I have to drag him towards it.”

Maria looked up and him, and shrugged her shoulders. “Alright, I’ll let you take lead.”

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Turk Barrett rolled down the back door of his van and span on his heel. The orange stonework before him hadn’t been there before, that much was certain to him. He glanced up towards the head of the figure before him and grinned, arms out to the side, palm open.

“Ben baby! Long time no see, how ya doing?” Turk asked, as charismatic as he was rich. He lowered his arms and sighed as Ben crossed his own, stare becoming much more intense. Turk shrugged his shoulders and moved to the right, trying to slip around Ben. Ben pushed his left hand out, holding Turk up by the collar, pinning him against the back of the truck surface. Turk squeaked, cleared his throat and tilted his head, attempting to coolly play off the momentary noise. “Alright, what’s got you goat this time? Someone piss on Yancy Street?”

“Tombstone.” Ben stated simply, narrowing his eyes. “I know you’re selling to him.”

“Nah man. I ain’t selling shit to him. ‘Sides, what evidence you got?”

“How about this.” Ben leans in. “You tell me. And I don’t give you to SHIELD.”

“Am I even in their jurisdiction?”

“Do you want to find out?” Ben muttered.

“Point taken my man. So… What can I do for you?”

“Tell me where he is. That’s all I want to know.”

“Wait, you working for SHIELD? Cats one of my best buyers, why you gotta do this, BG?”

“Because without him, the streets are safer. Harlem is safer. Midtown is safer. Yancy is safer. All of Manhattan is far safer.”

“That’s gonna interrupt my business, baby.” Turk responded, sighing deeply.

“You always find another buyer. Now talk.”

“Aight. You’ll find him at Worth Street Station. But if he asks how you found him, don’t name drop me.”

“I would never.” Ben replied, leaning in. “You’re too good a rat.”

Ben dropped Turk, turned, and stepped away from the hapless dealer. He paused, turned on his heel and pointed. “And if I ever catch you around Yancy, I’m dragging you to SHIELD.”

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

Worth Street Station. Closed down when they began construction on the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station finished in the 60s, it wasn’t needed anymore. Ben slammed a fist into the boarding and ripped the hole wider, stepping through the mess of wood splinters and graffiti. He turned his head from left to right and descended the barely lit steps, decorated with posters from the time still, advertising concerts for The Beatles, The Who, even an old newspaper from The Bugle lay dessicated upon the steps. Ben looked to the left and right as he entered the station platform, hearing the sound of speech from far further down. He lacked the element of surprise here, but he didn’t mind. He had is fists and his strength, that was enough. His footsteps carried him towards the noise, and into the slightly surprised arms of a dozen men, well armed, holding a variety of small arms.

“You don’t wanna do this.” Ben warned. “I’m just here for Tombstone.”

“You know we gotta.” One of them states, shrugging his shoulders. “Getting knocked out by you is far more preferrable.”

Ben tilts his head and nods slowly. “Ya know… You make a good point. I’ll go gentle.”

&amp;nbsp;

—

&amp;nbsp;

Tombstone opened his arms out wide and grinned a razor sharp grin, Ben didn’t return the smile, dropping the black ball that was, formerly, a pistol.

“Welcome, Thing, to my parlour.” Tombstones voice was deep, Harlem based. Ben should have guessed Lincoln had roots there, crime ran as rampant as the rats in the city. “Old as it may be.”

Ben wasn’t amused by the statement. “It’s okay.”

Lincoln unzipped the jacket he wore on his person and folded it, the leather was worn, the jacket likely older than they both were. He placed it upon the fading bin beside him and rolled the sleeves of his shirt up, once, twice, three times and finally, a fourth time, to make sure they didn’t slip down. “I usually wear a suit. But you caught me off guard. I apologise for the… Lack of presentation.”

“I wouldn’t worry.” Ben spoke, crossing his arms over his chest and giving the man a moment to prepare themselves. This fight wasn’t going to go down easily, no use rushing it. “It’s a nice jacket, shame to ruin it.”

“I appreciate the gesture.” Tombstone nodded. “Now then… Shall we begin?”

Ben darted forwards, uncrossing his arms and swinging his left fist. Tombstone caught it and pushed it down, his hand clocking Ben across the jaw. Ben staggered back and kicked his foot out hard, colliding with Tombstone’s stomach and sliding them back along the station platform, thick grey dust kicked up around them both. Tombstone smiled in response and put his arms up in front of him, knuckles pointed to the roof. The rumbling of the train carriages echoed behind him, announcing the arrival of an approaching train. Tombstone turned his head a little, adjusted his feet and prepared. Ben noticed the shift and darted forwards to grab Tombstone. The albino shifted his stance and caught Ben, the two tumbling into the Subway train as it rocketed past, the silver car shaking on the rails and the passengers within screaming. Glass shattered, steel bent and the paper advertisements tore as the two made their own doorway, through the seats.

The two unpaid passengers rolled onto the floor until Ben kicked Tombstone off of them. The two quickly rose to their feet and Tombstone darted forwards, arms wrapping around Ben as they charged into the next carriage along. Ben grabbed Tombstone by the head and pushed him away, slamming their head down onto Ben’s knee. The albino’s head bounced back and they grinned again, fist socking Ben in eye. Ben staggered back, momentarily blinded and Tombstone shoved them hard, Ben’s form buckling the side of this new carriage, head sliding out of the window. Tombstone lifted their feet, pushing them further out of the window, into the awaiting pillars that held the tunnel up.

Ben was dragged out of the carriage with a loud **TWANG.**

Ben’s foot hooked onto the side of the prior carriage and he span, facefirst into the side of it. His fists moved quickly, smashing through the graffiti’d glass and latching onto the seat inside. He pulled his body through, and came face to face with a small child.

“Hi Mr. Thing!” She announced, smiling up at him. Ben smiled back, and looked up as the train slowed. Brooklyn Bridge Station, now was a chance to grab Tombstone before he vanished into the crowds. He got to his feet and strode through the doors, stepping onto the station, the uncaring crowds flowing around him as he exited. He looked left, then right, and growled to himself. A flash of white caught his attention, Tombstone moving up ahead. Ben began to push through the people, picking up the pace. Tombstone glanced over his shoulder and grinned, slipping back into the subway train as its doors closed. Ben growled in frustration and watched the cars slide past, his hand reaching out for the very end of the car and sliding into place behind it. His hands locked down tightly onto the wall and his feet dug into the ground of the tracks, ripping the planks up beneath. The walls at the back of the carriage gave way, and Ben launched forwards on instinct, climbing into the back of the carriage. His body carried him forwards, and he tore down the center of the carriages, gently pushing people out of the way, guttural roars to get people to move as loud as he.

Tombstone, several carriages down, turned to witness Ben tear through the doors, orange colliding with white, the world spinning around them as the doors gave way, the wall of the tunnel entrance ripping apart as their forms collided with it. Tombstone rose first, slamming his foot down onto Ben’s face to stagger him, climbing onto the platform edge and making for the stairs. Ben grabbed a piece of rubble and slowly stood to height. His arm cocked back, and the cement went the distance, colliding with the back of Tombstone’s head and tripping him up the stairs. He kept moving, and Ben followed behind.

---

Tombstone ripped the turnstiles down from their moorings and threw them into the incoming police officers. He tore is shirt from his chest and threw it onto the ground behind him, finding it more of an irritation at this point. He could hear Ben behind him, his footsteps, angered, shaking the floor. He didn’t want to continue this fight, not because he couldn’t hold it, but because it would irritate him greatly, time wasted was time unrecovered. He sauntered onto the street above and looked towards City Hall. No, he needed to be gone. He looked towards a yellow cab and hailed it, ripping the driver, and door, from the vehicle as it pulled up beside him. As he slid into the seat and gunned it, he felt the car’s real wheels lift into the air, and then flip over at the engine. He slid from the vehicle as it did so, turning to face Ben.

“How long can you go?” Ben asked, dropping the vehicle.

“Let’s find out.” Tombstone muttered, ripping a sign from the ground and swinging hard. Ben put up an arm to block it and stepped forwards, right fist swinging. Tombstone dodged and moved closer, shooting for Ben’s chin. Ben took the blow and stepped back. Tombstone reached out, grabbing the taxi and swinging it wide. The body crumpled against Ben and the orange figure flew, his form taking him closer to City Hall. Tombstone ran after him, now determined to put him down. He watched Ben slowly rising back to his feet and grappled him, head beside his chest, pushing him into the wall of City Hall and through it. Ben dug his heels in and slammed both fists down onto Tombstone’s back. Tombstone shrugged it off and lifted his arms, throwing Ben over shoulder and slamming them head first into the ground. He released and slowly rose to height again, brushing dust from his shoulder and turning. He slammed a foot down, keeping Ben pinned to the floor.

“Stay here. It’s not worth the hassle, we both know it.”

Ben roared and grabbed Tombstone by the ankle, and then Tombstone saw only a blur as his body was thrown into the floor and up again, and down again, repeatedly so, until his vision faded to black.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

Ben sat and drank from a bottle of water as SHIELD clamped cuffs around Tombstone’s wrists, pulling him towards the van they had prepared. Maria Hill looked over the top of her sunglasses to Ben and sighed.

“You caused a lot of problems.”

“You think I was gonna grab ‘im without? Lady, I’m a huge orange guy, and this is NYC. Anytime people with powers get involved with one another, there’s chaos. Doom, Nova, that Spider-Kid… What do you expect by now?”

Maria smiled a little and nodded her head. “Good point. I just wanted to say thanks and… If you’re up for it, we could always use another helping hand. There’s always something to do.”

Ben nodded his head and then shook it. “Nah. You guys are too bureaucratic, I gots a lot of family to look after, and the streets need me more than you do.”

Maria flicked her hand out, holding a business card. “Well, then allow me to give you a favour, should you ever need it.”

Ben smiled back, and took the card.

9n7cnw,5,2018-10-11,I have a strange attraction for someone 16 years younger than me.,MattyDoodles,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/9n7cnw/i_have_a_strange_attraction_for_someone_16_years/,"I’m a 39 year old pharmacy tech and have an attraction to a 23yo intern pharmacist.  It’s not really a sexual one, as strange as it sounds.  Now, this girl is a solid 9, first generation German, blond hair and blue eyes, smoking hot body!  Didn’t realize this in the beginning, as she was wearing tons of garb to be in a ultra clean room and 0 makeup.  When I saw her in street clothing I was in an odd way relieved, as I thought she was out of my league.  

It’s her mind I enjoy though.  I enjoy every second I am around her.  Now, I’m married, in an open relationship (wife travels for weeks at times on end and we are SUPER independent people), and my wife fully knows my attraction and thinks it’s “cute”.  There’s no fear of me ever leaving my wife, but there’s also something about this intern that I have never felt.  I feel honestly bad, but life’s odd like that I suppose.

My intern knows I’m married, however, does not know I’m in any sort of open relationship, but has confided that she feels really comfortable around me.  I do not get the feeling that she wants to have sex with me, but also has dropped that she hates her life and has a super dark look at things that I chalk up to being German as fuck.  There’s something there, unspoken, but it’s there.  I fear even attempting to discuss what it is, and she’s mentioned something similar once while really drunk.  It’s strange as I’ve met a bunch of her friends and her parents I’ve seen on Skype and they ask about me.  

Where my wife travels, I have the weekdays to myself.  I’m finding myself hanging out more and more with “K”.  We have super deep conversations, we drink together and are basically killing lots of time in each other’s company.  She works double shifts every weekend, as it’s the only time she has to really work, so it’s really weird as she wants to meet my wife and my wife wants to meet her, but schedules never seem to mesh.  My co-workers have no idea we’re friends, as it’s frowned upon to mingle with interns in my position.  I have 0 power over her, just not seen as “professional”. 

I want to confide that I’m not in a traditional marriage, not to have sex with her, but simply to not be hiding this.  It’s been months that we have been friends and hanging out.  I have no desire to ruin whatever it is that we have.  It’s like nothing I’ve felt with another person.  Yes, I know, strange.  I tell my wife and she’s not mad, actually she rips on me a bit.

Do I keep it under wraps that I’ve hidden a large chunk of who I am to someone or just not say anything, as we are not in any type of “romantic” relationship?  I feel that either she will see me as a creep or think we’re good to fuck, neither of which I want.

I’m kinda thinking of just letting her know and let the chips fall where they fall.

Industries across the globe are funnelling money and resources into the research and development of Blockchain technology. Blockchain technology allows people to make transactions of value directly to one another without the need of a middleman. Every kind of asset, from money to music, can be stored, moved, transacted, exchanged, and managed all without the need for intermediaries. Blockchain technology even has the power to improve the accounting industries and supply society with a higher level of trust in the financials of all companies. Blockchain technology has the power to create a technological revolution. Mainly, blockchain is using for storing data, using as a token and also work as a smart contract. So that we can expect that it will rule over the world like as a backbone of the Cryptocurrency is also known as Bitcoin Currency . Blockchain technology explained, we are making a chain of continues transactions. The main advantage of the blockchain technology is that, it’s using a peer to peer Bitcoin exchange. According to this technology, there is no need for a centralized ledger. Here we are using a distributed ledger. So that any hacker try to delete a transaction, it will not possible. Because each and every transaction of blockchain will make an auto update to all the system immediately. So when a transaction is written in a distributed ledger, it will be locked with previous block hash code. Here there is no centralized system to control, so to do that we are using a proof of work. It will ensure that the entered transaction will not be altered. So we can ensure that our data is  protected. Also we can access them by private key and public key. The public key work as our identity or address the private key will work as our password. So when a transaction occurred, it will be verified by some workers called miners. They will enter the transaction into public ledger and complete the transaction procedure. A group of completed transaction will make a block and it will join to the chain of the block.

**Long Version of My Story**

In late 2011 I was diagnosed with the stage 3 kidney cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in NYC. My team of doctor's was great and they were to able to outright remove 100% of the cancer cells along with my left kidney, which miraurosly had not metastasized to other areas despite being the size of a grapefruit. This was quite a relief after being told at the age of 27 I only had one year left to live.

&amp;#x200B;

While I may have physically healed, every day since that initial diagnosis call has taken a mental toll of my life. I was diagnosed with treatment resistant major depressive disorder and anxiety almost immediately after my diagnosis,which included occasional debilitating panic attacks. I was placed on antidepressants which worked for a time, and I restarted my senior year at Monmouth University in NJ, where my grades had slipped a bit to a 3.95 GPA. I was fortunate enough to win several scholarships, earn a summer internship, and was ultimately offered full time employment out of school. For four years, all was relatively fine, bit then a series of unfortunate events accumulated.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandfather, who was the father figure in my life and raised me a child, passed away quite suddenly due to metastatic melanoma skin cancer, I moved from my childhood home, my loving pet of 17-years passed away, and the engine in my car died with Toyota denying the warranty claim despite their own technician measuring the proper amount of oil within the engine upon draining the fluids; hiring a layer went nowhere because Toyota is a massive corporation with hundreds of lawyers on retainer and they strong-armed me. This single event cost me $9,000 in cash and to top it all off I was recently laid off at the time. Today, my total debt sits at approximately $60,000.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these events combined with the beginning of an extremely stressful accounting busy season where I was responsible to get my own work down, review the work of one to three staff accountants for each of my six different clients, and also correct mistakes on my work as it was reviewed by more senior associates, simply caused something to let go within me. I suffered from multiple panic attacks and I was unable to lead my audit teams and remain the day-to-day point person for up to 8 clients at any given one. On June 1, 2016, I woke up with a severe panic attack, and literally dozens of appointments later, I'v made little progress towards healing and have not been back to work since.

My private disability insurance program purchased through my employer expires August, 2019, and without that I will likely end up declaring bankruptcy at the age of 34."

9n946u,19,2018-10-11,"I stalked my ex a couple of years ago and I still have bad habbits from it, even though I am over her. It makes me feel weird and stupid.",Weird_bad_habbits,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9n946u/i_stalked_my_ex_a_couple_of_years_ago_and_i_still/,"[Remorse]

Wall of text incoming, sorry for that.

So a couple of years ago, I was in a relationship with this girl. We were both in college. I study Psychology. We were very attracted to each other and spent most of our relationship with having sex. We didn't have much in common when it comes to character, but since we were sexually compatible, it didn't really matter to me at that time. I didn't care that I hated her shallow girlfriends and I ignored that she was shallow in some ways, as well.  

However, after one and a half year of going that way, I fell in a depression because of problems with my studies. Basicly my boss during an internship told me I don't have the social capabilities to become a Psychologist, which had been my plan all along. I became insecure and lost my mojo. I felt like shit. My ex distanced herself from me during that time. The internship was supposed to go for 5 months, however I got released after 4 weeks. One week after that, my girlfriend broke up with me and ""confessed"" that she cheated on me twice with a collegue from her part-time job. She could have spared me that news, I guess.

Deep down I always knew that she wasn't ""the one"" for me. I was never jealous or controlling during the relationship and I think I was a decent boyfriend overall. It was a good run while it lasted. In a somewhat stable set of mind, I could have taken the breakup and even the cheating pretty well. 

However, I was everything but stable at that time. My life felt like shit due to the failures both in my study and my love life. I hated myself. I tried to cope with my situation, but I couldn't challenge my anxieties regarding my professional future. So I did what I was able to do: Focussing my attention towards my mean, cheating ex-girlfriend. Every time I tried to challenge my issues with my studies, a wave of guilt, fear and other shitty emotions came over me. 

So instead I thought about my ex and convinced myself that I had to get her out of my system first or something like that. I don't really know what I was trying to do to be honest. I would ride my bike past her house her house and try not to give a shit, as like this would prove something. Once I opened the valves of her bike standing in front of her house to get my ""revenge"". Her neighbour saw me doing it and told her, so that ended in a rather embarrassing way. At least I didn't do serious stuff (e.g. in a better moment I deleted all nude films and pictures of her), but the things I did were pretty fucked up and pathetic in my book, anyway. 

The worst about my behaviour were my constant thought loops around her. Thoughts of getting her back, thoughts of what I did wrong, thoughts of what I should have done differently, thoughts about how I should have reacted when she confessed that she cheated (due to low self-esteem I reacted like a little bitch and tried to be understanding). Those thought loops would constantly come back in my head. 

Fast forward 3 years. In the mean time, I had testicle cancer and I beat it. I followed groups therapy, which helped a lot. I worked for a year in a nursing service company to get rhythm and confidence back. I have a great girlfriend I connect with on both sexual and emotional levels and that I love. A couple of months ago I started a new master study with another specialisation in Psychology. I am doing much better than I used to. However, some thought loops about my ex come back to me whenever I feel pressure in my study. It seems like I still have these coping mechanisms in those situations and it really sucks. It makes me remind of those days where I had no self-esteem, constant fear and acted like a little pathetic bitch. I don't want that. I don't give a shit about my ex. I just want to be productive in my study, but this shit is still somehow in my system. 

I hope my post was somewhat clear, English ain't my native language. I just wanted to write all this crap down, maybe it helps a bit.

9n96zm,2,2018-10-11,I haven't even begun working and I'm already sick of it,cesnoixdejoie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9n96zm/i_havent_even_begun_working_and_im_already_sick/,"I have recently graduated from doing a masters and I am currently searching for jobs, but I am becoming extremely frustrated. I realise it takes a while to find a ""real job"", so I want to explain why I'm not becoming too fatalistic too soon.

About two years ago, I graduated a semester early from my undergraduate degree in history (specifically of a current superpower) at a global top-20 uni (not trying to be braggadocious). I had decided to do history since it was what I was generally interested in. I had considered a science, but I thought they were too specialised for my taste and I was not attracted by the prospect of having to compete with my classmates all the time. In history, I could do my readings, do my research, and not have to worry about outperforming everyone else or being outperformed. 

I thought my uni's name recognition and my decent marks would go a long way in the job application process. After a month or two, it seemed pretty dismal, but I kept applying and applying and applying. I did multiple cover letters a week, and tried to do everything I was told to be successful. I attended multiple job fairs, tailored every single cover letter to the application I was doing, and contacted people I knew at these companies.

After nine months, nothing had turned up, and each week I received dozens of emails with the same text: ""Due to the number of applications, we cannot provide you with specific feedback, but we will not be taking your application further"", or some variation thereupon. I felt extremely impotent and as if I had no control over my life. Here I was, graduated from a great school, and I couldn't even get a job as a supply teacher (partly because I'm an American and my degree was from a Canadian uni, which is a stupid-as-hell reason).

I was absolutely tired of everyone saying to me I just had to wait it out and eventually something would turn up. I was and still am entirely unenthused at the prospect of spending my twenties not having fun, and worrying constantly that if I'm not on LinkedIn every two seconds, I'll miss the one opportunity I'll be a shoe-in for. It seemed as well as if none of the work I had done in my undergrad mattered, unless I could turn it into money immediately. ""Research skills? What are you going to do with that? Good writing skills? Not enough. Oh you speak a few languages but not at a fully native level? Meh."" And so on.

So there I was, working in retail until something better turned up. I had done applications for masters programmes, because it had been beaten into my head constantly that ""It doesn't matter where you do your undergrad; it matters more where you did your masters"". I genuinely enjoy constant study anyway, and thought it would be a good idea to apply earnestly in case I didn't get a stellar job. 

I get accepted to a masters programme across the pond, at a top-ten school this time. I think, ""This time, it'll work out because I have jumped through the hoops everyone expects me to"". I do my masters in political science, focusing on the same country I studied in history. I can't go online without seeing articles that my home country's government has shortages of experts on this country, so I am emboldened in my choice. I do my thesis on a very pressing international issue in which the country of study has been heavily involved. I go to all the faculty job fairs, the careers centre, etc. and always follow their advice. I do multiple applications a week.

And still, I am having zero luck. 

The real point of this post rests in this: I would not be quite so annoyed at the constant refusals if they were from jobs I actually wanted to do. But I am depressed by the fact that I'm getting refused by jobs that seem so utterly pointless and dreary, but seem to be the only choices.

I can't go on LinkedIn or Indeed without positively cringing at every job description. Everything has become so overglorified and overeuphemised that you're not really sure what you're getting into. One application for a ""Customer Experience Facilitator"" at a museum I really like was really only a receptionist job. I had one interview for a ""Marketing Internship"" I applied for, and after an hour of assessments and interviews on location, the interviewer dropped the question, ""So how do you feel about going door to door?"" That's not marketing, sir. And there was the interview I had at a management consultancy, at which they pontificated about the healthy work-life balance (which everyone claims to have until you begin working there), and the almost righteous self-satisfaction one gets from making phone calls to snoop on other companies and determine how much they're paying their own employees. 

The worst thing about that last interview was the interviewer's recommendation that I treat interviews as if I were interviewing the company. I understand the value of getting a grip on the corporate culture before one enters the door, but the insinuation that I have as much power in the situation as he did was extremely offensive. He gets off on a bad foot with me, and I probably have to take the job so I don't become inundated in student loans. I get off on a bad foot with him? I receive a generic email saying I ""wasn't a good fit for the role"". I lose either way.

And the pointlessness comes from the fact that I am going to be expected to respond to emails off the clock, commute hours daily, lose sleep over stockholder value, and work overtime for no extra pay just so that I can eke out an existence and have no time for anything I actually enjoy. I don't want to sit round all day poring over numbers and constantly fearing being fired (muh labour flexibility) if I screw up one report, and chatting with one-sided people whose only concern is making someone else money and taking it up the rear from corporate. I spend my time drawing, reading, learning, going on walks, and playing football. But to get my silly pieces of paper that give me the privilege of eating, I have to forgo all of that. I have to shed my personality and interests to become this one-dimensional, money-crazed, overly competitive person who only cares about work even before I get hired.

In order even to get in the door for an interview, I have to do dozens of assessments and tests after I've already spent time doing cover letters. So if I mess up one thing, there's someone else who hasn't, and is seemingly more qualified by default. 

What I've learnt, since finishing my undergraduate degree, is that you should only follow your passion if no one is asking you ""and what are you going to do with that?"". You should only follow your passion if you can make money off of it the moment you have your diploma in hand. Otherwise, you'll feel like you're Randy Marsh playing Heroin Hero, injecting yourself with more and more skills and information but never catching the dragon of employment. Even if you do find employment involving the thing you are interested in, you'll be sorely underpaid and in constant financial uncertainty. I am *not* throwing shade on people who are genuinely interested in STEM, finance, etc., but if your passion is something else, it's tough friggin luck for you, no matter how useful it initially seems,how well you do it, or how good your credentials are. 

I haven't even begun my career and I already just want to be left alone.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"
9nad7m,3,2018-10-11,I'm lost and don't understand what's wrong with me.,JumpyJess,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9nad7m/im_lost_and_dont_understand_whats_wrong_with_me/,"Hey there, if this is not the right subreddit, please let me know. I'm at a point where I'm completely lost and need some feedback, and figured reddit might be of help. 

I'll try to shortly sketch my situation. I've always been a very insecure person, and  bullying experiences obviously did not do me any good. I'm now 24 years old and studying to be nurse (which I am very passionate about). I have these days where for no reason I am extremely down on myself. I have zero controle over my emotions and everything around me is negative. It feels negative. The slightest remark can throw me completely off balance. And I hate to lose this control. At those times I am not kind to those around which I always regret when I come to my senses. On the contrary I also have days where I'm very inspired, creative and optimistic. Those kind of days happen at randomly. This week I started my first internship for school to learn some basics of the job as a nurse. I started early this morning and every mistake I made got pointed out (obviously, since I have to learn and get feedback). I felt my throat tighten up and tears coming up and tried to surpress this. The nurse guiding me noticed my eyes were red and told me to not pannick, this made it worse. I had to breath in and out a few times to get to my senses. But throughout the whole day this never got better. I felt extremely sensitive for everything around me, the slightes remark, or look threw me off. I felt so insecure and lost without any control of my emotions. I held my tears in for the rest of the day but was constantly on the break of crying. Untill my shift almost ended. I had to write a selfreflection and completely crashed. I started sweating heavily and crying and sobbing. My breathing was unsteady and I just couldn't calm down. Everyone was so suprised and I felt so ashamed. People were comforting me saying, you can make mistakes, you'll learn and grow etc.. But those words did not calm me down. When I walked home I cried even more, I have completely lost control of my emotions and this makes me so angry. I'm afraid this will start interfering with future work too.. I'm lost. Is this all due to my insecurity? am I depressed or something? fear of failing? anxiety? Does anyone else have this feeling? "
9nb0xb,1,2018-10-11,I'm No Longer Sure? And I need to Get it Out...,squishiebutt2020,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/9nb0xb/im_no_longer_sure_and_i_need_to_get_it_out/,"Yesterday I posted about wanting to cancel my T appt. It got me thinking all night again about it. I want to physically be a man. I feel like I am a better man than a woman. It feels right going into the man's bathroom, to have muscles and pee standing up. But I worry about what others think. I'm very self conscious on what others think of me. Especially my family. Everyone at school already sees me as a man. They're ok with it. It's just a simple ok sure move on. My family is my everything. They are the only people I've ever socialized with. I wasn't socialized as a child/teen; we stayed home. I had a drunk as a father and so we didn't invite friends over, plus I didn't have many or any. I was terribly shy, still am. My family is very strict conservatives. Ultra right...won't even watch a tv program with a ""muslim"" on it that's a regular main character. Their all ISIS and crap. Transwomen are disgusting and Transmen are fake and ignorant. How can one go against God. Bullshit. I'm 35 I've grown up around this. I'm a feminist, I'm a democrat, I'm ok with immigrants, I'm ok with muslims and hispanics. I'm educated about the economy, politics...they aren't. They listen to Fox ""news"" and keep their opinions that are stated on TV and yet they use government help like Republicans created it and wanted them to flourish Morons! I cause arguments a lot in my family because I know what's real. I try not to see my family a lot. I can't stand them to listen to them, love them dearly. Enjoy spending time with them, but I can't stand to listen to politics or anything news related with them. They know me as being bisexual or literally came out once never had a girlfriend and ended up with a man. So they think probably it was just a phase. But they're fine with it. I joke with my uncles about cute women when we're together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I graduate college May 2020 and have to stay in my current city for at least two years because I am getting my education from a specific company who's footing the bill so I have to give back to them for at least 2 years. Fine. I am from Austin, TX. I want to live in Dallas or Houston, TX. Austin is great it's just too expensive to live. Property taxes are almost $10,000 for a $300,000 home. I can't afford that. I don't want to afford that. In outskirts which is where I live is $4000 for a $100,000 home yearly. That's way too much. Then you have the electric company that is used and they are extremely expensive. It's just too costly to live in and around Austin, TX in my opinion. Plus, I want to live near water. Sure Lake Travis is great, but I want to really live in Houston, TX where I can watch the shipping channels and see BIG boats. So I see myself moving to where I can do that. Once I'm out of my mom's house I know I can do what I want. My boyfriend says he's ok with me transitioning. He's says he's all for it. I know he likes guys. So I believe him. He swears he won't be leaving me. Now my mom says he's lying to me cuz he wants to be supportive, but he's truly not. Which makes me doubt him. I will be 37+ when I move out not too old to not go through transitioning. I will have top surgery. I want bottom surgery. I'll make enough money to where I can afford it. I'm going into a great field... IT. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't necessarily have dysphoria over being a woman. The main thing for me is I don't have a penis and I have breasts. If I could cut them off, I would and just be done with it. I can't afford top surgery right now. No income and horrible credit so can't go that route either. So I just have to wait. Which is hard because in my bedroom I am always shirtless and I want to be shirtless all the time. I don't like clothes touching my upper body. But my family is against that lol. I'm against it with them around. When my boyfriend and I lived on our own I walked around topless all the time. Lost job had to move back home. My boyfriend can't afford an apartment on his own and he makes over $15/hr. and works full time. So we have to deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if I'm a trans man, non-binary, female, alien? I'm confused. And there's no one to talk to about this. Everyone I talk too is either just reiterating what I say (my boyfriend) or tells me I'm wrong (family). There's no one else. I'm seeing a school counselor for anxiety and cognitive behavioral therapy, but I don't really feel comfortable talking about my gender issues with her. I mean she's asked me if I want too and I just don't feel comfortable telling her how I feel. It's weird. It causes me anxiety and that's why I'm going to her is for anxiety so I might just bite the bullet this next appointment and bring it up. I'm supposed to be talking about what all is causing me to have anxiety so I might as well talk about it. Maybe it'll help. I told my mom about my T appt. yesterday, I was trying to keep it secret and I blabbed because I wanted her opinion and I'm stupid cuz I know her opinion. Of course she doesn't understand and she doesn't want me to do it. Why would I think she'd be ok with it or even supportive. Dummy me. So now she knows and is like ""oh dear Please God don't let my baby get on Testosterone."" she has panic attacks about shit like that. Like it's my life woman. She has panic attacks cuz she can't control me. That's all. She knows I'm my own person and I'm not about to listen to bullshit and I'm gonna do it my way, so she has panic attacks to keep me from doing what I want. Because then I'll feel guilty and not do what I want. Hell she's the reason I left my paid internship. Kept taking her blood pressure pill and falling out and she didn't need it the whole time. Within two days of me quitting my internship she was no longer having what looked like strokes. Like woman did that shit on purpose. I've found a better internship and hoping to get it next semester, but then I wonder then what is she and my grandpa gonna do to get me to quit it. I have to be home and take care of them and do their things for them. Like my grandpa is 81 years old he needs to be in a home, but refuses. He's slightly senile remembers things from the 80s but not too recent. Eats peanut butter and jelly sandwiches cuz he doesn't cook and won't buy food. Goes out to eat. Lives on 1200 a month and is always broke and he don't have bills. He lives in a travel trailer and his bills are literally $400 a month. With the rest I don't know where it goes, but he's never with money and has to cancel his doctor appts. all the time and can't pay for his oxygen. So I have too. I have to go with him to all his doc appts cuz he doesn't understand them, doesn't write very well so can't sign in. Oh but he can drive. Literally, my family is guilting me into doing things I don't want to do. Because I know medical terminology I have to be at all doc appts cuz I understand doc speak. Like tell them you want to hear in plain English /laymans terms and they will tell you. There's literally a word for it. It's not that hard. But I have to take time off from school, work, homework, life and deal with this shit. I want to leave. I'm tired of it. It causes me anxiety. Boy I'm making my family out to be horrible. They kind of are. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just need to graduate and get out. Only call and see them once a year...if that. Just live my life with my boyfriend and be happy together however we decide to live."
9nb6zf,3,2018-10-11,I have a marketing degree but I'm interested in computer science?,thestefman7,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/9nb6zf/i_have_a_marketing_degree_but_im_interested_in/,"Long story short: I went against my gut to study computers because I had no confidence in my own ability. I did a marketing communications program because our professors were pushing it as a new program at the school and because ""it's very versatile."" Now I find myself with a degree that I don't really like. I'm mostly just qualified to do sales jobs or becoming a content writer, neither of which I really like. However, I do like the business management side of marketing, and I could use it in that sense. My only real work experience is writing web content and social media as an intern. I made some html edits as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought about going back to school but I know very little about computer science now. I know html/css and some javascript, but I'm definitely not a true programmer. I have lots of small knowledge gaps as to how tech all works together. I really only understand the languages themselves (the ones I know). 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I get a job and go back to school later? What kind of career? I love the tech industry. I would be happy as a developer or just someone who gets to work in the management side of a tech company. I really don't like sales. Small talk/ schmoozing, whatever you want to call it is the complete opposite of my personality. I like working on projects, thinking strategically and problem solving. I really just need some direction in life. Thanks."
9nb7g6,52,2018-10-11,I left my qualifier.,kalliasolti28,AlAnon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/9nb7g6/i_left_my_qualifier/,"Hi all,

i've posted here before, but finally have an update on my situation.

A couple months ago, my ex and I broke up due to what ended up being his relapse. About a month after our first breakup we got back together again when, admittedly, I wasn't ready. I still felt betrayed by him hiding his addiction and relapse from me. We had gotten together on the condition that there we would be open and honest with each other and that he would be focused on his recovery, I now realize this was naive of me. A couple weeks into us dating again, everything came to a head. He decided he wanted to go visit a ""friend"" in another country who he would be staying with and claimed she was gay because she had apparently dated girls throughout college. Unfortunately, I knew said friend and she had been dating a guy all throughout college, and from what I knew, had just broken up with him a couple months prior. I confronted him about this , telling him that I was only angry because he had lied to me when we had gotten back together on condition that we would be honest with each other and he became irate, said that I was making this up, that I was insecure, and that he had lied to me to ""protect me"". I had finally had enough and ended things there. The week after, I found out he had been cheating on me when he relapsed, and had been doing more than just cocaine again.

It wasn't easy, he was my best friend and my only support system in this new state. Apart from that, I loved him. For a long time I would've done absolutely anything for him, but as time passed  he had become emotionally abusive, manipulative and left me feeling like I had to be walking on eggshells 24/7. I didn't realize how emotionally draining being with him was until I left, I rationalized his behaviors to myself, and stayed with him because I was both afraid to be alone, and waiting for him to ""get better"". I lied to my friends, family and even therapist about the state of our relationship because I was afraid of admitting to myself that what we had had become toxic, but I've since learned to put myself first and listen to my gut.

Since i've left i've made friends, i've explored nearby states, i've welcomed new opportunities and have excelled in classes, forming close bonds with faculty at the university. I graduate college this upcoming spring and am working in a lab and am now looking to intern abroad and looking at graduate school programs all around the U.S. I dealt with a lot of guilt for the first couple months but after attending al-anon regularly have realized that I am not to blame for what happened.

I am no-contact with my ex, but I truly hope that he is able to recover and is in a better place now than before. I have no regrets about moving here or being with him, I feel as though i've learned a lot from being with him and am thankful for the good times we had.

anywho, I just wanted to share my story. if anyone has had any similar situations, feel free to talk to me!"
9nd2nq,5,2018-10-11,I cursed out my mom out of anger and frustration,hamilton44fan,Anger,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/9nd2nq/i_cursed_out_my_mom_out_of_anger_and_frustration/,"Im having another rough semester. My GPA isn’t the best to begin with and I was barely passing two classes so it was going to drop even further. No matter how hard I tried (going to every class, I kept failing on my midterms in two of my classes that is.

Last Friday after getting two D’s on midterms finally I’d just had enough. I yelled and cursed in the air repeatedly. When I got back to my dorm room I banged the door, threw my backpack down on the ground and kicked it numerous times against the wall.

​

This is my phone conversation with my mother:

Me: Where are you?! Are you on your way?! I need to talk to you about something.

Mom: I just left. Whats up?!

Me: What do you mean you just left?! You’re supposed to have left like 30 minutes ago. What the fuck is taking so long?!

Mom: I was at work Steven. Is there that you'd like to talk about?!

Me: “You can’t be this fucking self-absorbed to put your laptop down for one second to realize that you have to come pick me up?! We could have been on our way back home by now. Hurry the fuck up and get your fucking ass over here.

Mom: Steven calm down. 

Me: What do you mean calm down?! I’m so sick and tired of dealing with fucking idiots like you who can’t even be bothered to show up on time because they don’t even have the common sense to check the clock on their god damn computers. See this is why I need to get my own car that way I don’t have to wait for you all the time. Life would be so much fucking easier. 

Mom: Ok Steven I'm going to ask you one more time. Whats going on?!

Me: I'm struggling in my classes yet again this semester. It just seems like no matter what I do, it never seems to work. I'm so fucking tired of this shit. I'm just gonna drop out of school and take out loans. Maybe I should just jump into the Kiskwaukee River and end it once and for all. I'm so fucking done with life.

Mom: You're gonna kill yourself just because you're doing bad in a few classes?!

Me: Do you fucking not get it? I'm studying accounting with the hopes of getting a job after graduation. I need a 3.0 GPA in order to get internships. Right now my GPA is 2.8 and with the way classes are going, its gonna drop to a 2.6.

Mom: Steve I'll see you when I get to NIU we'll talk more. I'm in the middle of a construction zone. Hangs up the phone.

I continue kicking my backpack around and punching my pillow cursing and screaming rages.

Anyway, my mom is upset with me over my verbal tirade with her and wants me to apologize.

Obviously internships are valuable, so I was wondering if I should just get an internship in the software development side (corresponding to my major) for next summer and continue spending my free time building my reel, so that in the years after I would be able to get a vfx internship. Or would it be more worth my while to wait until I get a vfx internship and focus more time on honing my modeling and effects skills? Or is there a different option that you would recommend? Thanks for any and all advice, I really appreciate it."
9nfbjd,25,2018-10-11,My life is garbage even when I'm TRYING to make a change.,Waldoz53,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/9nfbjd/my_life_is_garbage_even_when_im_trying_to_make_a/,"About a year ago, I got tired of my NEET life. I was sitting around eating pizza, watching TV shows, watching movies in theaters that serve you food, but mostly just playing video games. It was kinda great, even if I was super depressed and lonely deep down.

But it kinda got boring. Things got a little bit frustrating sometimes. It's an insane first world problem, but it really did boil down to shit like my favorite pizza place frequently and randomly being closed, and me moving to a completely different area where movie theaters that serve you food aren't even a thing. Sacrilege!!

I eventually found a program at my college that was far more interesting to me than any other course or program I've ever taken. I loved the course. It was more fun than I have ever had at a regular university, while also making me work my ass off. But when it came down to the main reason I picked it? 83% of the programs graduates earn $50,000 a year. Since I was no longer eating pizza all the time and spending money on movie theater beer and burgers or buying any video game on a sale, $50k is insane. I live with my parents now too, so I'd never have to worry about paying for internet, phone and whatever else until I wanted to live alone.

I've been lonely and sad and tired and fat for years now. I thought by taking this program, graduating, and getting a job, I'd be on my way to fixing my problems. I've never been so happy after finishing a college program. I didn't make friends in class because I'm terrible, horribly ultra shy, but I had a crush in class I actually spoke to a few times(!!). I was on my way up, my self esteem was through the roof (compared to what it's been for years). I just bought a treadmill and dumbbells so I can get back into some sort of shape. I was going to monthly meetups so I can network with other people who are in my line of work. I loved those meetups almost entirely because the bartenders are incredibly attractive but I still went with the intention of networking.

But nothing has changed much. I'm still fat (although I did JUST get a treadmill and dumbbells). I'm still friendless. I'm still incredibly lonely. I can't find a job. The obvious reason is that I have no real experience, which makes sense, but even my schools stupid 2 month internships that pop up, the companies that are paying $0 for 2 months of work don't want me.

I had an interview 3 weeks ago with one of those companies, again. I felt really good after the interview. I got a messaged on LinkedIn from a guy in my class who works there, and he told me that I did really well and was on the shortlist. But I got nothing. It's been months of this garbage. Interview where I feel I did well, but I never get the position. It's just over and over and over again over the last few months. Even those 2 month unpaid internships don't want me. I'm putting myself out there trying to get a job, and money, so I can make my garbage life better. I want money and I want a job so I don't become this fat slob that is proud of doing nothing all day. The money and job will give me access to going out and meeting people, making friends, hell even landing a date. I don't have much money and I'm struggling to get any interview, and when I do get an interview I just get ignored out of the gate. So many jobs here are ""entry level"" but require 3-5 years of experience, while a senior developer requires 5+ years of experience. I've been told my resume and cover letters look great. I've been told I nail interviews. All this stuff just means nothing when I'm just getting nothing out of it.

I'm tired of being sad and lonely and fat. I wanted a job so I can move on with my life. I **still** am madly in love with someone who will never, ever be with me, but I can't move on if I don't have what I need to move on. My self esteem is back to its garbage non-existence like it has been for the last 30000 years. I want to break down and cry, but I can't. I have no one to talk to about this. I'm desperate for a stupid unpaid job, just so I can get experience, just so I **can** get a paid job. All so I can make friends, meet new friends, and meet people to date. While I'd be working, I was going to work on losing weight, and doing different hobbies. But its soul crushing. How can my self esteem be WORSE than it was a year ago?

All my effort over the last year is coming down to absolutely nothing. I want a change, and have been working for a change, but I've got fucking nothing to show for it. I can't even cry, because I'm just tired. I want to just lay down and get absorbed into the ground. That's what I want now. Sure, I can still lose weight, and sure it'll feel good to lose weight. Sure, I can get a job at some fast food place, and I'll have a little bit of money there but I SPECIFICALLY want a job in front-end/full stack/web development, but not one company wants me.

I was told that if I was unhappy with something in my life, I should change it. I did change it, or tried to. Instead I'm at the exact same spot I was a year ago."
9nffcl,2,2018-10-11,For those in and out of school - How is your sleep?,mediocrekids,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/9nffcl/for_those_in_and_out_of_school_how_is_your_sleep/,"I've been out of education for a couple of months now (left sixth form in England and am currently in an internship 1 day a week) and I was thinking about the sleep I've been getting recently and just my mental health in general since I left. 

I'm not one to really go on about mental health and to self-diagnose and all that. Whether detrimental or not I tend to just deal with things myself but I really have found that I had a deep hatred for the system of education itself (more so than the individual lessons) and that that took an observable tole on me while I was in there.

It's come as a surprise to me then that for every ""night"" (I'll get to that later) for the past 2 weeks or so I've been having dreams which I way less frequently did while I was in sixth form and my quality of sleep has greatly improved. In the later stages of college once it came to A-Level Exams and all that I developed an absolutely racing train of thought and when trying to sleep at night I'd lie for what seemed like forever trying to fall asleep eventually conjuring a sort of meditation-like technique to just help me fall asleep.

I don't fall asleep at the drop of a hat now but I'd say I drift of at a reasonable rate since all of the things plaguing my mind have subsided and that I can sort of sleep when I want to (I have chosen the incredibly unreasonable 6-9am hours to go to sleep now) and sometimes go to my internship tired if I can't adjust the sleep schedule within the week. Now I feel much better.

It might have been that, at least at the moment, I'm a night owl, it may have just been my dumb reason to stay in education (I wasn't really invested in it) or the general stress thinking about everything causes (apparently sixth form is harder than university) but out of college I feel miles better.

My question to the subreddit then is what has being in/out of education been like for you guys in terms of rest? Is there a difference for you? Any tips or tricks for others? Etc.

I wore skirts and pastels and cute dresses until I was 11, and at a party with my parents, some old guy lifted up my skirt and started touching my butt. He put his fingers into my underwear, on the side, and I was just frozen in place. He stopped soon, and eventually my parents' friend saw him weirdly near me and like dragged me away. When I told her what happened, she said it was bad and not to let him do it again, but didn't do anything else, and I was too ashamed to tell my parents.

After that, I stopped dressing femininely and cut my hair to a pixie cut, and my self esteem dropped to literally rock bottom, and I was just anxious and depressed all time time. I didn't start growing my hair out until junior year of high school, and didn't wear a skirt until like six months ago.

These six months since I was accepted into a great college have been incredible, and my mental health and confidence have skyrocketed. Now, I take good care of my skin, hair, and wear nice clothes, and honestly I can say that I'm really freaking pretty. I feel good, I have a super sweet partner who thinks I'm the cutest person in the world, and I'm not afraid of showing feminity anymore. Moving here, I'd felt completely confident in myself and what I was bringing to the table in my field.

I've lived in rural (my parents are agriculture scientists) and suburban areas my entire life, and I just moved to a major city for school and an internship last month. I've travelled globally and have spent a lot of time in cities, so I thought I'd be pretty prepared, but it's so much harder than I thought.

My second day here, I was walking down the street and these kids threw soda on me and called me a racial slur. A few days later I was walking to my internship and some grown man starts yelling at me, also calling me a racial slur. Living in rural areas, I'd never experienced catcalling before, but now it happens almost fucking daily. I have really big breasts (that I used to hate and wore a binder everyday to cover) and am generally curvy even though I'm really small and short (5'3""), and I've never had to deal with people looking at me like this and it makes me want to fucking die. People think it's just okay to treat me, a stranger, like a sexual object, and I never understood that this is the way the world works.

The breaking point was when I was walking to work today and some grown man came up behind me, leaned over me, and fucking *smelled me*. I've felt gross and unsafe all day. Living here makes me anxious everywhere I go, I just feel so vulnerable and scared and I almost feel that people can tell how vulnerable I am on the street. Like, I'm 18 and alone, physically weak, and I just want to feel like a fucking person and not a target. I was taught to be friendly and helpful to people, and my whole life I lived in a small welcoming community, but now that feels like opening myself up to attack.

Is this what it's like to be a girl? It makes me feel so fucking bad, I don't know how to get used to this. Sorry for the rant, I just don't know what to do or how to get used to this."
9nfmbw,17,2018-10-11,I think he's into me and I'm going insane,throwaway10112018,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/9nfmbw/i_think_hes_into_me_and_im_going_insane/,"Context: I'm 21y/o in college away from campus for an internship for the semester, the other guy is 19 and goes to the same school.

Recently I joined my school's esport organization and was put on a competitive team. I met him through the team and a mutual interest in video games and such. We hit it off extremely quickly as friends, memeing in discord chats and having playful banter. It then started to feel like flirting, so I asked him if he was flirting with me because that's what I've been doing. He says yes, but he's confused about his sexuality since he's only dated girls before.

I leave it at that not wanting to push the issue letting him know he can talk to me (as a friend), but the flirting continues and gets more frequent and public (in public discord servers). Fast forward a few weeks to last night, the team we're on has a venting session about our lives, insecurities, fears, etc. it was very cathartic and bonding. It makes me start to think about how much I really like this guy and want him to know so that I won't regret not telling him in the future.

I write him a lengthy note to him and send it all about how I really like him, but I don't want to suggest anything that he's uncomfortable with and don't want to lose him as a friend. He takes a while to respond and says basically that he feels the same way but ends with "" I’m excited for what will happen when you get back to school I’ll just say that"". Later he sends me verbatim ""Between you and me I'm pretty sure I'm bi :shrug emoji:"" I respond with "" I don’t want to make any decisions for you. I just want to let you know how I feel and now that I know how you feel it’s... a nice feeling really""

I feel both happy and confused at the same time. I know he's unsure of his sexuality and I want to give him space for that, but I don't know where I, my feelings for him, or his feeling for me fit in. I just mostly wanted to get this out there and see if anyone had any insights or take-aways.

Thanks guys, this is always a supportive community :)"

Hello-

I am a senior resident in pediatrics (US Program) who will be starting my second rotation in the Nursery. In my first rotation, as an intern, I performed several circumcisions. However, following a review of the literature and arguments for/against routine neonatal circumcision I have decided that I am not interested in making this a part of my practice.

I am not opposed to parents making that choice and choosing a pediatrician who will perform this. I am also not trying to change anybody's mind nor am I trying to impose my personal choice in this matter on my peers, patients, or anyone else... really. The Nursery rotation includes ""afternoon circ time"" where, following rounds, the circumcisions are divided among residents. The vast majority enjoy the procedure. However, I would really prefer to abstain from doing it.

My major concern is how to approach this with my attendings respectfully. I am afraid that by electing to abstain from performing the procedure I'll be seen as lazy or self-righteous or, worse still, difficult. Even if I had personal concerns or disagreements with the plan, I always try to approach a disagreement from a position of \*how can I learn\* or \*how can I improve my approach\* and- at the end of the day- I will always follow my attending's plan. I'm so anxious about approaching this subject as a resident and I have no idea how to proceed. Do any attendings have any advice?"

9ng16t,16,2018-10-11,My coworker exploded on me today about my anger,dumpstertomato,Anger,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/9ng16t/my_coworker_exploded_on_me_today_about_my_anger/,"It was a pretty big wake up call.  Things have been getting more and more tense between me and a coworker of mine for a while now. They are an intern and we didn’t really mesh since they started about 5 months ago. Lots of petty arguments and frustrations on both ends. But recently I could tell that they were just sooo done with me and getting more and more angry at me. They snapped about a week ago about something very petty and sent me a handful of novel length texts about all the times that I was argumentative and made the workplace toxic. I just agreed with them, because I think that they were right.  I DO argue too much. I DO get upset about things that I think are important, and rant about them. I did feel out of control whenever he would argue with me and get to the point of yelling and crying. I think it is toxic behavior for the workplace. 

Well, after a couple weeks of flat out avoiding the person, I asked if we could try to talk it out and figure out how to proceed. This resulted in us awkwardly standing in a busy hallway at work while he yelled at me for 40 minutes about how much my anger has been toxic for him. How every time someone disagrees with me I yell at them until they take my side. About how my face and eyes become literally red when I’m upset (true, I flush easily). About all the reasons that my disproportionate anger reaction is ruining his life (unhappy time at work caused him to lash out in anger at his gf, and she dumped him).  He got pretty nasty and said some over the line things.  Yes I do see the irony here.  But, it was amazing how much rage he had pent up over my actions. 


This all happened today, and I’m in a very tricky mix of emotions depending on the passing  moment.  I’m angry at him over some of the mischaracterizations he stated over previous discussions, I’m annoyed, wishing he had enough self awareness to see how he played into this situation instead of putting it 100% on me. I’m struggling with shame and despair that comes from accepting that I come across as a much more angry person than I want. I’m anxious that everyone else at work thinks the way he does and hates me. I’m grateful that this came out and hopeful that I can’t learn from it. I’m back to being angry and trying to shift more blame to him.  Then I’m hopeful again. Then I’m in despair thinking that people never ever change. I’m all over the place, just trying to accept my role and move forward with acceptance. 



Before I realized it was really an anger issue, I kept looking up “how to become less argumentative” and just found about 100 articles about “how argumentative people are ruining your life,” “How to deal with angry people,”  “ten reasons why argumentative people are the worst”, etc.
But after he said that I got red faced, I realized that it’s really an anger issue, not just an argument habit. 


Then I found this subreddit, and I’m so grateful. I need practical tools and help, and a little empathy.  Typical internet advice is like. “Just stop.” “Listen more, speak less.” “Just let things go and you won’t be so mad, Kay?” 


But finding a community that posts actual real advice, self help guides, practical techniques, and support is incredible to me.  I’m just so grateful and ready to change. 

Please let me know if you are similar to me (very argumentative, reactive, very quick to debate, etc) and what helped you the most. Therapy is too expensive right now since I don’t have insurance, but self help audiobooks and podcasts would be super helpful. 


Thanks everyone. Sorry, I’m not a great writer, so I don’t normally post stuff like this. I’m just really feeling ready to let go of some bad coping mechanisms that weren’t serving me well, and also just get past this horrible moment I’m living in.

9ngnlb,36,2018-10-11,I almost had my entire identity stolen as the result of a Craigslist housing scam.,i_watched_jane_die,Scams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/9ngnlb/i_almost_had_my_entire_identity_stolen_as_the/,"Not long ago, I moved to Philly and began looking for housing. A few days into my search I came across an option on Craigslist that sounded perfect -- a one-bedroom sublet in the very center of the city (in Chinatown) for $900 a month. It looked like a beautiful apartment and I already had the sense that it was too good to be true, but because I didn't have a good feel for the price of housing in Philly yet and because I am fairly uninitiated in the world of online scamming I decided to go ahead and reply.   
  
I made my first mistake right away. The person replied back with a few additional details about the sublet and ended the email with:    

&gt;I noticed your email address is encrypted. just to be sure am not talking to a bot, please write out your email address to proceed.   
  
I wasn't hip to the scam yet, and the reply had a company email signature complete with social media links and phone numbers, so I went ahead and replied with my email address -- even though, in retrospect, anyone who has used Craigslist should know that this is how it works.    
  
Soon, I received a long email directly from this person. His email address contained his name (let's call him Chad Robertson; it was a fairly generic American-sounding name) and had a profile picture of a guy hiking down a trail. He explained his situation and gave some additional information about the apartment.   
  
&gt;The building is named [NAME] and it is located in the cool China Town neighborhood. The neighborhood is a walkers Paradise, very bike-able and the building location offers easy access to most of life's necessities and activities like festivals, music performances, movies in the park, restaurants, grocery stores, and nearby schools. The apartment building half blocks away from TempleUniversity School of Podiatric Medicine and four blocks away from Hahnemann Hospital. Three blocks to famed Reading Terminal Market and PA Convention Center, and a few blocks to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and University- City Hall and OldCity. Easy to get around with bike, Septa bus, subway, and railway at Jefferson Station.
 
  
This sent up several red flags. For one, ""walker's paradise"" is language taken directly from Walkscore.com. Also, ""famed Reading Terminal Market"" sounds weird and canned; who would describe something as ""famed"" unless they were writing a brochure for tourists? Plus the English seemed dubious coming from someone named Chad Robertson. Anyway, Chad explained that he was subletting his place because he'd be away from Philly for 6 months doing an internship in Baltimore, and he volunteered an acceptance letter from the Baltimore branch of a large corporation, complete with signatures, phone numbers, the name of the company's hiring manager, etc. The letter seemed legit, was professionally formatted, and wasn't written in the peculiar English of the email. So I thought hey, maybe this guy just isn't good at expressing himself...? The email ended with him asking me to tell him about myself, which I stupidly did. I also asked when I'd be able to have a tour of the apartment.   
  
I received another long-winded reply in which Chad continued to volunteer information about himself. He explained that he was Canadian by birth but grew up with family in Illinois and then moved to Philly to study journalism at Temple University. He also sent a couple of pictures of himself, as if they would serve as evidence that everything was on the up-and-up -- and he topped it all off with his Social Security Number. In response to my question about when I would be able to come see the apartment, he replied that he was already in Baltimore and that

&gt;a physical tour of the unit is not possible at the moment due to my absence and I just found out that the building conditions before they can show the unit on my behalf is quite tedious for me right now, they are requesting that I provide an inventory before they can access the unit or show it to anyone on my behalf.

Okay, so if you're not in Philly and they won't let anyone access the apartment on your behalf, then how do you plan on subletting it? At this point I finally admitted to myself that it was some sort of scam but was curious to see what the pitch was, as he hadn't directly asked me for money yet. I replied saying I needed to see more pictures of the apartment if I was going to rent it sight-unseen. He sent back several pictures of a beautiful, luxury one-bedroom apartment which I'm sure could easily be rented out for $1800 or more per month. I should mention that each of Chad's emails contained a signature of the company at which he was supposedly interning, which was stupid -- why would you use a business signature with your personal email address?  
  
Chad also sent over a ""sublet application form,"" which again, looked super official. It asked for my personal information (including my SSN!), rental history, employment history, etc. It stated that I was entitled to a discount on the rent if I paid a certain amount up front (for example, 10% for 2-3 months up front and 20% for 6 months up front). Chad instructed me to fill out the form and then send it to ""Jerry"" and CC him. ""Jerry,"" in turn, would conduct a background check. ""Jerry's"" email address had the domain name of a real property management company that works in Philly and South Jersey and I discovered that there really was a Jerry that worked there. But obviously I didn't fill anything out and didn't send Chad anything else.     
  
I decided to go digging to find out whether Chad Robertson was a real person at all, and after a bit of Googling, I found the real Chad. From what I could gather, the biography the scammer gave me was accurate up to the part about moving to Philly for college -- the real Chad is a journalism undergrad in a different city in a different part of the country. However, the real Chad *did* get a 6-month internship at this company in Baltimore. So in essence, what had happened is that this scammer stole Chad's entire identity, pictures and internship acceptance letter and social security number and all, and is now using it to scam other people in a different city. It's basically the scam version of a Russian nesting doll. My guess is that the real Chad was trying to find housing in Baltimore and ended up getting totally smoked by fake Chad, who now has everything he needs to do serious damage to his credit score, reputation, etc. It also seemed that the scammer had created a fake LinkedIn page for Chad (I found what seems to be Chad's real LinkedIn, but then there was a second one containing a lot of text in broken English and whose location was set as Philadelphia).   
  
I tracked down the real Chad on Facebook and messaged him to let him know his identity was being used to run a housing scam. I forwarded him the emails to give him an idea of how much information had been stolen. He thanked me, but I don't know how it all turned out and if he ended up taking any action.   
  
On one hand, I feel stupid for not realizing right away that this was a scam and simply walking away from it, but on the other hand, I feel like I learned some good lessons. I also feel kind of privileged for having been exposed to such an elaborate scam. I didn't give up any truly sensitive information so I'm holding out hope that the scammer won't turn around and try to scam people using my identity.  
  
The takeaway from all this is that you should never give out more information about yourself than is absolutely necessary, and that you should be very suspicious when someone volunteers excessive amounts of very specific personal information. If the person on the other side of the screen is adamant to prove that they aren't scamming you, they're most likely scamming you. "

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 17, I visited a friend at her college. It was the first time I had ever been to a bar. I had too much to drink, including accepting several shots from a person I had told my friends earlier in the night was giving me the creeps.

&amp;#x200B;

I went back to his dorm room with him and his friends. I had consensual sex with him. However after the first time we had sex, he wanted more, and I allowed it, but after a while it became very painful. I remember telling him that he was hurting me. I remember asking him to stop. But he didn't. And I was 17. This was 2009. Things were different. I was drunk. I let him finish, though I did try to end it by lying my body completely down on the bed and trying to move away from him.

&amp;#x200B;

When he finished, I left. I gathered up my things and managed to call a friend, who had another friend meet me at the dorm to walk me back to her room. I remember walking into the bathroom across the hall from the man's dorm. I remember the blood on my panties. I was not a virgin, but I told him it hurt. It did. There was blood on my underwear.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing ever came from that. I told a friend the next morning that I felt like I may have been raped, that it didn't feel consensual and that I was very upset. But it was 2009, I was 17, and I never should have been at that bar drinking in the first place, it was illegal in the state I was in. I never reported it. I didn't think anyone would believe me.

&amp;#x200B;

6 years later, in 2015, I was working as an intern for a nonprofit organization, my first job out of college. One day, while I was working late on a project, this 40-year-old man who was an employee for the company approached me and another intern (who was a man) and suggested we all go out for drinks. Myself and the other intern declined, we couldn't really afford to do that sort of thing in the city we were in. But the employee offered to pay, he suggested a place around the corner, so we went. I was 22.

&amp;#x200B;

That night, I had too much to drink too fast. I remember drinking whiskey at the bar, and then, waking up naked in my bed in the apartment I lived in with my mom with a used condom under me. I had no idea what had happened, but I never slept naked and my phone was missing. I immediately told my mom what happened and that my phone was missing. We used find my iPhone to track it down.

&amp;#x200B;

The employee had it. I met with him that morning and he gave it to me. When I asked him what happened, he told me that I had fallen asleep both at the bartop upstairs and on a bench in the downstairs portion of the bar. He said a bartender had approached him and the other intern, told them I was too intoxicated to be there, and told them to take me home. It was April in the northeast. The coat I was wearing that night was covered in vomit. I had a huge welt on the back of my head that I can only assume was from falling down too hard when I passed out. It hurt to wash my hair for weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I still didn't know where the condom came from. I asked the doormen in my building to show me the surveillance footage from that night. In the video, you can see me, swaying, with my scarf dragging along the floor, fumbling my way into the building, with the employee following me.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I had not reported it the first time, and because I felt so sure that a 40-year-old employee should not be around so many young female interns given a situation like this, I did report it to the police.

&amp;#x200B;

They didn't do anything. The police closed my case 12 days after I reported it. For years, I wondered what they did to investigate it. For years, I wondered what I did to seem so unbelievable.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm a reporter. I know how freedom of information laws work. So I submitted a FOIL request to the NYPD for my own case file. They never did anything. They only took my statement and reviewed the footage from my building that I had given them. I told them the other intern remembered me being passed out downstairs with vomit covering my coat. I told them both he and the employee recalled the bartender telling them I needed to be taken home because I was too intoxicated. I told them the address and the name of the bar, but my case file shows that police never went to the bar. They never interviewed the witness or the alleged perpetrator. They never obtained any surveillance footage. They never talked to the bartender who saw me passed out downstairs and demanded that I leave.

&amp;#x200B;

This all makes me very sad. I tried to do the right thing the second time. Maybe it's my fault. I of course have moved on with my life and stored these sort of things in the back burner of my mind; I never chose to think about them. But like I said, I'm a reporter, and I do write about sexual assault cases from time to time. It makes my heart hurt to see the diligence with which some special victims detectives investigated their cases. It hurts to see rape victims weaponized in a partisan debate for Supreme Court Justices and the Presidency. I don't know what else to say, it's just a hurt that will never go away."

So long story short, I received an EY internship offer for the 2019 Summer after attending EY's Sophomore ELP Program.

\- I studied for about 3 months (along with my internship and subsequently college)

\- Mostly prepared for the Verbal section as English is not my first language, and I am not at all a habitual reader.

&amp;#x200B;

Before starting my studies seriously I gave the paper test -1 in the official GRE guide, and scored 317. I lost majority of my marks in verbal and only 2 marks in Quant. Then I mainly spent my time doing vocabulary - Magoosh and Barron's 800.

After a month, I started preparing for Quant section - basically revising the topics and formulas from the Manhattan 5 lb book. I gave practice a practice test from the Princeton's guide, and the paper test-2 from the Official guide and scored 322 and 321 respectively, not improving in Quant due to silly mistakes.

Then I spent the rest of the time practicing RCs and Quant questions to improve upon my weaknesses, and kept revising and learning the word lists.

After a few weeks, of preparation I gave the powerprep-1 and scored 329 (162 V, 167 Q) and after a week I scored 327(159 V and 168 Q) in powerprep-2.

Having constantly heard on the internet that the powerpreps are supposed to be very close to the actual test, I was content with my preparation. (mimicking the exam center experience as closely as possible)  

2 days later I go to give the actual exam, and to my surprise the actual exam was tougher than all 4 of the official tests give by ETS. Starting from the beginning, I was able to finish up the Quant section 5-10 minutes earlier in every test, but the questions in the actual test were lengthier and trickier than any official material and I could not even finish my second Quant section. The verbal section had a lot more of the vocabulary I had never seen before, and had tougher questions. So, I ended up getting 154 in verbal and 166 in Quant.

I am writing this post to warn anyone who reads this that maybe do not rely too much on the official practice tests. Maybe try to give tougher exams than the official tests to get a realistic conservative expectation. 

If you are still preparing for GRE or are going to, I would recommend that you should actually read the latest news and learn words from the articles because I felt that the actual exam used a lot of the ""latest"" vocabulary that is being used instead of the lists provide by Barron's or Magoosh (both of them are good for a base though).

Without going into details it's a lot of software related work that involves using some semi-complex software as a measuring tool. 

I'm having a ton of trouble understanding how the software works, which is difficult enough when I get to use the English version on my computer. Using the German version is beyond difficult. So I've asked my supervisor if he can teach me about it more. He just says ""learning by doing"" and goes back to his desk. I'm sure I'll figure out how to do what I need to do somewhat quickly, but I just needed to vent a bit.

Anyone else have issues like this?"

Firstly thank you to everyone that submitted a post talking about their experiences with the test. The community is an invaluable resource that I would credit a lot of my success to. 

I took the test yesterday, scoring highly in the Verbal section but arguably underperforming (relative to practice tests) in the Quant. I'll be applying to LSE MSc Finance, Oxford Financial Economics, Imperial MSc Finance, HEC Paris MSc Finance amongst others and whilst the overall score arguably sits within the range of acceptable scores, I feel that the Quant might drag me down. 
Insert from Oxford website ""We recommend that the quantitative scores are in the 90th percentile, the verbal scores are in the 80th percentile and the analytical writing score is at least 5.""


I could sit the test in two weeks and try again, hoping for a similar Verbal and better Quant, but that would delay applications for the Masters, Summer Internships and probably make me fall behind on Undergrad work. 

Also in the interest of context I have a few Internships in Finance, one in each summer of my undergrad and as I am in my final year (third) now, I'm also working 3 days a week in a Fintech startup in London. I'm on track for a first in a relatively quantitative subject (Economics) and I can show that my Quantitative skills are good enough to handle real world challenges by handling both the theoretical and numerical elements of the AI algorithm at work. 

If anyone can provide any insight into my situation I'd appreciate it, thanks for reading. "
9ninj7,6,2018-10-12,I broke up with my gf/best friend after a 2 year relationship.,alwinaind,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/9ninj7/i_broke_up_with_my_gfbest_friend_after_a_2_year/,"I started dating my best friend in the last few months of high school. We had been best friends for over a year and a half. We had great chemistry, we could to each other about anything without the fear of being judged and when we started dating it was even better. 
Although she isn't the type of person who likes to share a lot but with me she said she used to share the most. 

This year around February I got a little busy with my internship and she started freaking out about her final year specialization. We both got pretty occupied with our academics and we started meeting less often and even the texts got from every single day to once or twice in a week, and we only used to have a conversation on text when I started it, there never was an initiative from her side, she said that she was pretty stressed out about her specialization. She wouldn't share much about it with me saying that I wouldn't understand as I am not in the same position as her's. This went on for a month and on March 14th ( I remember the date becuase it was my mom's birthday) I called her to meet up as we had not seen each other for a while, she said she'll call me up when her classes are over. She didn't call, I called her back and she said that she was already home and the meeting had slipped out of her mind. I was enraged, even though this seems a minor issue but there was stuff piling up which lead me to proposing that we take a break and consider working on the relationship. She said it's better to break up than just take a break. I didn't want to string her along with me so I decided to let her go. That night her friends spoke to me and told that this is not what she wants, all of this is a misunderstanding and that I should confront her and talk this whole issue out. So the next day I went to see her and somewhat sorted things out, we agreed that we were not on a break anymore and that we will work on our communication. The main issue was us not talking to each other so I proposed several methods to improve on that. I told her that she can call me anytime and we can speak, I even asked her to play PUBG mobile so that we get a chance to speak to each other through the in-game voice chat. For sometime it worked but then again our conversations started to die out. 

After another month in April I again told her that we are not talking enough to each other, again we would only speak if I texted first. She said that she can't do this anymore. She said that for her we were still on a break and that this relationship which used to be a support for her had become yet another reason for stress and that she wants to end it as she cannot handle stress from academics and the relationship. I asked her to speak in person the next day, she agreed.

The next day I meet with her, she tells that she got her preferred specialization. When we came to the relationship part she had already made up her mind but she wanted us to be friends, so I decided to let her go again and I left in a hurry, without giving her much of a chance to speak. 

I came to my room and I realized that she should have gotten a chance to speak so I texted her again and she said that we shouldn't talk about this anymore, I insisted and she said that she always loved me as a friend. This infuriated me, I couldn't believe that I was friendzoned for over 2 years, I was heartbroken, I blocked her from all social media and deleted all the photos, I cried the whole night. 

In the morning I received a mail from her clarifying her ""I love you as a friend"" part saying that she really loved me but she couldn't love me in a traditional girlfriend way, she said she doesn't know how to express love in a romantic manner. I said to her that I never wanted her to be a traditional girlfriend that was one of the key reasons I started dating her I never wanted a girlfriend who is obsessed about taking selfies and shopping like most girls that I knew in my school and college. 

By now I thought that there was a chance for us to get back together but she didn't want to. So days went by and I tried to be a friend to her but that was he'll for me. I still used to cry myself to sleep. 

All of our common friends told me that this is a bullshit reason to break up and that we should talk this out. But she doesn't want to talk about this or talk to me in general. It had been around 5 months since our break and a new start of our our supposed ""friendship"" and she didn't reach out to me once, every time we had spoken was when I started the conversation and most of her replies were ""hmm"", ""k"", ""cool"". 

I still hadn't moved on, neither had she shown any interest in getting back together so I decided that I should ask her to leave my life completely, to not keep any kind of contact with me or see me again. She agreed instantly. 

But now I miss her even more than before, especially because we have almost the same set of friends from school and whenever I speak to any of my school friends I'm reminded of her. 

The worst part is, the very first  reason she gave for break up was that she was stressed about her specialization and career, and the day we broke was the day when she had successfully received the specialization of her choice. 

Also she was this one person I could talk to anytime about anything and her departure is the event when I needed this person the most.

I always feel if I had controlled my anger and not speak about the break, we would have been a happy couple. I probably would have been happier and had one more good friend. 

This is the worst fuck up of my life and I have been sulking ever since. I tried to move on and failed now I don't know what to do.  "
9nipr0,7,2018-10-12,Negotiating compensation as an intern?,Jepiero,cerner,https://www.reddit.com/r/cerner/comments/9nipr0/negotiating_compensation_as_an_intern/,"This is my second year interviewing with Cerner for the Software Engineering Intern position. The first year I went to an on-site interview and fell in love with the innovations campus as well as Kansas City. Unfortunately, they did not extend an offer. However, this year I was lucky enough to get one. They were the first ones to offer me, but I have obtained other offers since including one that offers $12 more an hour than what they offer me. The downside to this offer is that it would not include housing while Cerner offers free housing at UMKC for the summer. 

I have a phone call scheduled with a recruiter coming up soon and was wondering how likely it would be for me to negotiate compensation? Does anyone have any previous experience with this? Does Cerner even do this with their interns?

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
9nkgv2,1,2018-10-12,"My Dad (53M) left his job to start his own business, Mom (55 M) is now breadwinner while I (21 M) live at home (attending University). My Mom keeps picking fights with me and I don't know what to do.",DUDETUDE101,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9nkgv2/my_dad_53m_left_his_job_to_start_his_own_business/,"First off, apologies for any formatting issues as I'm writing this on mobile. This is quiet long and I don't think reading a TLDR would be useful as this is a longwinded and messy situation  (at least for me, anyway).

Okay so 5 years ago my Dad (who was working as a senior manager in the finance department of a major corporation, making about $200000 a year) resigned from his position to start his own financial management business, along with a number of his friends.

Initially, they tried to secure contracts with our government but lost out because they couldn't/didn't bribe the right people (our government contract procurement process is quiet corrupt, but which country's isn't amirite?).

They switched focus to the private sector, bit didn't make any real money for years. When this all started, I was in Grade 10. Now, my family consists of me, my parents, my younger brother  (15 years) and sister (19 years). We were always well off growing up, and all three of us were in fairly expensive private schools. 

My Dad must have used a lot of his savings, as well as selling off properties and other assets he had as for two years our lifestyle did not really change. During my final year of Highschool we moved to a smaller house but everything was fairly normal. None of us kids knew he was self-employed.

I graduated and enrolled at University, no financial aid/loans or external funding as I didn't think I needed to apply for such since we were 'well off'. Skip to January 2018 and I receive notice from my University that I will be unable to register to study this year until I pay off my fees. Which were apparently delayed in payment multiple times over the two years by my father, without my knowledge. (I realised then that I could have and should have been checking my University account status regularly myself, but again for much of my early life we were upper middle class so I never thought about money or accounts in my name etc.)

I talk to my Dad. He explains everything. How he's self employed, business has been stagnant  (he's had to go through hoops to get proper accreditation etc.), his money has dried up. I can't go to university this year, nor get a loan (we tried and failed), nor apply for financial aid (we make / have too much money to qualify but not enough for me to go this year).

I feel angry and betrayed because, knowing none of this, I had no time to apply for bursaries or private funding of any kind, which I would have done if I was told timeously.
This was a moment in which I saw real shame in my Dad's eyes, and unfortunately lost respect for him.

From January until the FIFA World Cup, I'm at home and too depressed to do anything really. I don't apply for jobs or internships and rarely leave the house. My Mom  (who is a qualified social worker but was a STAHM during much of my life) has gone back to work and is now the breadwinner. She's quite traditional and believes my Dad should be supporting us, and he keeps rattling on (for months) about how he's waiting for an investment of $10 Million to come through on a deal he is overseeing regarding a waste management plant. They begin fighting a lot. I'd never seen my parents fight or bicker before this year but now it's everyday. 

Thankfully, my Mom gets promoted within her organisation and is able to pay off enough of my fees to go back to university next year. But earlier this month we moved again and now our family of 5 live in a small 3 bedroom, two bathroom apartment (relatively small for my family as it's smallest place we've ever lived in), since that is what my Mom can afford on her own. 

My sister went to university for her first year this year, but still lives at home. I assume her fees aren't paid for the year yet.

All of this has led to my relationship with my parents being really strained, for a number of reasons:

1. My Dad seems to be a liar, who will do anything to protect his pride, and as such I can't and don't trust him anymore. This one hurts as I always saw him as hard working and honest, and looked up to him.

2. My mother hasn't cleared my student debt yet and is holding the money saved in her account. She paid 25% earlier this week. However, she's started using it as blackmail whenever angry at me, shouting ""I'm paying your school fees!"" as a weapon. I always try and respond with gratitude but am afraid of what would happen if she decided not to pay by next year's due date.

3. In relation to 2. I've noticed my Mom is now continually picking fights with me. This started the day we downsized ( last Monday). I'll be standing somewhere, on my phone and she'll ask me a question like: ""do you want this can of soda?"", I'll respond ""No, thank you. I'm not thirsty."" and she'll reply ""Jesus, I was just trying to be nice.  Don't be arrogant!"" which will start a ten-minute argument and inevitably she'll say ""I'm paying your school fees!"".

4. I must note that I'm a CS 2nd year student who has been looking for a job, ANY job, since August. I've had 3 interviews for sales and call center jobs but had no luck yet. Everytime I've gone for an interview my Mom has gotten angry at me. Telling me I don't need to do that, she's providing. I would tell her I'm saving for a laptop and she's get angry, saying she'll buy me one (doubtful).

5. As if this is some sick joke I've also been dealing with tinnitus due to TMJ issues. I've just got a nightguard from my dentist so hopefully that clears it. But it's made me less able to control myself and stop arguments before they happen.

6. My mother seems to now hate my Dad and 'all men'. She tells me how 'men are useless' in front of my father. She tells my sister to be careful. She says marriage is overrated. Never heard any of this before August (she was always so proud of being a mother and wife to 'such a beautiful husband'). This makes me not want to talk to her anymore but if I try and shut down our conversations she tells me it's disrespectful and that ""I'm paying for your school fees!""

There are 4 months until I start attending University again, which will keep me out of the house for most of the day. Until then (or I get a job, which I look for and apply for everyday) I'm stuck at home learning web dev and keeping my math skills sharp. My question is: how do I keep my head down and fly under the radar, keep my Mom as happy with me as possible so she keeps assisting me financially, and just keep it together at least until I go back to university? (I have applied for over 30 bursaries for next year, none successfully as of yet btw).

Anyway, thanks to whomever for taking the time to read this jumbled collection of paragraphs. I really don't know what to do. For years my parents were so NICE (they were good parents growing up, it seemed) , so I don't think this is a r/raisedbynarcissists situation, but maybe that was all not the 'truth'?. I don't know."

I taught myself how to code in R and a bit of Python, plus SQL and I’m planning to take a minor in computer science. 

When I look for internships, I find that most companies would much rather hire a software engineer/mathematician/statistician as a data analyst and I am not sure whether this is due to CSS being a fairly new discipline ( = employers don’t know about it) or that simply our skillset isn’t techy enough. 

Do you have any experience in working as a data analyst with a CSS degree? If not, where do you work and do you like it?

Sorry if this question sounds dumb, but since I hated every second of my useless bachelor and the lack of job opportunities that followed I’m a bit freaked out about where/how to work. 

Thanks

We are both now back in our home-states and living about 4 hours away from each other. We have been together officially for about 2 months now, which is not long at all.

I have been very busy and stressed with graduate school and she has been stressed finding a job as she recently graduated. She found a job last week and will be moving to somewhere 10 hours away from where I am now, which I am completely supportive of.

The problem is that both of us are so tired and so stressed out that we are having a hard time being there for each other. I feel like I keep letting her down whenever she needs something, which is usually to not talk about things as that overwhelms her. I have a hard time doing that and always want to try and help, which I realize is not helpful so I have pulled back from that. We both also struggle with depression to some extent, although at the moment, hers has been especially burdensome. I have a hard time not talking about things because I feel like things are strained between us, but she just wants to chat whenever we talk to get her mind off things, or not chat at all.

I feel terrible and like a failure. I feel like I can't express my needs or how I am feeling sad about some things, like her not being able to come to a wedding with me anymore next weekend because she needs to get things ready for her move to her new job. I completely understand, but feel like I should be able to be sad about it. I am not mad at her at all, just sad I don't get to see her, but I feel like anytime I say something like that she takes it personally and I feel bad.

I realize we are both in very stressful stages of life right now. At the moment we are taking a break from talking (not dating) and will talk again in a few days because every time we talk we seem to fight this week. 

I know I need to be more selfless and supportive of her as she is dealing with the stresses of moving, so any advice for how to handle this situation would be beneficial. I just don't know what to do. I feel really guilty.

Thanks."

Hello,

My name is Joseph Opdenaker and I am the Marketing Intern for Philadelphia Union.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know there is a rivalry between our temas and that I am taking a risk to go behind enemy lines right now BUT... I can offer discounted tickets to attend this game with huge rivalry, playoff, and Supporters Shield impacts on the line.  

&amp;#x200B;

We are doing a sales competition amongst the current interns for the last home game against our biggest rivals, the New York Red Bulls.  The atmosphere is always raised up several notches when we play the Red Bulls and they are often the most electrifying games of the season.  With it being our biggest rivalry, and with the team looking to keep some positive momentum entering the playoffs, we would love to have you join us on **Sunday, October 21 at 3:00 pm.**

Red Bulls is currently the second best team in the MLS Supporters Shield rankings and the Union just clinched a playoff spot, are playing the best soccer in our club’s history, and could potentially finish this season as high as third place, currently fourth, depending on the results of our last two games.  It is certainly a very exciting time to be a Philadelphia Union supporter.  This is a game you do not want to miss and there are two different options to purchase tickets.

* If your group is smaller than **10+** people then you can purchase from the link below.  If you use this link, the only thing I ask is that you please put my name, **Joseph Opdenaker**, when the site asks which intern referred you to this purchase.  ***These tickets include a*** ***group discount*** ***but there will be a per ticket fee.***
   * [https://groupmatics.events/event/UFallIntern18](https://groupmatics.events/event/UFallIntern18)
* If your group is of **10 or more**, then you can email me, at the address below, I will then send you a sheet to fill out and send back to me. 
   * [jopdenaker@philadelphiaunion.com](mailto:jopdenaker@philadelphiaunion.com) 
* We also have a lot of families that can’t attend the game but still like to donate tickets to kids in Chester or military families. If you would like to donate tickets, then you can email me, at the address below, I will then send you a sheet to fill out and send back to me.

Thank you and looking forward to seeing you on the 21st.

9nmylv,1,2018-10-12,I've (23F) been getting anxious about my boyfriend's (21M) social media usage and worried it will ruin our relationship (9 months so far),shyntwyss,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9nmylv/ive_23f_been_getting_anxious_about_my_boyfriends/,"I decided to post here because I'm really lost about how to go about improving things within my relationship and at a bit of a desperation point and considering ending things. I know the people in this subreddit often have insightful things to say that I would never consider. I would rather work things out than break up but I have been considering the latter for a while now.  We are both university students and I'll call him Nathan though that's not his real name. Apologies but this is going to be quite a long one!   


We had a bit of a crazy start 9 months ago where things progressed really quickly due to unexpected circumstances on my behalf. I got kicked out of my room by my landlord on short notice (can give more details separately if anyone's interested, it wasn't anything I did wrong) and even before becoming exclusive with Nathan, he offered for me to stay with him. I thought he was just saying that to reassure me that things would be okay, but he was deadly serious and since I had lots of deadlines coming up and felt overwhelmed by everything, I decided that this would be the safest thing for me to do. 

So just over 1 month into our relationship, we moved in together and have been living in a small studio since then. He told me he loved me 1 week into our relationship and apparently I was the first person to ever hear that from him. I didn't say it to him until quite a while later.  He's a very good looking guy but weirdly doesn't have much of a relationship history to speak of. 

I was a bit thrown off by it all but I figured since we'd known each other for a few months he might have had feelings for me before we were dating.  I was just focused on the fun of getting to know each other and helping each other out in stressful times. He dealt with a lot in that time and I was there for him seeing as he helped me out when I was in a terrible situation myself.   


He was quite insecure at the beginning and early on got so jealous of me speaking to a guy at a bar who was part of a university club we were both in, that we had to go outside to talk about it. I ended up offering for us to go home early despite me having a really good time meeting some new friends with shared interests. It was quite frustrating but I figured that I cared more about his happiness than a couple more hours with people that I barely know.  I've started to seriously regret this decision because he has not shown me the same consideration at times recently where I've felt uncomfortable with people has was around.  


I'm not normally a very jealous person but somehow his jealousy and anxiety lead to me questioning whether there was something going on on this end that was causing this sort of overreaction and it fed into me being worried about when he was seeing female friends etc. He had a friend from back home who he shared poems with on Facebook and I was curious who she was so I looked her up on Instagram and found some posts where he had commented things like ''Cutie Xxx'' and ''Beautiful Xx''. This sparked some crazy stalking obsession where I wanted to find more evidence of him being inappropriate in this way and periodically since this time I've been checking his social media for anything that makes me miserable. I can't see any of his likes on Instagram so I've resorted to clicking on profiles of people he follows so see how much he's been interacting with girls he knows on there.   


Basically he's a person who is super friendly with everyone and pretty much anyone he meets he sort of looks like he's flirting with them, but also everyone likes him a lot and feels comfortable around him. I've found this quite difficult to come to terms with, but we talked about it and he reasurred me that this was just how he was brought up and his whole family is similar and very sociable. He apparently does it to seem less threatening because he's very big/tall.  In terms of social media he ''likes'' loads of posts and he's friends with loads of attractive girls.  I'm more of an introverted person though I do have quite a large circle of close friends, I go more for quality than quantity compared to Nathan. He spends loads of time on instagram and facebook liking loads of photos, and there are loads of girls where he's liked/loved every single photo they've posted. This makes me really uncomfortable and  even more so when they are bikini/exposed photos, which included some photos like this of his ex.   


After a long time of keeping this stalking behaviour to myself I recently talked to him about it and expressed how uncomfortable his pattern of activity makes me. I told him that it's probably not something I could ever come to terms with and perhaps it means we aren't compatible. At first he was quite defensive but in the end he removed Instagram from his phone and unfollowed one of his ""friends"" who only posted bikini photos (he said he was liking all her posts to help her out). When I asked him about the comments he left on the other girls insta he told me it was just ''girl culture'' and he was saying it sort of as a joke?  I don't know lol.  I wasn't very happy with how he responded to me bringing things up because he was making excuses for himself rather than offering to change anything to put me at ease. Removing the app altogether seemed OTT to me.    


The next day I was quite ready to talk about breaking up and I brought things up again and said I'm upset about how he responded to me telling him how i felt and I felt invalidated. He agreed to tone it down and stop liking biki pics and whatever. For a week and a bit I was really pleased but then I found that he'd liked another basically naked picture of someone he knows personally and it feels like the whole shebang was for nothing. He also has instagram again as of today but is hiding his online status from me, I can just see that he's liked stuff from mutual friends.   
 

I don't think he would physically cheat but I do feel like his engaging with all these people serves some kind of need to give attention to other women and I don't really understand why it's more important to him than making me feel secure being with him. I know there are girls out there who wouldn't be bothered by this at all but I think with me being used to more introverted people it's difficult to let it go. He seems to prioritise casual friendships over me sometimes.   


  There was also a weird situation with a girl he was working with over the summer, they were spending all their breaks together (And with a few other interns) and I got a bit worried when I saw that he was messaging her on fb as well as texting, so I asked who she was cause he never mentioned anything about her before. Then a week before their intership finished they had drinks and he came home early looking really upset, told me she made a move on him or something and when he didn't cooperate she said he'd ''changed''. As a consequence he asked me to join their next night out so he could still hang out with the other people without feeling weird. I felt quite unwelcome since I wasn't really part of the circle (he didn't try to include me before this but I had exams so I think that's why he thought i wouldn't want to go). He has been quite insistent that he wants to stay friends with her even though I told him I wasn't keen on the idea, but hasn't actually met up with that group since finishing the intership.  
He's close friends with someone he's slept with before who was a flatmate and they've been on holidays and she has visited his parents' house with the rest of the flatmates. I met her and she was lovely and I'm cool with her, just to prove that I'm not way too crazy if there's no reason for me to worry.

Just for completeness I figure I'd say that he is super affectionate and in generally good at listening to me, we have great sex and he's keen to help out with my chores when I'm stressed. There's plenty of things we enjoy doing together, it's just when things get hectic for either of us that our intimacy falls apart somewhat and I worry that he turns to other people to meet his emotional needs.  I just have a general bad feeling in terms of my intuition somehow and I don't understand what's going on or how to resolve it. 

  
If anything doesn't make sense or I should elaborate, feel free to ask and I'm happy to clarify so I can get the best advice possible:)   


TL:DR - Boyfriend is very active on social media, likes a lot of girls' photos that he knows personally, some of which are basically nude. I have told him I find it uncomfortable but not sure if he took me seriously, he said it's part of his personality to be super friendly. How to deal? Am I being unreasonable?"

|**Total Monthly Expenses**|**$10,381**|
|**Leftover**|**$1,619**|

Take a look at how changing the contribution to the 403b affects the taxes I pay. Basically we increased our monthly contribution from $600 to $3,000 (a big jump), which then caused our taxes to drop from $1,000 to $500 per month. So we basically save $6,000 per year on taxes by putting extra money in our retirement. We can afford it so we might as well do it. Now even as a resident with a spouse, my wife and I are putting of $48,822 per year in a retirement account, which is roughly 34% of our income. 

It's possible to make good money as a resident... you just need a spouse that has a job that also makes a reasonable amount of money. None of this would be possible without that second part of the sentence. "
9nnd2l,72,2018-10-12,For fellow DACA recipients between the ages of 18-25 who are lost in life.,Cartoons4adults,DACA,https://www.reddit.com/r/DACA/comments/9nnd2l/for_fellow_daca_recipients_between_the_ages_of/,"If you're between the ages of 18-25 and you're unsure of what to do moving forward after high school then I highly recommend you check out this valuable and effective IT/Communications/Professional Training program called Year Up. [https://www.yearup.org/](https://www.yearup.org/)

Primary points to note:

* Have to dress professionally every day
* Classes are college level courses that are linked to a community college that the program partners with
* You have your choice of a specialized track (IT/cyber security/ project coordination/ data analytics/ finance)
* Entire program lasts a year in which you receive a certificate of completion upon graduating
* 6 months of training in specialized track through projects, assignments, presentations
* **6 MONTHS OF INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE** \- Depending on performance contract extension and or full time conversion might be issued
* Some tracks offer separate certificates from other programs Year Up has partnered with
* Strong sense of community and the cultivation of an interactive network in which anyone can reach out to anyone within that network
* **STIPEND OF $300 EVERY 2 WEEKS** for the first 6 months of training. Increases to **$500 EVERY 2 WEEKS** during internship. Yes, **THEY** pay **YOU** to attend, however...
* Student discipline is tracked through a point system that starts at 200 points in total. You are deducted points for being tardy, missing assignments, late assignments, or violating core values. These are called infractions and should honestly not be a problem if you're the type of person who is actually trying to make something of themselves. Whenever you receive an infraction you are also reduced pay from your next stipend
* The program is partnered with over 200 companies
* The program is offered nationwide in major cities in both the west and east coast.

My experience:

I'll try to keep this brief, if you have any questions feel free to ask in the comment section. 

I took the program when I was 24. I was accepted into the Data Analytics track. We trained in data analytics software like Excel, MySQL, Tableau, and Python. The program that was partnered with Year Up that offered our lessons was the Colaberry School of Data Analytics. At the end of our training phase, students in my track received licensed certificates of completion in the software we trained in. It looks great on my resume. I interned as an HR Data Analyst for fortune 500 company, Robert Half. I interned for 6 months and then they extended my contract for another 3. I honestly learned A LOT there on how to think analytically, how to present findings, how to use software in a corporate setting, and so much more. Afterwards, I landed a contract position as an HR Workday Analyst for about 4 months at Samsung. I was making really good money, 25 at RH, and 27 at Samsung. Now I'm working as a costing accountant. It's not in the same field, but I really enjoy the schedule because it gives me the flexibility to go to school when I decide to go back. I wouldn't have been able to land this role without all the professional work experience I accrued. I'll be able to move out this January with enough money to go back to school and finish my associates in psychology and then I'll go forward with obtaining data analytics certificates from UC Berkeley Extension, which will increase my chances significantly of finding a full time role in data analytics. Year up helped make all this possible for me, literally life changing. I hope this posts helps someone who is wandering aimlessly through life like I was."
9nnvbp,2,2018-10-12,[M4F] CEO gets BBC'd,distracted_boyfriend,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9nnvbp/m4f_ceo_gets_bbcd/,"ALL CHARACTERS ARE 18 YEARS OLD OR OLDER

At 6’0 tall and with a hulking physique that was a product of a strict gym regimen, Taylor Robertson looked like a man who would be more at home on the basketball court or a rap video, than in a board room. Yet the corporate jungle was truly where he belonged. Against all odds and silent racism, he had risen to become the first black director on the board, eventually paving the way for other black men to become part of the board.

His rise to the top was not without controversy however, as his appetite for women (especially white women) had given him something of a reputation within the company. It was an open secret (among the men, at least, who spoke of the rumors with a mixture of jealousy and admiration) that he had been bedding secretaries, interns and even employees wives’. But while his detractors in the office had been desperately trying to get rid of him on charges of sexual misconduct or harassment, none of them have been able to make the charges stick since none of the alleged women would cooperate in any investigation.

Besides, his acumen for business and making profits was enough to keep most of the board happy, and they were willing to overlook his dalliances as long as he was bringing in the money. The majority of the board had been so pleased with his performance, that he was poised to become the next CEO after old man Derrickson’s retirement. Unfortunately for him, the old bastard had appointed her daughter as CEO in a move that took the entire board by surprise just this morning.

Taylor wouldn’t allow this setback the foil his plans, and immediately started planning on how to own the new CEO with his secret weapon: his monstrous black cock that every white girl in the office couldn’t have enough of, once they got their first taste. He would let her keep her title as CEO, while he would be the one behind the scenes pulling the strings as he enslaved her with his thick black cock.

- 200-300 words per response (no need to write me a novel)

- play over reddit messages only

9no35p,1,2018-10-12,I cursed at my mom out of anger and frustration. I deeply regret it.,hamilton44fan,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/9no35p/i_cursed_at_my_mom_out_of_anger_and_frustration_i/,"Im having another rough semester. My GPA isn’t the best to begin with and I was barely passing two classes so it was going to drop even further. No matter how hard I tried (going to every class, I kept failing on my midterms in two of my classes that is.

Last Friday after getting two D’s on midterms finally I’d just had enough. I yelled and cursed in the air repeatedly. When I got back to my dorm room I banged the door, threw my backpack down on the ground and kicked it numerous times against the wall.

​

This is my phone conversation with my mother:

Me: Where are you?! Are you on your way?! I need to talk to you about something.

Mom: I just left. Whats up?!

Me: What do you mean you just left?! You’re supposed to have left like 30 minutes ago. What the f**k is taking so long?!

Mom: I was at work Steven. Is there that you'd like to talk about?!

Me: “You can’t be this f****g self-absorbed to put your laptop down for one second to realize that you have to come pick me up?! We could have been on our way back home by now. Hurry the **** up and get your f****g *** over here right now. 

Mom: Steven calm down you know better not to talk me like that

Me: What do you mean?! I’m so f*****g sick tired of dealing with f*****g idiots like you who can’t be bothered to show up on time because they’re too self absorbed. 

Mom: Ok Steven I'm going to ask you one more time. Whats going on?!

Me: I'm struggling in my classes yet again this semester. It just seems like no matter what I do, it never seems to work. I'm so f*****g tired of this s**t. Maybe I should just jump into the Kiskwaukee River and end it once and for all. I'm so f****g done with life.

Mom: You're gonna kill yourself just because you're doing bad in a few classes?!

Me: Do you ******* not get it? I'm studying accounting with the hopes of getting a job after graduation. I need a 3.0 GPA in order to get internships. Right now my GPA is 2.8 and with the way classes are going, its gonna drop to a 2.6. I’m gonna be nothing but an unemployed dumbass loser for the rest of my ****** life. 

Mom: Steve I'll see you when I get to NIU we'll talk more. I'm in the middle of a construction zone. Hangs up the phone.

I continue kicking my backpack around and punching my pillow cursing and screaming rages.

# Some information:

I started producing about a year ago and it has already been a crazy journey.

Soon after I started working on my craft, I coincidently met another producer from my university that happened to be living on the same floor as me during an internship. We started working together and I learned a ton as a beginner being with someone more experienced. That producer also turned out to be working with a local upcoming artist in Seattle. As time passed, we all started working together as a collective.

Fast forward to now, a year ago, we're still going strong with an upcoming EP. It's been an absolute blessing to be able to grow myself as a producer working with other producers and with an artist.

This single that we have released is truly just the beginning and we can't wait to share more music with you all soon.

Thanks!"

EMS in rural areas is done differently; rules are more relaxed because things can get really intense. The Golden Hour does not exist where we are.

Good fortune and good preparation were to be the heroes of this day. Our ambulance was stocked for ‘whatever may come’ type of scenarios and we carried extra; extra of everything. Two 50mg vials of morphine and two 30mg vials of epinephrine along with multiple doses of everything else were normal stock levels. I thought it was overkill; but today would change my mind.

“All EMS personnel, all EMS personnel; we need an ambulance at 1781 County Road 1604. Man and woman swarmed by killer bees.” I heard our lead paramedic come across the radio and instructed dispatch to call for a second ambulance; good intuition has now come into play. In a volunteer system the nature of the call determines the level of response. A call for a ‘broken hip’ would find you begging for someone to respond while a ‘major 10-50’ got you all the help you needed. But the call for killer bees brought them out of the woodwork; and that was a very good thing. Both ambulances pulled out of the station with 4 on board; and the race was on. Stings are notorious for causing a condition called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction (venom, medications, and chemicals) that can cause the throat and tongue to swell along with a deadly drop in blood pressure. This systemic process can occur in hours, or in just minutes; and it is a coin toss which it will be.

The call had come in from a bag phone (the cell phones of today did not exist) and there had been no further contact. We had been told that the main gate was locked and that we should wait for a Suburban which would be coming out. Since this was a large ranch and had its own roads we had no way of knowing which road led where; all we could do was wait. Precious minutes were ticking by and I was all for breaking the lock and mounting a search, but in the distance someone spotted dust. We saw the vehicle pull up to a gate and the driver got out to unlock it; there were no more gates between us, except for the one we stood at. A deputy had arrived and decided to cut a link in the chain that secured the gate which allowed the Suburban to come on through.

We already had the stretchers out and lowered so we sat them down and began to treat right there on the shoulder of the road. Both had on sleeveless shirts and stingers were everywhere. Someone said “Where am I going to put the B/P cuff?” “Use your driver license and scrape until you have a place big enough” came a reply. “Shirt’s coming off” someone told the lady, “I don’t care” she said. Drew, a paramedic who was getting a line on the man looked at me and said “Bill, draw up 1mg Epi and give it IM, wait 5 minutes and repeat.” I was still a paramedic intern but like I said, rules are relaxed in a rural setting. The other crew was working as feverishly as we were so things were looking up. We had IV access and Epi was on board; it was time to take a breath. An EMT had gone over to look at the Suburban and found a small dog lying on the back seat. She brought it over and it was diaphoretic and struggling to breathe; I did not know that a dog could sweat that much. Drew looked at me and said “Give me a mg of Epi” and I said “Are you kidding me?” He gave me that weird look he sometimes gives and said “What can it hurt, might as well give it a chance” Within seconds the dog was panting at a rate somewhere around 60; but at least the air was moving. That pup said Thank You with its eyes; and you will just have to take my word on that.

With one patient in each ambulance and the pet with the deputy, we were ER bound. A relative of the couple met us at the hospital; she took the dog and headed to the nearest vet which was 22 miles south. We put husband and wife in the same room, stripped them down and began the tedious work of removing hundreds of stingers. There was an odor emanating from these two that I could not (and still cannot) describe, but it made me feel uncomfortable. Stingers were everywhere; scalp, face, neck, shoulders, arms, hands. Everybody was working on some part of someone’s body when all of a sudden, and within seconds of each other, both of them released their bowels. The smell was unlike anything you can imagine and it just kept coming. I believe, and will continue to believe, that their bodies pulled the venom from their system and eliminated it in the fastest manner possible.

We were wrapping things up when the deputy caught my eye and motioned for me. “The dog died before they made it to the vet” he said. I walked over and gave the lady the news. She looked me, nodded her head and said, “His name was Charlie.”"

(Rough Idea),Soupandsaladbarfan,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9npimv/m4f_the_intern_affair_rough_idea/,"I would love to play out a scene where you are an intern at my company; its not a well paying job, but its in the field you want so you take what you can get. Despite the low pay, you always seem to be dressed better then the other interns and you are open about not coming from money. During your nights you make the vast majority of your money as an escort, its not something you are proud of, but you have your fun and your clients treat you well. 

I would be rich, married and the last person that anyone would expect to cheat on their wife. You've met her a few times as shes come to the office and you've seen how we interact as she perfectly placed by my side. You do have a bit of a crush on me as you do like older men, but push it aside to remain professional.

The scene would start with your arrival at a room for a new client, which of course be me. Would love to explore your submission to not only a client you are attracted to, but to your boss that could ruin your job and to a potential sugar daddy if you are worth what the escort company charges. 

I wouldnt know who I was getting until I open the door so it would be a surprise to us both. But if you are willing we can explore my marriage and how you would fit in after our initial night together.

Kinks: Anal, creampies, cock worship, cheating, passionate blowjobs, desire, rough and intense sex, public play, shower sex, voice play (if you are willing)

Your family has run Garrett's Fabrics for almost 100 years now, passing down from your grandfather, to your father, to you. In the past things had been good. One of the biggest regional manufacturers, you'd produced clothing that had ended up on catwalks and had been spotted on celebrities. 

But in recent years, things have taken a turn for the worst. With growing competition from multinational companies, people aren't buying local. Why spend $100 on a pair of handcrafted jeans when you can get a pair made in a sweatshop for less than half the price? Although your factory used to have hundreds of people working there, now there's less than a dozen, and even they're struggles to justify staying here when their pay-cheques are so inconsistent. 

One night, another sleepless night going over the paperwork trying to make these impossible sums turn a profit, I knock on your door. I'm a young man fresh out of a degree in business management. Fresh out being the operative word, seeing that I ended up dropping out of my course. With no real qualifications, no real family or friends in the local area, and a desire to make *something* out of my life, I've been knocking around every business in the area trying to get *some* sort of opportunity. I don't even want to be paid, I just want an internship, a chance to prove myself and get some experience. 

However, neither of us could predict how our business relationship was going to pan out. We don't know that we'll find a gap in the market, a gap for luxury lingerie and naughty outfits. We don't know that, having no money to hire models, *I'll* be the one trying them on for the photo shoots. And we don't know that, growing ever close and closer, our relationship will go from strictly business to one of pleasure...

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a long-term feminisation prompt between a failing business owner and a desperate intern. 

I always think these prompts work best when we both have some sort of vulnerabilities. Your character will be a failing business owner (male or female, although the former is preferred) who is stressed out from having to deal with these pressures. Perhaps you've got divorced because of the stresses of the job, or your relationship is on the rocks. My character will be a young man (18+) who is effectively homeless and penniless, looking for any opportunity to get my life started. I like the idea of my character viewing yours as a father figure, with the more sexual implications that brings, but if you're not open to that I understand. 

I would like this feminisation and character development to be long-term and gradual, with our characters naturally changing. I envision a couple of events pushing this, including:

* My character not having any clean clothing, so you offer to let me borrow some stuff from the factory. However, it turns out that the only clothes in my size are for women. 

* You offer to let my character stay in your apartment to stop me having to sleep in the factory. 

* I have to dress in some of the outfits/lingerie for a photoshoot as we can't afford a model. 

I would also like elements of slice of life in this too. And I would love to hear some of your suggestions for these events too!

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports.

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). I'm looking for a partner who appreciates detail, and who really likes to develop their characters. In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. Please include a decent amount of detail in your response, just so I can gauge whether we'd work together. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but short and undetailed messages probably won't get a response.

N.B. and basically all of my past prompts along a similar theme are open too if they take your fancy!"
9nqcip,3,2018-10-12,I [31/m] am in an LDR with a girl [37/f] but I don’t know if I want it anymore. Scared to end it and don’t know if I want to. Or how!,Khayembii,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9nqcip/i_31m_am_in_an_ldr_with_a_girl_37f_but_i_dont/,"At the end of 2016 my girlfriend of five years who I lived with cheated on and dumped me. It was particularly brutal because we lived together.

I [31/m] met this other girl [38/f] by chance shortly after. I was also going through a host of other issues - I paid a mountain of money and moved across the country for an MBA program with the hope of getting a job in my dream field. In fall of 2016 I was rejected after a summer internship and had no luck finding everything else. Needless to say I was at a low point in my life. Probably the worst time of my life ever.

This girl was very supportive. She lived a bit away so we could only see each other on weekends.  It started as a casual thing but morphed into more of a relationship.

It’s been almost two years now. Most of that time I just felt that I was drifting. My life felt on hold. It took me until this summer that I actually got a job in my field. We supported each other that whole time because she was going through stuff too.

Unfortunately I had to move halfway across the country for the job. We kept the relationship going because I was planning on moving back eventually. But the timeline hasn’t been clear because it’s dependent on how fast I can fill my resume.

So I moved, and I’ve just been focusing on relaxing and learning to be happy again. I’ve been so stressed and anxious and depressed for so long. I finally am feeling happy.  I’m getting healthy, quit drinking and even caffeine, fixed my sleep schedule. I love my job. I’m fixing my finances as I’m getting paid well.

I just don’t know if I still want to be in this relationship.

She’s come out once since I moved. We had fun. We always have fun when we’re together. I love and adore her. But she started talking about the future like marriage and stuff and it just freaked me out.  And made me realize that I don’t think I see this as a long term, lifetime thing.

I fee horrible. She’s been so supportive. I don’t want her to fee like I used her just for that then threw her out when I didn’t need it anymore. I do love her.  I care enormously about her. I don’t want to hurt her.

We’re still going but after this realization I just don’t know what to do or how to do it. If I don’t feel like it’s a long term thing I know I should end it.  I just am so scared to hurt her feelings. I also just don’t know if I want to end it. I love having her in my life and don’t want her gone.

But I know it’s probably what I should do. 

Should I?  How do I think about this?  If I need to end it, I have no clue how. Seriously I’m so bad at these things. I’m so scared of losing her.

tl;dr I’ve been in a relationship that’s lasted through some real struggles. Now long distance. But I don’t think I want it anymore. But I don’t know!  And if I end it I don’t know how. I’m terrified. What should I do?"

9nqkpf,3,2018-10-12,Gf wants to break up but is unsure if she will regret it.,Acuteangleobtuse,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/9nqkpf/gf_wants_to_break_up_but_is_unsure_if_she_will/,"TLDR: Long distance, relationship is going great but gf does not feel she is achieving her life goals and wants to experience things on her own but at the same time not break up. I don’t either, I’m here to support her but I do not want to break up.

We have been going strong for a little over a year.

We got together over summer before she left to university of her choice. I told her I didn’t want this to be a summer fling and we decided to try out long distance. 

The first year went great, we communicated and had our arguments like any relationship does. FaceTimed almost every day but we’re respectable with our study time and when we were out with friends. She would fly down to see me and I did the same( not as much, I always had concerts to be performing etc.) the first school year is done and she came back for the summer, we hung out almost every day. Summer with her was amazing, I wasn’t ready for her to go back but it was inevitable of course. Fast forward 4 weeks.

I’m on semester, she’s in quarter system. It’s hard enough as it is. She called me a few days ago wanting to talk. She has been acting strange for about a week or so. Of course I stay up to talk, it’s tipping 2 am, “I want to break up”. I didn’t want to believe it. She talked about how this relationship is great, there is nothing wrong with us, but I want to experience things on my own. She never had plans to marry and want kids like I did- she did not want to think about these things while she’s pursuing her degree. 

Let’s break real quick- before she first left; we talked about if we were getting in each other way of getting an education, we would break up. Education has always been a must in her family so I understood that.

Back to the conversation- I offered a small break- she neglected the idea bc we once talked about taking breaks and said we would never do it.

Alright, I said. We stayed quite for a I minute or so. I said while holding back tears; babe, we’re just gunna have to break up.  We said what we said before you first left and now it’s time to be adults about it.

Don’t say that, it hurts to hear it- I don’t want to break up, our relationship is perfect, it’s stupid that I wanna break up. I’m just not meeting my life goals like I planned, I have been applying to other colleges and internships that would have me going to different states or leaving the country. I’m afraid of this commitment, I never planned to be in a relationship through college. Which I want to make explicitly clear; I don’t wanna break up so I can hook up, fuck that- I’m here to get my education but this is exhausting. I only get to see you 3 months out of the year. I know it’s worth it but it’s exhausting. I don’t want you to hate me.

This conversation went on for a while.
I told her; ok you don’t wanna break up, so let’s take a break. You know what I want, and that’s staying together, but let’s pick a date and we’ll talk again on whether you want to stay together or not. We set ground rules of what can and cannot happen during this break.

She picked a date, and we said goodbye. I disconnected all my social media were we interact the most, I do not know how to go about this. I haven’t been eating, I also haven’t hit the bottles hard( I wouldn’t say I have had a problem but depression and alcoholism has been in the family so I am a little more cautious of when I go out for a drink)

So far I have only told one friend about this, not my roommate or any other close friends, I shouldn’t go about this alone but I do not want tell people about this. 

I have decided to use this break to better myself and to show that I don’t need her in my life, but that I want her to be apart of it. She checks in once in a while to ask how I am doing and I say everything is okay and she says she’s fine. 

I am scared for when the break is over and she says whether or not she wants to continue this long distance. How can I show her that we can continue this. On one end, I want to break it so she can get all the experience she can, I am not trying to hold her back but on the other hand I want to be the man that comes home everyday and ask how the day went, to give her the back rubs she’s always asking for- I want to be apart of her life. 

Thank you for reading. I know it’s a lot.

9nr6xy,16,2018-10-13,Confused by my fiance's reaction to BDSM and how to proceed,throwaway199810,BDSMcommunity,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/9nr6xy/confused_by_my_fiances_reaction_to_bdsm_and_how/,"Hello! Throwaway because fiance browses reddit.

We have been together for 6 years, but started being poly last year. When we talked about becoming poly, his main goal was just to be with other girls and get more experience since he was a virgin when we got together (and I supported, since he is not particularly good at sex imo and i thought it would be a good confidence boost). My goal was also to try to date girls, since it was something I had really missed. Im sure he saw that as an advantage, since he has always been one of those guys to push for 3somes. But over time I realized that I really enjoyed BDSM and I felt it was something I needed to explore. 

I was very nervous telling him that I was into BDSM. I got scared admitting that I had joined Fetlife to try and be a part of the community, and he didnt have a great first reaction. But since then he has done a course correction and been supportive of me having a profile there, even making his own so that I could link them together and he will log on occasionally just to love my pictures.

However, one issue has really bothered me. A few months back (June?) I returned from an LD internship and moved back in with him. When I got back, I was going through a really bad breakup, was broke af, and just at a very low point. So when he suggested we start to foray into BDSM together, I was excited. I would hopefully have an outlet for all of these pent up emotions. 

We started to play lightly. He was doing all the right motions, but to me he just didnt seem interested. I talked to him about this and he got very defensive. He insisted that he was into it. That his kink was watching me get off, so if BDSM is what I wanted, then that's what he wanted. I tried to explain that that isn't how it works. I can tell the difference between him doing what I want, and him doing what he wants. It's the difference of roleplaying a sadist vs. being a sadist. (Anyone else know what I'm saying? I'm not crazy right?)

He asked me how I knew that he wasnt interested and that he wasnt actually a sadist. I couldn't come up with a good answer. I just felt like the chemistry wasnt there. He said that I was trying to fit him in a ""vanilla"" box and wasnt supporting him in his journey of BDSM. So I tried to support him. We sat down and wrote a short, one-month consideration contract to go into effect a week later. I tried to teach him what I knew about BDSM. I made a list of articles and resources for him to look at. 

Then, when it came time for the contract to go into effect, I had to fight him to do anything that it entailed. He complained about having to spend money on a collar. Confused the hell out of me by going back and forth between asking me which one I liked and also lecturing me to not tell him what to choose because it was his collar that he was gifting to me. He never gave me any chores to do, even if I asked him if he needed anything done. He started toeing my limits that I had our entire relationship. We fought a lot at first. But then our communication went to shit because he started treating me like a dog instead of a girlfriend/sub. Any time I did something that inconvenienced him meant punishment that often didnt line up with the ""infraction"".  Plus with all the shitty stuff I had going on, I didnt have the strength to fight him and he often times made me feel worse. It was honestly the worst month of my life and I very seriously considered suicide to escape it all.

After I got to a better place mentally and the contract ended, I told him that this isn't how BDSM worked. That just because I wore a consideration collar didnt give him permission to treat me differently than he had before on a regular basis. He seemed genuinely confused. He said that he thought this was what I wanted. I asked him if he read any of the material I gave him? He said no. This pretty much confirmed my suspicions that he was not actually interested in BDSM (or what I wanted) and I decided that I definitely did not want to renew the contract.

I never actually told him that I didnt want to renew it, I just dropped it, and it seems like he has too and life has gone back to normal for the most part. Should his reaction to how he treated me during the contract be a red flag, even if I decide I dont want to practice BDSM with him ever again?"

I woke up late and cooked breakfast today, nothing fancy, just fried noodles and egg. I use coconut oil for the egg which gives it a flavor that reminds me of the cookies from kampung areas. I don't feel so tired of cooking this time because the kitchen is nice, you can see yards of the outdoor area from here and the neighbor's chickens roaming about. The electronic stove is nice too because there's none of that weird smell you get cooking with gas and the emanating heat. 

I feel so cool today, like there's nothing is wrong with my life, and I'm not afraid of the future, I don't know why.  

I feel cool like a glass of iced tamarind juice on the table under the scorching sun.

Maybe it's because of the gradual mood improvement from being well rested every day, because now I finally have privacy in the bedroom and a nice bed and airconditioning and my own work desk. 

Maybe it's because people at work are starting to talk to me like a friend.

Maybe it's because my internship is ending and I don't feel so pressured and confined anymore.

Maybe it's because I finally got in touch with the inner me that has been left forgotten for so long. 

I asked Miss Saf what should I do if I don't know what to do with my future, and she prescribed me a song to listen to, and of course, I already know that song. It was my favorite back in high school. ""What will be, will be.""

With the busy city streets and the honking and honking, and the unpredictable weather these past few months, and the violence and political and economic turbulence on the news lately, and adjusting to life as a worker and being independence at home, life has been so hard that I stopped appreciating the simple things in life. 

Maybe, you know, maybe I don't have to worry so much to the point of being paralyzed. 

Maybe life could be simpler and maybe happiness is a choice. 

Time to stop listening to sad songs on repeat and chill. Just relax. Enjoy life. And make fun of the things that try to ruin our days and laugh at them.

Here it goes:

**Avengers: Infinity War**

* The film is 11/10 GREAT!!! But I think they reserved the retrieval of the Power Stone for a certain character's backstory. But, if I have to add something in this movie, it'd be an extended version of the universe's POV of the Snap. Include former places/planets visited by the Guardians at GotG Vol. 2, namely Contraxia, where some drinkers/customers are bantering then suddenly it's stopped because one of them started to 'disappear'; The Sovereign, where High Priestess Ayesha starts to evaporate, and she hurries and try to enter a chamber to maybe save herself, but failed to. Camera pans out to reveal that the chamber is next to or in line with Adam's now-opened chamber. No actual appearance of Adam Warlock, but it'll hint that Adam is alive; The Kyln, where, after Thanos' attack on Xandar, left the remaining Nova Corps to defend themselves and try to contact Xandar. Same scenario as Contraxia, one guard sees a prisoner turn to ashes, fellow prisoners are startled as to what happened; lastly, Berhert, filled with animal life, starts to disintegrate into ashes; and Sakaar, no real politics here, just a view of some alien life disappearing, thinking that he/she is dying. 

This added scenes hammers home Thanos' irrational logic, since innocent plant/animal/alien life (as seen on Berhert, The Sovereign, Sakaar), some planets/places don't need to adhere the finite resources logic Thanos thinks everyone needs. Hell, the Sovereign is a candidate to this, they don't procreate normally as humans do, so they control the population and only creates new 'gold people' when 'old gold people' die. Sure, Earth is currently experiencing the problems that Titan encountered, but not all planets are far from that problem or solved it even.

**Spider-Man: Far From Home (and the potential of Disney Play, or DisPlay) -** a rundown of Norman Osborn, what he's been up to, all in a neat 5-episode miniseries aptly titled **Osborn.** Directed by Vince Gilligan. Starring Bryan Cranston as Norman Osborn. (I only chose Cranston cause the dude can go to maniacal psychopath to composed villain within seconds)

* ***Hell Is Other People (******The Wilson Connection Part 1)*** \- The Norman Osborn anticipation in this subreddit is ON POINT. Just like J. Jonah Jameson's inclusion in some form. But, if I were to write Mr. Osborn as a recurring antagonist, I'd put him on ALL the relevant places in-universe-wise. My best inclusion for him is he funded or spearheaded the FALCON program from way back when Sam Wilson was still in USAF (?). He's trying to replicate the Stark tech (flying, navigation, yada, yada), but wants to stay away and be called a 'copycat'. Unlike Justin Hammer who created droids in Iron Man 2, Norman Osborn tests the political side of things by befriending military officers and, like Hammer's intentions back in IM2, ""have a seat at the Pentagon for the next 45 years"". Hammer, now caught at the end of IM2, spouts on camera that Osborn has plans, too. (Hammer's a douche, we should know that by now). Osborn and Oscorp in general is under-surveillance. This time around, Sam came home but his friend didn't, died during combat. Osborn is in a bad light and succumbs as the Chitauri invades New York. A smart person, Osborn, along with a 10-year old Harry, escapes and waits out the invasion in an island far away from the fight. In that aftermath, Oscorp was badly hit, and in need of financial backing to get back at its feet, he was approached with a proposal from Aldrich Killian, something about being **the power, and the fear** to control the country. All of AIM Industries becoming a subsidiary of Oscorp (funds, research, sitting money) and in return, a seat at the table (Pentagon) if Killian's plan goes well. Norman Osborn declines, saying that Killian is a lunatic, saying that he doesn't need that. Killian exits and we see his POV. He failed to make Osborn the 'fall guy' in his plans and recruits Trevor Slattery.
* ***Only the Best (The Wilson Connection Part 2)*** \- Now, we know that Oscorp funded the Falcon suit in hopes to recreate or replace the Iron Man suit. In the military's eye, the attempt failed, they cut ties with Oscorp and the project was shelved. It's star pilot out of duty. Osborn laments that if he adhere to Killian's plans, he'd be in jail like Hammer. He is proud enough that he owns Hammer Industries as a subsidiary of Oscorp, where he makes his 'precautionary weapons' (Judas Bullet from Luke Cage was really Osborn's idea. Making it under Hammer Industries will be traced to Justin Hammer). Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Sam knows that he needs to help Cap anyway he can, but he knows a better way. The Falcon Suit, now stored on an Oscorp facility in which Sam knows, was later used to help Captain America for the Triskellion Battle. Remember that? Well, Norman Osborn was called up and he gladly gave it to Sam in hopes that his best 'pilot' will give him the good word to Captain America and be rewarded with the right foot inside the Pentagon. At that time, SHIELD is in a delicate place, as to why Sam borrowed the suit. Norman Osborn knows this through his connections and sees it as an opportunity. SHIELD is saved, he is backhandedly responsible for it; SHIELD is dismantled as revealed as a corrupt organization, he can accuse Sam Wilson as a thief who stole the suit and get him killed. What's another soldier dying in battle?
* ***Crimson, the Color of History-*** The Avengers, Norman's savior, looms over his head. In the aftermath of Winter Soldier, Black Widow leaks all of HYDRA and SHIELD'S files online. Norman instructs a certain intern, a thin looking Tinkerer? Either way, he instructs that all of the files be downloaded and cross-examine, to find anything useful. He learns that he was part of the Project Insight (HYDRA), a potential threat. He ponders on this, because why would a straight white-collar man who tries to solve the world's problems be a potential threat? After discerning more information, he learned that he was saved and must make a public statement on this, claiming that he was beyond grateful about the Avengers. But decides not to... Because, he saw that most of what SHIELD keep tabs of him was his borderline and questionably legal actions within the company. But all of this, the files, the new and old information at his hands and he still longs to be the one to spearhead the Avengers, but with a few caveats. He resents but agrees to run for Mayor through the advice of his board members as he grooms Harry Osborn into taking the business someday. Cut to, one year later, This time jump makes him cling to political power to level his playing field in the years to come. The Avengers obliterated a FREAKING country!! He no longer aspires to be one of the Avengers, he aims to be better than them. This time around, the Tinkerer, close to his look in Spider-Man: Homecoming, can make a propeller out of old blueprints leaked from Winter Soldier. Norman sees himself as someone who is evolving, someone who treats the Project Insight threat as a wake-up call of sorts. 

He readies himself as he meets with Darren Cross, CEO of Cross Technologies, to discuss the capabilities of the Yellowjacket suit and the Cross Particle's (Yellow Liquid) properties, in hopes of partnering with them/their company. As he descends from his limo, partially embarrassed that he was late, Osborn was astounded when a tank came crashing from the fourth floor of the building. Minutes later, the whole compound ( Pym Technologies ) disappeared into thin air... 

* ***Calculated Chaos*** \- (Before Civil War) Norman Osborn goes home, rattled with what he saw. He feared that all of what he built can wither and die in seconds. A world full of powered people, and he, who built everything from scratch, feel powerless. A few days later, he has a breakdown, scolding Tinkerer in the process. We shift to Tinkerer's POV, as he stole most of his tools from Oscorp's building and a has been providing ill-conceived weapons to The Vulture. A few weeks after that, the Tinkerer burgled the remains of failed projects, along with the Falcon suit from Falcon's paramilitary buddy who died in action(stated in Captain America: Winter Soldier). Witnessed that on a CCTV footage, Osborn follows him on his own, arguing to himself that if these bad guys aren't smart as him, he'd be in jail, his reputation tarnished. He encounters a certain Adrian Toomes at the old warehouse where he ditched Spider-Man to die in SM:HC (fOreShaDowIng) who's about to sell to an unnamed buyer shrouded in a cloak, a mechanized 'stolen flying suit' that the Tinkerer outfitted with propellers. This 'stolen flying suit' is now a rented one. This retcons (or should I say, enhances) Spider-Man Homecoming. Vulture finds buyers through Oscorp's connections, and Osborn provides ""junk"" equipment/suit prototypes that The Tinkerer and the Vulture can sell them, too. This connection would explain why they got contact with other villains and was the first to the site and not Damage Control. The Vulture's crew experienced a lavish lifestyle under Osborn's money, salvaging what they can and bringing them home to play/sell with. *But, The Vulture wants out of this negotiation because Toomes' believes that if shit hits the fan, his crew will all be killed, and he doesn't understand as to why Osborn wants them to sell these without taking a cut. Toomes' doesn't know what Osborn's end goal is, and that scares him.* So, one night, they invade his bedroom and threatens to kill Osborn. The Vulture asks to get out of this negotiation. Osborn doesn't negotiate back, implying that they were free to go whenever they want from the start. He just wanted to know the works. He lets Toomes into his plan, a group so sinister it can take all the superheroes out and be replaced with. Toomes witnesses the dark side of Osborn and bails. Osborn laments to Toomes that the Avengers doesn't respond if it is below them, if it doesn't make them look like superstars. This is what's wrong with them, they attack whenever they want to. ""That's why I am manufacturing chaos, Mr. Toomes. To prove the world that I am right all along!""

The next morning, to further take them apart from the informal negotiation, Osborn announces that he is running for Senator. He scheduled a press conference saying that powered people have had enough, states that recent attacks throughout the city came from powered people, unbeknownst to the viewers that he manufactured almost all of them. The slightest idea he spouted out of sheer pride that he survived Vulture's threat with only his mind amazed him even more, solidifying that he made the right moves all along. News spreads out and he was credited as one of the powerful politicians that birthed the idea of the Sokovia Accords. 

* ***Errors and Misjudgment (The Wilson Connection Part 3) -*** (Infinity War and A4 Aftermath) A known politician who is running for senator is suddenly catapulted into the limelight because of his idea that powered people need to be put in check. His past failures are now viewed as heroic attempts to level the playing field. His failed EXO Falcon Suit program wants to be a must in training for aspiring pilots entering the academy. He continues to keep tabs of the connections Toomes, he saw names like Gargan, Burch, Von Doom, and took interests in certain SHIELD files he kept from way before, such as Ava Starr, Samuel Stern, Justin Hammer, Bill Foster, a zealot named Baron Mordo, the now captured Adrian Toomes,, the captured Baron Zemo, Emil Blonsky, as well as Trevor Slattery, who disappeared at Seagate prison. He reviews them from time to time, but was reluctant to approach any of his colleagues and his board members because it feels like he is betraying himself for forming his own team instead of doing the right thing, enforcing the Sokovia Accords to help the civilians. He was tasked to visit USAF with Harry Osborn, after the attack of Cull Obsidian and Ebony Maw. On the way, they talked about what Harry experienced in his life, how a certain Spider-Man is both a superhero and a small-time hero. Norman Osborn sees it as an act. They arrived at USAF, without a Lt. James Rhodes to escort them, he uses this to explain to Harry that these powered people feel like god, they can't even meet people like us. He passes upon a suit named ""Mark 3. The Iron Patriot."". They stopped at the suit and said, ""If that lieutenant is proud of being an Avenger, why can't he be proud of his country and wear this?"" . That same night, he endorsed Wilson Fisk as the rightful Mayor of New York City (AS SEEN ON THE DAREDEVIL SEASON 3 TRAILER). The next day, he is briefed that intelligence reports that Wakanda, a newly opened state, is under attack from alien forces. He took this as an invasion on Planet Earth. He stares blankly through a window and ponders that if these 'aliens' do succeed, what would he become of himself. This is an entirely unexplored species to him, he won't be able to rise to them even if he becomes President. He was abruptly stopped when he saw Harry, ""Dad, dad, what's happening to me?"" as Harry Osborn slowly turns to ash, Norman Osborn failed to hold him till his son's last breath..

**PURE SPECULATION FROM HERE ON OUT:**

**After Avengers 4, we are introduced to Norman Osborn in the big screen, we will know him as a villain of Spider-Man, but his backstory will only be hinted** ***so little*****. This Norman Osborn is now a President. He will be the poster child of the USA, a President wearing a suit of armor coated with red, white and blue, and being present physically on the matters that's most important to the country can only win so many votes. With running mate Thaddeus Ross winning vice presidency, they formed a new group, the Thunderbolts...**

Like for the past three weeks there has been an fight between them and when I came from my internship, I saw my mom's face and could already tell what happened, he hit her.
And this isn't the first time either. I do my best to help my mother and currently I'm the cummunication between them which means (Say this to your mom or say this to your dad).

But when they say it, they're saying it on such a shit tone that I either just ''suck it up'' and be like ''calm down theyre both just angry and mom is just stressed out and more''
But lately I just got really enough of it and can't control my own anger, stress and annoyingness.

And when I try to help my mother, she just snaps at me ''Mom, do you need help?'' ''NO!'' and then 5 minutes later asking for help.
Or when I just wanna talk about situation A, she just ditches it and goes about situation C, D, E and so on.

My father, I barely talk to him. It's just ''Say this to your mother!'' or ''How was college? fine? ok.''
I never really have a conversation with my dad besides college, work or ''future''.

Yes, my dad is a controling person. In no way I correct his actions but he stays my dad and he has done some good things as well.
I just wish, he would 'Man The F- Up'and stop using his hands against us (especially stop towards my mom).

Like I have no clue what to do after I graduated from my study. I wanna keep on studying and get more diplomas for my future but that means living another 4-5 years at home.
My parents and I'm getting so sick of living at home with parents, like for real our living situation isn't healthy and it never has been.

9nt1we,1,2018-10-13,Account intern interview,Sewaqk,interviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/9nt1we/account_intern_interview/,So I have a interview at a regional council for accounting intern position. I have no clue as to how I should I prepare for it. Any tips welcome
9nten0,31,2018-10-13,Your wins for the week,morncuppacoffee,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/9nten0/your_wins_for_the_week/,"Feel we need to spread some positivity on the sub!!

What were some of your wins for the week?


Our census has dropped a lot over the past several months. Mostly for GOOD reasons like clients moving on to better things. However, I've been receiving pressure obviously to get the numbers back up. Had a great convo with the regional person about this and she actually validated how great my program is and she doesn't think it's anything I'm doing wrong per se. She also said that she hopes we aren't thinking of closing or anything because our program is really needed in our area.  It was nice to hear because I often get negative comments from other providers for NOT taking people who are not a good fit for our program.

A day later I ended up getting a new referral too who sounds like they will be a good fit.

There is a challenging client who comes to me once a week. A lot of colleagues don't like her and feel like my sup is bending over backwards too much to please her and her family.  I haven't had the easiest time with her so far either. Fast forward I've had the best session with her this week and found out some really cool things about her that are huge strengths we can use moving forward in her treatment.  I found out she is an amazing singer so we are going to use this in her future sessions.

A couple of my interns surprised me with one of my favorite snacks yesterday!!!

I also am trying to focus more on self-care during the week vs. cramming it all into the weekends. I signed up for a yoga challenge this month to help in creating a new habit.  I made it to the yoga studio 3 times after work this week.  Only reasons I missed the other days were because I had an evening client one night and yesterday I had to come home to help out with some house stuff we've been dealing with because of all the rain.

I also have NO PLANS this weekend.

9nu1gr,3,2018-10-13,Me (M21) got a new job in ex's (F21) city. Do I tell her?,SharpMaintenance,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9nu1gr/me_m21_got_a_new_job_in_exs_f21_city_do_i_tell_her/,"Sorry for the long post, but I feel background is necessary. TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Roughly a year and a half ago (March 2017), me (M20 at the time) and her(F20 at the time) met through a mutual friend. However, we lived 8 hours away from each other, so we decided that a relationship probably wouldn't work. After talking all summer, playing games together and visiting each other a few times, in August we decided to try to make things work for the last two years of college.

&amp;#x200B;

Every month I would go out to see her or she would come see me and it was alway the best weekend of the month. When we weren't together, we would always be on a Skype call or texting each other, plus playing video games together when we both had time. I truly thought that I had found ""the one"", but then in March of 2018, right before a trip out to see her, she said that we needed to take a break. Her reasoning was because school was stressful and she wasn't sure if a relationship was best for her emotional state at the time. Of course, it was devastating for me, but I quickly realized that no matter what, I wanted the best for her, so I agreed. During the break, she ended up dropping out of college due to this emotional lull (but that is beside the point). After a week or so, she explained that she was sorry but we needed to break up for good, then proceeded to cut off all contact from me (but did so in a civil way, she's not crazy lol).

&amp;#x200B;

What she didn't know was that I had a suprise announcement for her when I was going to see her that week. The news: I had just accepted an internship in her city, so that we could spend the entire summer together. So, after the breakup, I was faced with the awkward challenge of deciding if I should tell her that I was going to spend the summer in the same city as her or just keep it on the dl. After a long debate with myself, I decided that it would be best to tell her, because then I may be able to at least spend some time with her (I still love her and think I can ""win her back"" at this point). This turned into a brief coffee meeting in which she only wanted to discuss in detail why I was there and to make sure that I understood that she did not want to be in a relationship. Understanding her argument and still caring about her greatly, I spent the entire summer in her city, without trying to talk to her, because that is what she wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

Since that coffee meeting, I have yet to talk to her, but here is where I need your help fellow Redditors and relationship gurus: the company that I have interned with is offering me a job to start within the next few months, so do I tell her that I am about to move and work within the same 5 miles of where she lives? Being a city that I don't know many people in, it would be beneficial to at least have her as a friend, however, I don't want to make her uncomfortable. Due to proximity, it is also likely that I might run into her or her parents, which could make for an even more awkward situation. I still care for her greatly, but I do not expect any form of serious relationship to happen. So do I tell her or stay in the shadows?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Met this girl, fell in love, she broke up with me, got a job offer in her city, do I tell her I am moving there?"

I am currently a computer science student from Germany entering the 5th semester of my Bachelor's degree. I thought about going to Japan for a year or two but didn't want to ""just"" take a vacation there but to do something in my field of study, like working, doing an internship or my master's degree there. After a lot of research over the last few days I feel a bit overwhelmed with information. My impression is that all oppurtunities come down to having money to be able to afford university there or having exceptionally good grades to get a scholarship. I have none of that, my grades are not terrible but not that good either. I wanted to ask about you guys if someone was in a similar situation and managed somehow or someone that knows about oppurtunities I could give a shot. What I imagine to be something I could realize is moving there for 1/2 years with a job/intern paying good enough to cover all the expenses or something similar.

9nuday,12,2018-10-13,LoVs knew student quirks during USJ? (Tsu traitor evidence?),HeroAcademiaAllLight,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/9nuday/lovs_knew_student_quirks_during_usj_tsu_traitor/,"Something that generally seems to be accepted, is that the LoVs didn't know the quirks of the students, when attacking the USJ.

But wouldn’t it make sense to put Midoriya in the flood zone, so if he uses his quirk, he’d break his bones, and unable to swim, he’d drown?

And wouldn’t it make it difficult for Mineta to immobilize the villains, if he can’t stick them to the ground?

Also, Kurogiri is fairly intelligent, could he really not tell that the girl, who is meant to have a fairly frog-like face, and frog themed costume, has frog powers?

The short of it is, I think there's generally some reasoning behind where the students were placed.

\\\\\\\\\\

Kurogiri is probably the most capable villain that was there, given Nomu not being able to think for himself. He seemed largely untouchable before, and a short while after spreading everyone.

Kurogiri took out 13, who could’ve been a serious threat to the thugs.

As much as Ida manages to get outside, his and Sero’s mobility would be tricky to deal with, and in some areas, they might be able to help others escape from their zones much faster. Moving them out of his sight, might make it harder for Kurogiri to stop them escaping. Ida suddenly coming into view at full speed, or Sero simply being able to pull himself up over the railings at the entrance, would be hard to deal with.

Shoji’s perception doesn’t really help him with Kurogiri right in front of him, and his and Sato’s strength, would be hard to utilize against an observant Kurogiri, but would potentially be a huge issue for the thugs.

Uraraka would have to touch Kurogiri, again, hard to do whilst he’s paying attention to her. Also, when she does touch him, he seems to still be able to move downwards. Also a big threat to thugs.

Ashido might’ve been a serious issue for the thugs as well, though not an issue for Kurogiri with his warp gates. I̶m̶a̶g̶i̶n̶e̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶o̶n̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶r̶o̶w̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶a̶c̶i̶d̶ ̶a̶t̶ ̶p̶e̶o̶p̶l̶e̶,̶ ̶h̶o̶w̶ ̶m̶e̶s̶s̶e̶d̶ ̶u̶p̶ ̶w̶o̶u̶l̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶b̶e̶?̶

In the collapsed buildings, it’d be too risky for Bakugo to use his larger explosions.

I'm not sure about Kirishima, but it may also have been theorized that his quirk might increase his weight, which could be an issue in the likely unstable buildings. If he reverted to normal, it wouldn’t help much whilst being crushed by the buildings, where as in the flood zone, he’d be able to swim up.

For the landslide zone, maybe they hoped Todoroki would slip, after freezing the uneven ground? Or it may simply be, that this was one of the easiest zones, and he's here so his powerful quirk couldn’t help his other classmates.

Hagakure also apparently got sent to the landslide zone. Given she was the only other person sent with Todoroki, it may be that the plan was to hope Todoroki wouldn't notice her, and freeze her. Kurogiri seems to not have enhanced senses, so if she’d stripped down fully, she might’ve been able to sneak past him.

The mountain zone. Momo, Jiro, and Denki, at the very least all have low(er) mobility, and this was one of the furthest zones from the entrance. Given their versatility, they may’ve been moved for this reason alone.

The fire zone. Likely meant to wear out Ojiro. He'd be running around, fighting people, surrounded by fire, and with his massive tail, which probably consume a lot of oxygen.

Given how everyone was dispersed, (and that Shoji said that all the students were in the USJ,) It’d make sense that Aoyama was here, though I’m not sure why, and if he may not’ve even been here, not much point in thinking on it.

That just leaves Tokoyami and Koda in the squall zone. We learn later on that Tokoyami’s dark shadow is weak to light, as much as it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume an ability named “dark shadow,” would be weak to light, they might not've placed Tokoyami in the fire zone, given Tokoyami’s quirk, doesn't appear to cause him any physical exertion. Potentially being a very powerful quirk, placed in an area that probably didn’t have as many villains (given they’d have to deal with the fire too).

Without having an effective plan against dark shadow, it might be that they placed Koda alongside Tokoyami to act as a burden to him. Seeing as Koda only seemed to be baiting villains for Tokoyami to sucker punch them, and as it seemed Koda didn’t do much in the battle trial arc, it would make some sense to place him here. Or, given the Squall zone seems to be the darkest, though unlikely, maybe they knew how dark shadow could lose control, and rampage.

/////

Obviously, the conclusion I’m working towards here, is that Tsu seems to have been placed into an area where she’s strong, one which Kurogiri could likely tell she’d have an advantage in, where as all her classmates were in locations that made some sense. It’d indicate that she is/was the/a traitor, is that so?

Possibly the best argument against this, would be that during the USJ, it appears Shiguraki tries to kill her, and is seemingly only stopped by Eraser Head's quirk.

So it’d seem pretty unlikely Tsu is the traitor, but not necessarily impossible.

Though the argument could be made that Tsu was just a disposable pawn, I think it might be more complicated than that.

But first, it seems Shiguraki was trying to kill her, and if he wasn’t, how’d he seem to know about Eraser Head’s erasure?

Shiguraki spent some time observing Eraser Head before fighting him, and also had his quirk erased. It could be that he might’ve felt it, or there may even be another reason he seemed to know Eraser Head was using his quirk on him.

But why did he reach out to Tsu? Let me deflect, and ask, why only her? He could’ve attempted to grab Midoriya, or Mineta. He has two hands, why didn’t he go for the double kill, at that time?

My best guess, is that either, if she is the traitor, she could simply be a helpful hostage, or that it’s part of the reason she’d be the traitor. I’ll explain my thoughts on the second point.

Tsu is referred to as ""the perfect pillar of emotional support,"" by Recovery Girl, and at this time, Shiguraki was shown to be incredibly childish and erratic.

Shiguraki might’ve simply been attempting to grab her, to have her help things turn to his advantage. Though certainly it seems convoluted, there’s two reasons I think the viewer is meant to see this. Firstly, it obviously makes it hard to believe she’s the traitor, secondly, the way it's shown. We see Midoriya’s dread of Tsu being killed, in a very dramatic way, but think about how it was when Bakugo was attacked by the sludge villain, or when Uraraka was going to be crushed in the entrance exam. They weren’t shown as dead. It seems like it was made exceptionally dramatic, when it could’ve been simply handled with, “If he touches her… She’ll disintegrate!”

The best reason I can think of for this, is that we were meant to dread her being killed, so we’d care about her, most likely, so we’d care more when we found out she’s the traitor.

I haven’t re-read/watched everything after thinking about this, so there may very well be flaws with this. Plus I haven’t watched a lot of anime, and Hero Academia (including Vigilantes,) is the only manga i’ve read a series of.

However, I’ve already rambled a lot, so I’m going to 𝒕𝒓𝒚 to be more brief.

She becomes much more significant, not only during, but also shortly before the USJ arc.

She starts insisting Midoriya call her “Tsu” after the battle trial arc. They’d only known each other for, I think, 2 days.

She points out Midoriya's quirk is like All Might's on the ride to the USJ. Shiguraki has been told All Might would be weaker, something All For One would know happens when One for All is passed on.

Besides the dread scene, Tsu has also had the very emotional scene of her crying after they move on campus. It also was related to why we haven’t seen her room.

The 2nd OVA also largely focused on her, possibly to build up her appeal, as we see her family and a friend of hers. (People have theorized that it may be related to them being hostages in future.)

She has quite a few interesting speeches as well. She talks about trust early on, and tells her classmates that trying to rescue Bakugo would be them acting more like villains, than heroes.  Though this isn’t evidence, it sets things up nicely for hypocrisy, and irony. (Is this  l̶o̶s̶s̶ irony?)

When attacked by Toga, she makes the very reasonable point that Aizawa told them they could use their quirks to defend themselves, not to beat the villains. After Midoriya, Todoroki, and Shoji show up, her reason to not purse Toga, is because ""We've still got no clue what her quirk is!"" Though not an invalid point, it's still rather odd.

She could have any frog-like trait as a quirk in future, which is fairly strong. She already has mobility, range, and stealth. Though, we do get to see her “learning” camouflage, it could be that she had it previously. Either way, it’d help her sneak about.

it's also odd, that even though Toga had an opportunity to get some of Tsu’s blood, she didn’t. Weirder still, Tsu didn't attack Toga. If she can jump really high, isn’t that because she has powerful legs? Even if we argue her tongue was injured, and that Toga was holding her arms, why didn’t she kick? (Maybe Midoriya not thinking about using his legs isn't that weird at all.)

During her internship, in the hero killer arc, even though it’s just one panel in the manga, we spend over half an episode watching her, and her only inner thoughts are “adorable”, “ribbit,” and “ribbit, ribbit”, telling us almost nothing about her thought process. We don’t even get an inner monologue during an intense hostage situation.

She has an exceptional poker face, and her habit of replying “ribbit,” can make you unsure what she’s thinking.

As /u/Za_wardo said to me, &gt;!""A little side note, but in chapter 138 we get two statements that the Yakuza knew that the raid was going to happen. First is Overhaul apologizing to the boss for the noise and the second is when Rikiya smashed through, the police wonder how he knew that the operation was happening. That would point to the traitor being on of the kids involved in that operation. So Izuku, Ochaco, Tsuyu or Eijiro.""!&lt;

During the break-in, (when the media breaks in,) we see Izuku, Ochaco, Ida, Denki, and Eijiro in the stampede.

It is possible that one of the League snuck in, but we were told that UA has sensors throughout the whole campus, and given Hound Dog, (and potentially other staff,) having heightened senses, it'd be a pretty big risk for the League to enter.

If Izuku, Ochaco, and Eijiro were in the stampede, the only student out of those mentioned we can't account for, is Tsu.

But why help out the other students? Well, her motive isn’t made clear from this. Could be protecting her cover. Could be she wants to be a hero, but is being forced to help the league.

I will note, though, given All For One seemed to be aware of Midoriya having One for All, and given how AFO seems to care about OfA, this might be part of why she helps Midoriya, at least."

We’ve been dating for a year and half and he has always been uncomfortable with the fact that others find me attractive, even when I reject them immediately and block them. He’s not one to openly talk about his feelings, which frustrates me but we’re working on it. 
He is taking his first actuarial exam in about a week and hasn’t been studying enough for it, despite me reminding him. His roommates only encourage him to go out and drink with them instead of focusing on this exam. It’s so hard to watch him disregard this really important test that could determine what kind of internships he can get and when he can graduate college. It stresses me out a bunch, and it stresses him out a bunch, which manifests itself into him getting angry and me and starting fights with me. He will get overwhelmed and then find something that happened in the past to get angry about. When I remind him that we’ve already talked about said problem and moved past it, he just becomes more upset. 
I’m frustrated that he’s not setting himself up to succeed, and I’m even more frustrated that he’s taking his stresses out on me. He is my best friend and I don’t want to lose him or see him fail. This feels like a sinking ship and I am hoping this will all end after he takes his exam, but I am scared to wait that long. "

I'm a student at the point where I have to find an internship to work at.

I am about to send the first email to a company but I'm not sure if I should continue sending mails to other companies as well since I'm scared that if they take a long time to end up saying ""no"", that I'll have to start sending mails and visiting again which will take more time.. Which in turn might result in another student ""snatching"" the other internship places (we can only have one student from our school to each company)

But if I do send multiple, I'm not sure how to explain that even though they might accept me, I might not go there after all...

Sorry if this is a weird worry but I'd like hear the advice from you guys.


edit: Thank you everyone for answering my questions with so much advice and details! "
9nv428,4,2018-10-13,[IDEA] The Silph league of Pokemon,pablopang,TheSilphRoad,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/9nv428/idea_the_silph_league_of_pokemon/,"With all those changes announced by Niantic and an interview with one of Niantic employee we are all pretty hyped because is thought that, maybe, PvP will come soon.

This will give us a great opportunity to change the way we play, we will probably be able to challenge our friends while waiting for the raid to hatch and this feature will probably have the same resonance as the raids feature.

But we as a community will have an even greater opportunity: we already have, thanks to u/dronpes, a great tranier social network that let all of us have a contact in every city we go to raid, trade or simply go for a walk. With PvP we could make all of this even greater with an official Silph league of Pokemon. Let me start with a little introduction.

**INTRODUCTION**

In the original series (both the game and the anime) the Leitmotiv was the possibility for the trainer to explore the world wandering from city to city capturing Pokémon and challenging other trainers. In every city there was a gym with a gym leader (often the strongest trainer in the city). After beating that gym leader the player would have received a medal and after a tot of medals could have challenge the Elite four (the best of the best). This aspect of the game is obviously lacking in Pokémon Go: yeah there are gyms but very often you will find here to battle you a pidgey or a demotivated Blissey...yeah you get a medal from the gym but to get the valuable one (the gold one) you have to stay in the place for a lot of time and if you leave soon after, you have literally zero reason to get a gold medal on a gym. With PvP and the Silph league this could change.

**THE IDEA**

My idea is to integrate the Silph league with a ""Gym system""...every community need to choose their gym leader (maybe with an intern tournament, but this could be simply in the hands of Community leaders). After the gym leader is choosed the trainer has the ability to design and assign their personal medal. Also in the community page of the Silph league every trainer can see what trainer is the gym leader and ask a PvP meeting with him (because we can't be in a gym all day waiting for little 10 year old kid to come by to kick our...Pokémon) and if beated the gym leader will add the medal to the trainer profile.

**BUT WHY?**

Well there are a few reasons to implement this idea: first of all I think will be super fun and some more hardcore players could really start a real Pokémon adventure. Second of all this would gather a lot of people to the Silph league: right now I have, personally, a lot of difficulties to let people join the Silph league...it's cool and if you are already a part of this community I'm sure you love as much as I do your trainer card. Also this could give us the wonderful opportunity to create the Elite four during live meetup of the Silph league.

What's your thoughts on this idea? Do you see any problems with it? Let me know your opinions."

For patients outside of the ICU/medicine patients, my hospital typically uses Miffilin St. Jeor but uses stress/injury factors in addition to activity factors to estimate needs. I have not been able to find a ton of information about the use of the factors and the research I have found talks about them in the context of other predictive equations. I talked with the other interns in my program and most of them said they do not use stress/injury factors and many of them use kcals/kg at their hospitals. One intern said they use Harris Benedict with injury factors occasionally for specific patients.  I have also discussed this my preceptors who basically chalk up choosing the factors to ""clinical judgement"" but I am hoping for a little more guidance... 

Are other interns being taught to use stress factors with Miffilin? 
Do any of the practicing RD's use them?  Do you have any resources or charts that suggest which ones to use? "
9nv6ij,17,2018-10-13,[Scheduled] Something Wicked This Way Comes Ch. 23-27,tippytoesnmonkeyjoes,bookclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/9nv6ij/scheduled_something_wicked_this_way_comes_ch_2327/,"Hold on to your butts folks. Crazy stuff is about to go down at **Cooger and Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow-Show**. You ready for it?

Ch. 23 
Last we left off, the not-Nephew had framed Will and Jim for theft, and taken off running towards the Carnival.  Jim sprints off after him, with Will running after *him*. Will thinks to himself that he surprised the not-nephew by chasing him, instead of waiting for the police.  He realizes that Cooger is running to the Carousel in order to try and age himself again. As they watch the Nephew climb on, the boy-man reaches a hand towards Jim. Seeing Jim react with desire towards the now-forward-moving carousel, Will tackles him. The boys tussle, and Will attempts to turn off the carousel.  Distraught, Jim tries to stop him - “*But Jim, behind, babbling, tore at Will’s hands. ‘Will, you’ll spoil it! No!’”. *
 
Will (for the first time really) actively fights back against Jim.  The two boys continue to fight, as Mr. Cooger continues to ride around the Carousel.  Will cries out that he thinks Mr. Cooger will try to kill them when he gets off and Jim replies that Mr. Cooger wouldn’t kill **him**.  (Pro-tip, if that’s your friend’s response to that fear, he’s not a good friend.  End of PSA.) Will pulls the handle to the carousel causing the ride to go even faster than before, losing control. The resulting blast knocks the boys to the ground, and they watch in horror as the carousel continues on it’s forward trajectory.  Mr. Cooger tries to fight the centrifugal force of the ride, but falls and bashes his head on the hoof of one of the horses. As the ride continues to spin out of control, lights come on in the surrounding tents, but strangely no one comes out. The control box to the carousel finally bursts, and all the lights go out.
 
The boys slowly approach the carousel to find Mr. Cooger, now upwards of 130 yrs old - mummified and horrible, but somehow still alive. (Side note: Bradbury describes him as “puling”, which is like a thin whimpering/wailing sound akin to a newborn, which makes the whole thing more awful for me. Ugh. Bradbury uses sound (or lack thereof) to carry tone a lot in this story, but especially in this chapter.  “*He brayed.” “The calliope howled, boiled steam, ran ancient dry, then played nothing, it’s keys gibbering as only chitterings…” “He was alive, puling like a babe…” *) Will is sick, and the boys take off running away from the carnival.
This is the first time that Will acts openly against the will of Jim, and defies him to the point of physical violence. **Why do you think that this is the first thing to spur him to action, rather than simply following in his wake?**
 
**Jim makes a point of stating that Mr. Cooger wouldn’t kill him, but doesn’t seem to think about what would happen to Will.  In this scene, it is Will (who represents boyhood and innocence) who acts the most “adult-like”, and Jim who acts rashly and selfishly. What do you think Bradbury is trying to say about adults vs. children?**
 
Ch. 24
 
We again see the imagery of the white moths fluttering against a light as the boys run to a phone box. Together, they call the police about what happened.  In a short while, Will and Jim return to the carnival with two policemen, and two medics from an ambulance. As they reach the carousel, they see the body is now gone, and Jim yells to Mr. Cooger that they brought help.  As he yells, the lights in the Freaks tent flicker on, and the tent flaps flutter in a sudden gust of wind. Entering into the tent, they see all the Sideshow characters in the tent, including a dwarf that Will thinks looks vaguely familiar. Mr. Dark stands on a stage, tattooing his palm. The boys see creepy-mummy-Cooger strapped into an electric chair. The boys insist that is the man they were talking about, and he had indeed been dying.  As the sideshow freaks gather closer, Will realizes with horror that the dwarf is the Lightning Salesman, who has somehow been smashed down into what is now a dwarf. Mr. Dark tells them all that they were just in time to see the carnival rehearsing their new acts. The policemen tell him that the boys thought they saw a man dying, and Mr. Dark dismisses it as the fear of boys. He introduces Mr. Cooger as “Mr. Electrico”, and that as part of their act, 100,000 volts of electricity will pass through him.
 
Will sees that Mr. Cooger is dead, and yells for it to not be allowed to happen, but Jim defends Mr. Dark saying telling Will that “It’s all right!” Mr. Dark throws the switch and the body is immersed in the light of blue electricty.  In the noise and light show, the boys are the only ones who seem to notice that Mr. Dark is yelling “Come Alive”, that everything in the tent seems to be saying “Come alive!”  *(Sidenote: that song from Greatest Showman suddenly got a **whole** lot creepier. )* As the lightning subsides, the old man in the chair opens one eye. The sideshow freaks begin to breathe for him. Mr. Cooger tells the police that he saw the boys sneak into the tent and decided to scare them by playing dead. The policemen seem to think it all a good show, and prepare to leave. Mr Dark gives boys free tickets, and asks their name.  Both Jim and Will give a fake name and run out of the tent.
 
**Why do you think Jim speaks up in defense of allowing Mr. Dark to go on? He speaks up right as the policeman goes to examine Mr. Cooger, thus stopping them from getting the proof they need to believe the boys.**
 
**Both Jim and Will understand that Mr. Dark has targeted them and will most likely enact some kind of revenge on them. Both boys express desire to bring Mr. Cooger back, but do they have the same reasons?**

**This chapter serves to again illustrate the difference between the children and the adults.  Once again, the adult policemen and medics seem clueless when Mr. Dark begins shouting. Will attempts to shout over the lightning as well, but no one is able to hear him.  Considering the continued comparison between youth and old age, what do you feel is being told to the reader through this moment?**
 
**As they leave, Mr. Cooger “knights” them, and says *I dub thee….asses and foolsssss...I dub….thee...Mr. Sickly...and….Mr. Pale…!”* What do you think he meant by that?**
 
This is one of my favorite chapters in the book, and so deliciously creepy. Bradbury’s use of descriptive imagery is amazing. “*For now, very slowly, as if roused by thunder, as if the electric fire were new dawn, one dead eyelid peeled itself open.” “The dessicated bellows refilled, then pin-punctured the swamp-air out in faint wails:...” “The old man husked out syllable on syllable. ‘Ha.’ Pause. ‘Ha.’ Pause ‘Ha.’”* I can’t wait to see what happens next!
 
**Start of Part II**

Ch. 25
 
Miss Foley, alone in her house,thinks about how a few years prior, she noticed that “her house was crowded with bright shadows of herself”, found in the mirrors of her house. She ponders what to do about Will , Jim, and the nephew (Mr. Cooger). Somehow she knows that something is wrong with the nephew, but she knows that it will be all right when she goes on the ride he wanted her to go on. He warned her away from the mirror maze, and told her that she needs to ride the carousel. She understands that throwing her jewels was a way to get rid of the boys who would try to stop her from using her ticket for the carousel, where she will find happiness. She wants to do something to make sure they do not interfere in the future. Miss Foley calls the library and asks Charles Halloway if he will meet her in the police station.
 
**What do you think about the fact that mirrors already seemed to haunt Miss Foley, even before the carnival came to town? What does that tell the reader about the purpose of the mirror maze?**
 
Ch 26.
 
On the way back, the ambulance pulls up next to the police car and one of the interns says that he thought the old man was dead. The police think he is joking, and in the back of the police car, Will and Jim are talked over when they try to expound. They get dropped off at two random houses close to the police station but do not go in. Will sees that Jim still holds his tickets for the free rides, even though he threw his away. Will wants to tell the Police Chief, or someone higher up about the carnival, but Jim convinces him that they have no proof. They discuss the Lightning Salesman/Dwarf, and Jim thinks that it would be all right if they could apologize to Mr. Cooger. Will explodes and begins to yell at Jim. He cannot believe that Jim is not afraid, why he does not seem to understand the danger.  * “Ulmers! Goffs! ...You need a two-ton safe to fall on you?...Ain’t that enough to scare the Jesus out of you, Jim?” * He even thinks the disappearance/death of Mr. Crosetti has something to do with the carnival. Will argues with his friend, telling Jim he does not really want to be older, but Jim does not agree. Will points out that Jim will leave him as soon as he is older, and that he is glad the machine does not work anymore, and Jim is angry with Will for destroying the machine. Will responds that when the machine is fixed, Mr. Cooger will certainly return for his revenge, and says that he’ll only come for Will since Jim will have “gotten in” with the carnival and given up Will.  Jim assures him that that wouldn’t happen, but their argument ceases when they hear voices nearby and stop to listen. Miss Foley is talking to Will's father about the break-in at her house. After a few moments of speaking she asks where the boys are if they are innocent. Will jumps up and climbs through the window after he hears her question.
 
**Why doesn’t Jim feel the same danger and urgency about the Carnival as Will? **
 
Ch. 27
 
Mr. Halloway walks the boys home. He will not wake Jim's mother as long as Jim promises to tell her first thing in the morning, and he lets Jim go home. The boys have secret iron rungs that they nailed into the ivy to make ladders up to their rooms. Charles Halloway briefly reminisces about being young and then talks to Will. He knows that his son is innocent, yet wants to know why he admitted stealing at the police station. Will tells him that Miss Foley wants them guilty for some reason. He starts to tell his father everything but then for some reason cannot. Will promises he will tell his dad in a few days.

**Lack of communication between the old and the young, particularly between Charles and Will is a running theme so far. What stops Will from simply telling his father everything?**

9nva7g,0,2018-10-13,M4F Cuckolding Your Husband With A Boy Stud A Third Your Age,freeusestud,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9nva7g/m4f_cuckolding_your_husband_with_a_boy_stud_a/,"This is a prompt directed at all the women of dpp who are a little more experienced. By that I mean, you’re not the tight assed college coed you used to be. You’ve been married for a while now, and have the stretch marks and slightly sagging ass to prove it.     
      
Things weren’t always this way. You can remember a time when just walking through the door used to give your husband a hard on. He used to come up behind you as you rummaged through a drawer, and press his crotch against your ass as he reached around to mash your tits together. 

Send back then was more fulfilling. I mean, you used to look at yourself in the mirror as you fucked and think  l*damn, we could be pornstars* as you watched your husbands firm muscular back move as he plunged his throbbing 26 year old cock inside you. 

But things have changed. Your tight toned thighs are less so, having never really gotten back into shape after the first kid. Instead of coming up behind you to grab a feel, he’s tapping you on the shoulder to ask where the tums are, his heartburn getting the better of him. 


On the rare occasion you do have sex, he’s always tired, and it’s a quick sorry affair. After he pulls out of you, ten strokes after entering, you lay back and sigh, unsatisfied, with his cock barely doing much more than get you frustrated. You might even sneak off to the bathroom to play with someone who’s become a friend over the years: your detachable showerhead. 


Now that the kids are all off in college, it’s even worse. You either putter about an empty house, or come home from work to a house with just you and your husband, with him asking you for help putting in his new anti fungal cream. 

But one day, that changes. Maybe it’s the new neighbor, a 16 year old boy living off a trust fund. Or the high school intern at your corporate office.  Or maybe even a new trainer at the gym, the young junior quarterback. You joined a year ago, hoping that you getting back into shape would spark something in hubby, but nothing. He barely acknowledges your new, tighter abs, or realizes that your ass is firmer than it’s been in years. 

But this new man, he notices. You start to feel deja vu when he looks at you. The desire in his eyes reminiscent of earlier days, when you could walk down the street and know that every man in sight was looking at you like that. 


So, that’s my idea. To be clear, I’m not looking for a one off wham bam thank you ma’am here. I want to build a story. You aren’t going to throw twenty years of marriage away for a quick fling, you’re going to make me work for it. Maybe at first we have a frantic make out in the janitors closet, or the gym after hours. But slowly I’ll wear you down. You’ll end up coming to the gym, knowing that as soon as everyone else leaves, you’ll be peeling down your tight yoga pants as I dive between your sweaty legs and lap away at your musky pussy. Or getting on your knees beneath your own fancy oak desk and trying to get your nose to push against my pubes as you deep throat my cock. A cock, by the way, that is bigger than your husbands ever was. 

Then the clincher. The day you invite me to your house. I show up around noon, and make my way up to your room. You’re sitting in your bed in a lace negligee, laying out on satin sheets as I enter. We spend hours making wild love, interspersed with slow, passionate sex, the kind where we look into each other’s eyes and cum together, in a wave of physical and emotional pleasure. 


The time passes by without us noticing, that’s how engrossed we are with each other’s bodies. It happens during a particularly animalistic session, the fourth time we’ve fucked that day. I have you pressed against the wall, your legs wrapped around my back as I bounce you on my cock, your pussy juices, mixed with the previous loads I’ve left inside you, running out of your pussy down my balls. Your husband walks in, horror etched in his face. Instead of you jumping back and crying excuses, you tell me to go ahead, which I do. In front of your horrified husband, I come deep inside you. My balls clench as I blow my hot potent load inside you, overflowing your gash. 

Well then, I had a lot of fun writing that. If you sympathize with this character, or just like the idea, I’d love to see if we can work out some sort of roleplay together. I can’t wait to see your messages. "
9nvlfs,3,2018-10-13,"We [28F, 24M] got to spend two weeks together recently, but now that I'm home again I feel like we're drifting apart and I need help.",FTFY_bro,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/9nvlfs/we_28f_24m_got_to_spend_two_weeks_together/,"I'm finishing up the last year of my doctorate degree, and he works long hours. My schedule is very rigorous, with very little flexibility to move things around. I planned all of my work hours for this last year of my schooling down to the week, just so I could make time for us to fly and visit each other. 

Before my visit, things were going really well - we were both really busy, but we were able to make time for each other and even when we couldn't talk, we were really in sync. My visit to see him went amazingly well. We bickered a little bit, but it wasn't anything serious, and I almost expected it, since it's difficult to try to fit a relationship into 2 weeks. 

Leaving him this time was more difficult than it has been before, and he didn't handle it with a ton of grace. On the day that I was flying out, he spent a bit of time pouting and as a result, we didn't get to spend our last hours doing something fun. I don't really begrudge him for it, everyone handles stress differently, this is just mentioned to set the stage for the current difficulties we're facing.

I flew back last weekend, and am back at work. For the last week, my schedule has been a little more relaxed, while his has been crazy hectic (12 hour days all week, and he's working this weekend too). I called him on Monday and tried to set up a gaming session, since that's how we typically spend time together. He agreed, but then changed his mind because he didn't have his headset at home. He said we'd do it the next day instead. The next day he canceled again because he had a busy day at work and he was tired. Since then, we haven't done anything significant together. He hasn't even really spoken to me on the phone - I've called him a couple of times, but he's always too tired to talk, and we ended up spending most of the short phone call in silence or fighting.

We've had a couple of fights in this last week, which is really unusual for us (we hardly ever fight). He started a fight earlier in the week, and I started one yesterday. I feel like he's not making an effort to even connect with me. I know it's not because he's being malicious or that he doesn't really care, but he tends to live his life with blinders on, and I'm usually the one calling him. I'm really anxious about the state of our relationship, since we've gone from hardly ever fighting to fighting constantly in the last week. I feel like he's pulling away from me because he doesn't want to fight, but I'd prefer to communicate about what's going on between us. The problem that I see is that he is working so much that he doesn't have the time or energy to invest in having this conversation with me.

I'm trying to ride out this difficult time by giving him some space, but it's really difficult when I send him messages in the morning and I get read receipts but no reply. I know he's not the best at communicating, but even a short response would suffice. I can generally let his terrible texting habits go, but since I'm already in a heightened state of anxiety about his lack of communication, I feel like I'm spiraling.

A few other things that might be adding to the current stress of our relationship:

* He just found out that his workplace has changed their holiday vacation policy, which means we won't be able to see each other at Thanksgiving, and likely Christmas as well. This means our next visit will be in March, which is ages away.
* I'm heavily considering doing an internship after my doctorate, which means that I *might* get posted to a region that isn't ideal for him to move to. If that's the case, it means that we'll have to add another year to our separation timeline. If I do an internship, I'll likely be working 80 - 100 hours a week, which is also not ideal for us to plan time together.

TL;DR Boyfriend and I are struggling in the post-visit aftermath. I want him to spend more time with me, but he's been really busy at work.

**Can someone help me reframe my thought processes? I know he cares about me, but he handles stress very differently from me, and when he pulls into himself while I'm reaching out to him, it makes me feel lonely. I just need some perspective and maybe a gentle slap on the cheek.**"

This past summer I learned how to code, learned a bit of web development, javascript &amp; frameworks and solidity/eth ecosystem through Udemy. I am in a leadership position at my business school's blockchain club. I am graduating this year from a business school with a Finance Degree. However, I am not pursuing any options in Finance and want to get into Software Development as a career. I don't think my Finance degree is relevant and I think finance careers will be disrupted in the near future by various Emtech.

I currently understand some technical jargon and what tech stacks Eth devs are using, have been obsessed with crypto, and read The Internet of Money, but I want to gain deeper working knowledge which will get me employed.

I am thinking of sharpening my general computer science knowledge through reading certain books, watching Harvard CS vids on YT, sharpening up Node.js, React.js and Solidity and completing CryptoZombies. But i need more ideas! :) I would call myself right now a novice amateur, but want to get to beginner and then intermediate and somewhat competent.

Any eth devs have any ideas of what I can do to gain deeper technical expertise, sharpen my experience and knowledge with smart contract/blockchain development? Since I don't have a CS degree and I don't have too much experience with web/blockchain dev and 0 internship experience in dev, how do you guys recommend I progress? Do you think I should try to get into a web development job for a few years first?

I see alot of Eth/ERC-20 development going on and various things that I can participate in through Github. But I don't think I am competent enough to begin bug bounties in smart contract auditing, developing on certain crypto projects, etc. I guess I am asking how do I progress from novice developer to employable developer and gain working knowledge in this space? I have done certain Udemy tutorials and other CS learning but I feel a knowledge gap that I need to bridge before I start populating my Github, working on Opensource, and ultimately applying to blockchain dev careers.

If you’ve been here and gotten out of here, I would be so grateful for your advice.",biggestcuckalive,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/9ny4lk/ive_got_low_self_esteem_and_am_clueless_about_how/,"So it’s becoming imperative to build my self-esteem for many reasons. One of them being that my low self-esteem is causing intense anxiety about applying for internships, another of them being that I want to be a good role model for my (eventual) children, and the last one being that I’m turning 20 and really don’t want to spend my 20s feeling inferior to everyone else.

About me: I’m 20F, in a very prestigious college, doing above average grade-wise not at the top. I get compliments from my teachers and friends all the time, about my appearance and my work abilities, but I sadly realized that I don’t believe them at all. 

I don’t want to sound petty but it’s incredibly disconcerting to look at yourself and see something completely different from what everyone else says. 

Yesterday a sales associate at Aerie told me I had a nice body. First I felt nice, but then I realized I didn’t believe her. Then I wondered if she was lying to try to get me to buy. Then I felt ashamed for thinking that at all, because she seemed kind and genuine and my own poor self image had led me to doubt a completely innocuous bystander. 

That hurts. But the thought that I am exactly as I think myself to be hurts. So I’m stuck in a grey place. 

I need to get to a place where I believe my friends, believe my teachers, and reward myself for my hard work instead of beating myself up about why I’m not as good academically as the people better than me. I don’t know where to start. I do have one good quality though: I’m very strong willed and will not give up the fight against my anxiety and self-esteem issues no matter how bad I feel. I’m ready to get better. Too much is at stake. Please give me some advice if you can relate. 

Many thanks to anyone who took the time to read this post."

In addition, I was not apart of ROTC in high school and college.

I am not sure what career opportunities I have on the table, and would like to reach out to the reddit community for advice/tip, before visiting a recruiter. Someone told my I can try to go in as a officer, or start from the bottom. He also said coosing between active duty and reserves is another option.

I'm 26 years old and I've been interested in construction and have dreamed of starting and owning a construction company since I was a kid, I went to college and got a degree in Civil Engineering, and I started working for a large heavy highway construction company after my first year of college. I started as a laborer, took a semester off to work, kept coming back to the company during summer and winter breaks as a laborer and then an intern until I graduated working my way up to become a full time field manager managing crews and subcontractors while also learning a lot of the project management side.  I have moved up in the company much quicker than most, gained a lot of strong relationships and respect from most higher ups, get paid pretty well with good benefits (gross \~$85k), and have a very bright future with the company, but I have that itch to do my own thing.

I want to go into the grading and excavation construction business.  My construction market is currently hot, and there is work all over the place.  I would start off doing small and simple jobs (mostly as a subcontractor on bigger projects) with a crew and small equipment and work my way up from there.  I have a decent amount of contacts with smaller and similar companies in the area that did work as a subcontractor to me in my current company.

I know the work from the field and business side and I am pretty confident I can obtain the necessary funding to get off the ground.  Unfortunately, I cannot start the business while working at my current company because I already work 12 hour days 6 days a week so there just isn't time.  I am single, own my own house (well I have a mortgage), and have student loans (that I'm paid far ahead on), but other than that I don't have any other expenses (other than living) and I don't really have anything else to lose.

I have been thinking about this all year and have planned things in my head and have gone as far as taking and passing the tests for my contractors license.

My question for you guys is, should I take the dive?  What advice and considerations do you guys have for me to either do it or not?  And how can I get over my fear of going out on my own, taking the first step, giving up the good job I have now that has a lot of future potential, and turning in my two weeks notice (if I should)?

9nzeid,6,2018-10-13,"When you found out you had OCD, did you feel a kind of grief when the initial relief of being diagnosed wore off?",Iwantajobfromsomeone,OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/9nzeid/when_you_found_out_you_had_ocd_did_you_feel_a/,"**This post was a little long, but it was cathartic and hopefully someone can relate or it helps someone who might be in a similar situation.**

So basically, I'm a 22 year old college senior and was just diagnosed this semester. I've known for a while that I probably have OCD, but it wasn't official until about 2 and a half weeks ago. 

My earliest memory is being absolutely terrified that if I stepped on a crack I would break my mother's back, and if I did step on a crack I would get this horrible mental image of my mom being carried out on a stretcher. 

It took many other forms throughout my life as well. I went to Catholic School, and I became terrified that God would punish me for having sexual thoughts by killing my family. When I was 13 I was terrified that I was a pedophile because I had a crush on a girl who was 12. Whenever I walked, I had to end my steps on an even number otherwise I would feel immense and unbearable anxiety (I switched to odd numbers when I realized how ridiculous it was lol).

I also hated myself and the way I looked, obsessing over individual flaws that no one else cared about or noticed (BDD?). I avoided mirrors and my friends, and I isolated myself for a lot of my life. The friends I had either thought I was mad at them or was hanging out with someone else because I kept up a pretty good front, so they stopped inviting me to things. My family also ended up homeless after a very challenging series of events (this is another story), and I was very, very depressed. I started counting calories as a way to gain control, and I lost about 65 pounds by overexercising and eating less than 650 calories a day (I'm a 6'0 man, so this was dangerous tbh). 

Throughout all of this, my OCD waxed and waned in severity, even though it was always there. Everything culminated last summer and fall when I became terrified of having different mental illnesses. ADHD, bipolar, schizophrenia, autism, sociopathy, NPD, etc. I spent up to 7 hours a day obsessing and researching symptoms to make sure that I didn't have any of these. It was truly the worst period of my life up to that point, including being homeless when I was in high school. 

My school eventually funded me to do an internship abroad working at an NGO with refugee kids, and I made an active effort to get control back of my life. I stopped drinking, smoking weed (I used to do this daily), tried to fix my diet, and started to practice different therapy techniques that I read about on here. I got a lot better and for the first time in a while started to enjoy my life again. I was productive at work, had cool experiences, met new friends, and established a life in a foreign country where I didn't speak the language at first. I'm still truly proud of that experience since I was there for about 8 months. 

Fast forward to now, I'm doing much better. I made an appointment with my college's counseling center and my therapist referred me to a psychiatrist to try out medication. I've been on Lexapro for a little over two weeks now with pretty minimal side effects, and I'm starting to feel a difference. It's easier to practice the strategies and coping mechanisms that I've been working on for the past year, and it's allowing me to spend time with friends and get my work done in a meaningful way. It's kind of like when you're in a quiet room, and you don't notice the air conditioner in the background until someone turns it off. 

But now that I'm starting to work through it, I feel an immense grief. I've lost so much time, so many friendships and relationships, so much happiness, and so many opportunities to these thoughts that I know are irrational. My sophomore year I told my best friend (now acquaintance) that I couldn't live with him because I wanted a single room when I was actually terrified that he would see my compulsions or ""find out"" that I was a terrible person. There are countless examples like this, and I can't help but wonder how my life would be now if I had access to proper treatment and medication when I was a kid. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? How did you come to terms with it? I'm feeling very hopeful and much more capable now that I'm undergoing treatment, but I also kind of feel like I'm grieving. "
9nzs25,1,2018-10-13,My best friend (24F) in an unhappy relationship told me she finds me (25M) attractive and initiates a lot of physical contact. Occasionally she told me she doesn't want to send mixed signals all the while wanting more touching. Should I believe her words or actions?,Johnny_G93,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9nzs25/my_best_friend_24f_in_an_unhappy_relationship/,"This is too complicated for me to figure it out all by myself.

Background: We started talking in college sometime in March or February this year and quickly became colleagues. Both of us got a chance at an internship in the same place. We took it and we got in. She is in a long term relationship of 4 years but in last few months it has been really rocky.

Our relationship really picked up in June when the internship started. Since we live close to eachother we take our trips to and from work together. We eat breakfast and dinner together and talk a lot while at work. We quickly found out that we have in common a lot of things. Not only our views on politics, world and other serious stuff but also our hobbies and interests.

The relation between us started to get physical after we had started to have dreams about kissing eachother. While sitting next to me she tried to make sure that we were touching with our arms, legs, but not more. This is also the time when be became extremaly flirt. With time it naturally escalated and we both stopped faking that touching was accidental.

After one train trip home she felt guilty the next day and told me she doesn't want to send me mixed signals. Even though she isn't happy with her bf now she wants to be with him. I told her that I understand it. Trip home that day was marked by a long conversation in which I said that if I were to develope feelings for her, telling me all this now is a bit too late seeing how our internship wasn't even halfway done (it is 6 month internship). She said that I'm right and we admitted to ourselves that we find each other attractive and talked about our feelings.

For a while after that she didn't push for more flirting or touching but also didn't cut it back. She quickly got more comfortable again and it started to feel like she was literally glued to my side, even at work, which made me feel little unproffesional but we sorted that out. 

While all this was happening between my friend and I, her boyfriend got more controlling and jealous (not because of me interestingly enough). He even started to read her texts from a work colleague with whom she texted a lot. After she demanded privacy he made excuses and didn't change his behaviour. She went with it because she didn't want to lose him.

Last week it all came to an end. Bf found out about our touching and they almost broke up. My best friend unfortunately is a person of low self esteem (she admitted it to me herself) and while she is usually very strong and independent, she said that she wants to repair the relationship even though to me and other friends it is obviously toxic.

She is an adult and she makes her own decisions. It's not my place to pick her bf for her. With all that said I have developed feelings for her and would like to give us a chance. Our friendship is already over since when the internship is going to end, there is no way bf will let us have any contact. Seeing I have nothing to lose I wanted to openly let her know about my feelings and let her make a decision while there are no possible misunderstandings about what was between us. While I remember what she told me about not wanting to give me false hope I also remember her actions. My friends and I don't believe that with their intensity could be so baseless and we think that her decision might be motivated by fear of being alone. I'll never know for sure unless I'll come clean with my feelings and desires for her. Whatever her decision will be I'm going to recpect it and try to be as best of a friend to her as I can for as long as I can.

This is my story and I'm really looking for your input since I'm still not 100% sure what to do. Thanks.


TL;DR: Friend told me she is attracted to me and started to flirt with me and keeping physical contact whenever she could. Despite telling me she doesn't want to give me false hope she amped up the touching and flirting. Controlling bf found out, almost left her, and now she is willing to give up the friendship and some of her principles to stay in a toxic relationship. Best tldr I can do although I think the devil is in the detail so please read the story if you can. Thank you."
9nzwfp,3,2018-10-13,Former Practice withholding charts,romeosmilez,Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/9nzwfp/former_practice_withholding_charts/,"Quick Summary: Independent contractor in a shared space - offered the guy who runs the space to buy my practice (4.5 years), he refused - I pursued selling my charts elsewhere  (luckily I had 50% of my patients' charts). He has my other chart info on a flash drive for 30 days now and according to some of the staff/other docs, he does not intend on releasing my charts. NYSDental Association wants me to take him to small claims because they think he was doing some tax evasion and I should have been an employee if he wants to keep those charts. What other options do I have?

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I graduated in 2012. Worked around NJ and NYC. General practitioner with a bunch of specialty training. Like most I tried high volume at first, but unlike most I realized and took steps towards owning my own lower volume practice. Met this guy in Midtown Manhattan, 6ops who APPEARED to be nice and doing well. I took the word of the multiple other part time docs who had 4-6 year relationships with him. He ran his practice out of one room mostly and has part-time hygiene. Fees are very high so he said he always collected multimillions. The offer to join to practice meant I would build my own patient following and am compensated at 50%, he does refer to the other docs in the practice very rarely (I would be compensated a much lower rate), software, phonelines, staff and equipment are shared. He has pretty much has the office 70% empty and needed bodies. He dangled the carrot of learning from him, he would help in my growth, and becoming a partner/taking over and I fell for it. The agreement says I am an indpendent contracter and can take my patients (patients I bring in) with me if I decide to leave.

I started with 0 patients and committed one day/wk // after 4.5 years I grew a 275 patient practice (mostly PPO) which I spread out over 3 days. I even brought in another doctor (which the general rule meant I would be getting a very small % of the office's 50%). When It started dawning on me that over a period of 4.5 years that he actually refuses to teach (""I'm afraid of liability""), the practice (all the docs and specialists combined) collected $1.2M but he wanted to sell at $5M, and that he has to this day never suggested any marketing/growth ideas, I brought it up to him! He got pissed and said it was my mistake to expect to make a life as #2 in his practice without working elsewhere. I said it's sad that I could be #2 and his best partner/associate/renter whatever and am not happy at all with the low take home, even after bringing in another doc. I found a job in another city and it was booming and yes I sold out and became an employee but I'd be able to live a better life again. I did a part time split for a few months and then when he started treating me worse and worse, I told him I would leave (4 wks notice as per agreement) and he should give me an offer the patients.

Side story - FYI he runs an internship program through his office for college students and foriegn dentists - he charges the students a lot of money even though myself and some of the other docs usually end up teaching the most. These students sign up for a teaching/learning internship but they are actually the staff of the office - there is no professional staff! So his practice runs off these interns.. it's a nice gig but it definitely limits productivity and having to teach and not gain from his fees is annoying. The worst is when a student wants to go on a family vacation or gets into dental school; this owner wants the student to stay and train the next year's interns and if they don't he becomes childish and calls the dental schools and tries to get them unaccepted and throws tantrums. I dealt with things because hey originally I was gonna take over.

He said my PPO patients are worth nothing to him and he has no offer. I thankfully put out feelers a little before and had some offers, so even thgouh I was shaken I knew It HAD VALUE. Anyway he cursed me out and threw a tantrum and held one of my flashdrives with patient contact info. I said thanks for 4 years and that he treated me poorly and maybe when he calms down we can recreate a better relationship. He said GTFO. I laughed. He said he had to review my patient list and make sure I wasn't stealing patients, even though his staff looked over the inital list prior to download.

&amp;#x200B;

Its been 30 days since the 4 wk notice and he had the list. I have sent him gentle requets but his responses are still very mean and he shows he has no intent of doing so. He kept my patients on his software even after explicitly making me sign to claim ownership and that he should not be contacting my patients. My malpractice says I'm okay since no one is in active temps or ortho etc. NYS Dental association Legal team says he is a bully and says 1) because of the shared software and the setup I wasn't really independent and he was doing tax evasion or something 2) I should take him to small claims and he'll get scared.

His most recent email says he wants to be paid for the time to review the list (even though his schedule is empty- i know because staff shows me the schedule), but I responded with I'll give him until the end of the month and if he wants payments he should speak to the dental assocaition about it. I don't want to communicate with him anymore. I sold the 50% I had to a nice group across the street. My collection from it was obviously limited by what I had to offer and the background about an aggressive jerk withholding some charts. What should I do? I don't want to go to court against a person like this or ever. I was thinking about waiting until the time I had given him expires, then trying to file an official complaint? I won't ask for my patients and just suffer the loss maybe (even though I earned it and could really use it)? Does such a  thing exist?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to any and all.

If anyone reads this and finds a job in midtown manhattan, send me a message and we'll make sure you dont get screwed over also.

9o17fr,4,2018-10-14,I cheated 6 years ago...,TinySwim,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/9o17fr/i_cheated_6_years_ago/,"Usually posts about BPD and cheating involve the pwBPD doing the cheating. In this case, it was me who did it. It's been six years since I did it and I still hate myself to the core.

I'm not sure where to start.  I'll try to give a quick summary of the state of the relationship before my selfish decision. We were introduced at a queer (LGBTQ) party in college, where she and I (also a woman, but I'm bi and she's lesbian) met through a mutual guy friend. She was tall with dirty-blonde hair, curvy, athletic, intelligent, and witty. I was hooked. Our relationship slowly shifted from regularly hooking up to being monogamous. After a month or two into knowing each other, there were issues, which would continue over the course of the relationship. She would split a lot. Within a single hour, she would go from telling me that I should leave her alone to telling me how much she loves me and needs me.  She would threaten suicide multiple times or suggest I drove her to the point. She would ignore me and discard me. She would talk badly about me to mutual friends. She even threatened physical violence. I walked in on her harming herself multiple times after receiving her texts or calls for help. Why did I stay during all this? I loved her. As many of you have probably experienced, people with BPD are more than just their BPD behaviors. Those are the things that draw us to them in the first place. We had shared interests, and I thought she was funny. We did a lot of things together. I also just justified her behavior by excusing it by telling myself that it was okay because she had been through a lot in her life. I thought that it was normal for someone that had been through so much to experience to have those extreme behaviors, so I thought that I should be able to withstand them because A) I was fortunate enough to not have gone through the same awful things as she did and B) she seemed to and expressed need for my support. Looking back, I wish I had had enough sense to at least realize that the threat of physical violence was a reason to leave even if I pitied her.

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I don't think I was seeking self-validation in trying to be there for her literally all the time. I just think I took the whole treat others the way you want to be treated in a very wrong direction.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months before my cheating, we had an argument. I don't remember what about exactly but I know I responded to explain what I was mad about. Then, suddenly, as I was still talking, she started harming herself by hitting her head on the steel rail of her bed (it was a lofted bed, so the railing was at head-level and she was standing by her bed). Obviously, I was horrified and had to forcefully put myself in the way and pull her away from the bed. At that point, she fell to the floor. She didn't faint, she just drooped down, crying into her knees. I started comforting her, of course. I asked her why she did that. She claimed to have heard me saying that I didn't care about her. I was taken aback by that because I did not say anything remotely like that, which I explained.

&amp;#x200B;

Fastforward  a few months and I am on vacation with my family for a month before starting an internship in California. Over this month, my gf and I are constantly getting into fights with each, which included the typical verbal degradation and hate-filled tones. Yet, she would call me at all hours of the night because she was having some sort of anxiety attack (over things unrelated to us). Of course, I never really said anything because if I did, she would tell me that I didn't care about her feelings or was unsupportive. She did this during the school year too, ignoring any concern for my academics. In fairness, she would verbally acknowledge and say that I could decline if I didn't have time, but that felt disingenuous because she would continue to call me in the middle of the night VERY often. We had extensive arguments about that month, where she would often dismiss my feelings while asserting her feeling as reality. When I challenged that ""reality"", she would tell me that I was ""invalidating"" her feelings. In other words, I can set boundaries and experience the consequences or I can have her monopolize my time at the expense of my health and schoolwork. At one point during a phone call, i did break up with her. But almost immediately, she was like no let's work on this (even though she had expressed contemplating the same thing, which I am realizing may have just been one of those threats of discarding to scare you into submission). I don't know why but I didn't push back. I think I just figured she runs the show as she always has. I still look back at that moment with confusion. I was out and, within literally a second, I was back in. I did not feel I could do anything. I felt trapped. I felt she might kill or at the very least harm herself. If she was willing to hit her head on a steel rail after ""hearing"" me say I didn't care about her, could you imagine what she would do after her Favorite Person broke up with her? I didn't want to find out. And on top of all that, she could have started abusing drugs and alcohol as she had impulsively done so in the past to cope.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meanwhile, my ex-bf (who I had known prior to my gf and had remained friends with) and I were texting as he had started his internship in a city right next to the one I was going to do my internship in California. I started telling him about my relationship with my then-gf. This was the first time I had actually started to tell anyone because I usually don't like people knowing my business. I told him because we were still friends and he understood my feelings. I even told him about the fighting that had been happening all month long. While I clearly missed/ignored a lot of red flags, he didn't and pointed them out for me. It was like confirmation that I had suspected and ignored but didn't want face. I didn't want to admit to myself that the person who I loved more than anything was abusive. Fastforward to a few days before starting my internship, I am now in California for internship at Lockheed Martin' s Sunnyvale location. My ex-bf and I meet to hang out. He invites me back to his place to watch a movie. Then,  when we're at his place and we're setting up the movie. At a certain point, I'm having conflicting feelings. I kind of knew what I wanted but had been suppressing the thought because I was in denial -- I wanted to be out of the relationship with my gf and be with someone who treated me with as much decency as my ex-bf. So, I couldn't resist and just found myself throwing myself on him. I don't know what it was. Maybe this obviously fucked up behavior of mine was some fucked up way of crying for help. Though, maybe I am just a fucking awful person and piece of shit cheater. I definitely feel more like the latter than the former.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, this decision was the dumbest thing I could as I confessed to my cheating. What happens when you confess cheating to a person with BPD? The BPD behavior goes on steroids.  Before I cheated, I had already felt trapped, but after I cheated I found myself pulled and chained down to unimaginable depths. She became even more controlling than she was before. She rightfully considered breaking up with me but decided against it because she of how ""good"" I was to her. In retrospect, that was unsurprising because I was her FP.  I was suicidal for literally months long. I'm not kidding or exaggerating. Every fucking day was a nightmare both because I felt a gargantuan guilt and sense of worthlessness and because she would berate me every time we communicated, whether it was text or phone or in person. I caused her more pain than I think I have ever caused anyone else. I made her suicidal (something my not-so-smart self thought I'd avoid by NOT breaking up with her). I made her cry for hours on end. I made her depressed. She stayed in bed for hours every day. I made her feel more insecure than she had previously felt. I made her lose trust even with the person who she trusts the most. I made her angry. I worsened her anxieties. Needless to say, I did something so vile and disgusting to the person that I loved (even if I didn't want to in a relationship with her).

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, after I started seeing a therapist, I began to pay more attention to my gf's BPD. I had ignored it and never gave it the credit it deserved for many of the conflicts in our relationship. My therapist started points out the abuse to me. He pointed out the gaslighting, the devaluation, the discarding, the punishment, the gravity of the sexual coercion and violent threats that I had pushed aside (out of pity), threats to breakup, threats of suicide, the love-bombing, the provocations, and the walking on eggshells. After finally recognizing that there was no hope for significant change in her behavior (at least not for many years to come, if ever), I broke up with her. We've been broken up for 5 years now.

&amp;#x200B;

For the record, I have not cheated anyone ever since. I don't think I ever will. I couldn't imagine doing that to someone twice and not killing myself. It was asinine. If you're considering it, don't do it, regardless of how shitty you've been treated. It will not help in anyway. It's an awful thing to do to someone (even your abuser) and will not solve anything. I still think about it to this day. The lasting pain and lack of trust it must have caused her. The feeling of worthlessness hasn't gone away. I did something I thought I would never do and felt like I lost a piece of myself that I cannot recover. To be clear, I'm not sure what I expect in response to this post. Maybe I want to feel the full brunt of ridicule that I felt I deserved and still (to some extent) feel I still deserve. Maybe I'm looking for sympathy. Maybe I'm looking for other posters who can relate. I'm not sure. It's confusing to try to understand the reasoning behind all this with all these complicated emotions. I feel lost.

Which company boss likes to give a raise to employees? No one, right. However, this dude does his best to find a free-employee, searching for students that want internships, poor people from poor countries desperate to work like slaves for nothing, getting foreigners in to then tell them ""since this is your first job I cannot give you a full-time payment but you need to work as full time for us, yet your salary is really above average for first job in here"" - bullshit all over. It's so disgusting...

Aside from this, he is always showing off as much as possible how rich he is, bragging about all his Apple gear, buying the latest iPhone iShits in the market and then bragging out loud about it or about how he just got a new car (for the second or third time the same year!) etc

He seems like an alcoholic saying things like how much he needs and wants a drink, that water is poison and he is inviting everyone for drinks (sometimes free drinks!) on times like morning, lunch, afternoon, after work, night... everytime... really sounds alcoholic, I am not kidding here!!

And... he has a baby daughter and it comes to my mind everytime he is acting like a jerk like... wow... what a nice father...

Now he is keeping an eye on a colleague which is getting married because he doesn't want pregnant women of course! 

There are a few employees that seem like his bitch, always wagging their tails around him, being snitches just to get treats... fuckers. 

I told him I wanted to quit my job and he tripled my salary (I am not earning crazy loads of money, I was just receiving a misery for my job) and now he is my bitch because since then he acts like really carefully around me not to piss me off so I'll quit - I work in projects that no one wants to work and with the golden eggs clients. If I quit now, shit will be on fire. Feels good for exchange. "
9o1wfe,2,2018-10-14,My best friend (24F) in an unhappy relationship told me she finds me (25M) attractive and initiates a lot of physical contact. Occasionally she told me that she doesn't want to send mixed signals all the while wanting more touching and attention. What should I do?,Johnny_G93,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9o1wfe/my_best_friend_24f_in_an_unhappy_relationship/,"This is too complicated for me to figure it out all by myself.

Background: We started talking in college sometime in March or February this year and quickly became colleagues. Both of us got a chance at an internship in the same place. We took it and we got in. She is in a long term relationship of 4 years but in last few months it has been really rocky.

Our relationship really picked up in June when the internship started. Since we live close to eachother we take our trips to and from work together. We eat breakfast and dinner together and talk a lot while at work. We quickly found out that we have in common a lot of things. Not only our views on politics, world and other serious stuff but also our hobbies and interests.

The relation between us started to get physical after we had started to have dreams about kissing eachother. While sitting next to me she tried to make sure that we were touching with our arms, legs, but not more. This is also the time when be became extremaly flirt. With time it naturally escalated and we both stopped faking that touching was accidental.

After one train trip home she felt guilty the next day and told me she doesn't want to send me mixed signals. Even though she isn't happy with her bf now she wants to be with him. I told her that I understand it. Trip home that day was marked by a long conversation in which I said that if I were to develope feelings for her, telling me all this now is a bit too late seeing how our internship wasn't even halfway done (it is 6 month internship). She said that I'm right and we admitted to ourselves that we find each other attractive and talked about our feelings.

For a while after that she didn't push for more flirting or touching but also didn't cut it back. She quickly got more comfortable again and it started to feel like she was literally glued to my side, even at work, which made me feel little unproffesional but we sorted that out.

While all this was happening between my friend and I, her boyfriend got more controlling and jealous (not because of me interestingly enough). He even started to read her texts from a work colleague with whom she texted a lot. After she demanded privacy he made excuses and didn't change his behaviour. She went with it because she didn't want to lose him.

Last week it all came to an end. Bf found out about our touching and they almost broke up. My best friend unfortunately is a person of low self esteem (she admitted it to me herself) and while she is usually very strong and independent, she said that she wants to repair the relationship even though to me and other friends it is obviously toxic.

She is an adult and she makes her own decisions. It's not my place to pick her bf for her. With all that said I have developed feelings for her and would like to give us a chance. Our friendship is already over since when the internship is going to end, there is no way bf will let us have any contact. Seeing I have nothing to lose I wanted to openly let her know about my feelings and let her make a decision while there are no possible misunderstandings about what was between us. While I remember what she told me about not wanting to give me false hope I also remember her actions. My friends and I don't believe that with their intensity could be so baseless and we think that her decision might be motivated by fear of being alone. I'll never know for sure unless I'll come clean with my feelings and desires for her. Whatever her decision will be I'm going to recpect it and try to be as best of a friend to her as I can for as long as I can.

This is my story and I'm really looking for your input since I'm still not 100% sure what to do. Thanks.

TL;DR: Friend told me she is attracted to me and started to flirt with me and keeping physical contact whenever she could. Despite telling me she doesn't want to give me false hope she amped up the touching and flirting. Controlling bf found out, almost left her, and now she is willing to give up the friendship and some of her principles to stay in a toxic relationship. Best tldr I can do although I think the devil is in the detail so please read the story if you can. Thank you."

9o2cxm,14,2018-10-14,Being in Keto and social pressure,gocchisama,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9o2cxm/being_in_keto_and_social_pressure/,"I've been doing lazy keto since early September now ( selecting low carb food, but not doing strict macro on protein and fat) and be overall satisfied with the result. Still the weight loss is mostly water and i intend to take one step further (one meal a day, strict keto) when i consider myself fat adapted (not feeling hungry during long period of time. If i consider myself disciplined, i realized that the environnement is not keen to make things easier.

&amp;#x200B;

\- In supermarket and processed food in general, sugar is like everywhere, on every product. Organic is also pricey. I think it would be nice to take the ""price"" parameter into Keto diet plan that pop up here and here on the internet. MCT oil is good value but olive oil and medium price butter can do just fine.

\- I was in a restaurant, and intended to take a chicken salad and vegetables cooked in a pan. Unfortunately, there was a sweet sauce on it, and vegetables in a pan had added glutamate monosodium to make the dish thick. Even though you asked if there's sugar on their dishes, they say ""no"", but they see sugar as the white powder you put on coffee, and not the sweet sauce.

\- Going out for a friend birthday, they proceeded to toast with alcohol, and i declined because alcohol is carbohydrate (in a way). They argue that this is a one time thing and it won't budge your diet. ""toast on me!"" ""it's my birthday, celebrate for me!"" After few more decline, i am now an official party pooper.

\- People noticed my weight loss, and we talk about keto diet. Still, one of my interlocutor (med intern IIRC) lecture me on the issue that a heavy fat diet has on arteries and heart, that extreme diet are bad etc etc... It wasn't a conflict but i felt he wasn't trying to understand my POV, but telling me what to do from the ""right"" viewpoint.  

\- My mother is a diabetic Type 1. She eats rice every day (asian), pasta, etc. She has insulin power spike all the time (i can check her device) that build fatigue and dizyness. But when i started Keto and i explained to her it was related to insulin control, she was angry that i don't follow her ""eat everything moderately"" advice even though she's diabetic herself (then, being acknowledged in her disease). It creates tension inside the family.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we often portrays weight loss as a fight against yourself, and it is, but my post goal is to raise awareness on a uncomprehensive entourage. I'm not saying cut all ties with your circle, but to keep in mind that Keto is counter intuitive to decades of diabolization of fat and stay strong in following your diet. Even if it takes longer than others, it doesn't mean it's working.

I wonder if it happens to you as well, and if that made u cheat on your diet. Unwilligly it did for me (chicken salad with sweet sauce) and it didn't felt good.

We’ve been together for almost 7 years got married in June.  We graduated from college in September but haven’t been able to find jobs in our field yet and we’re staying at my mom’s house until we do. For our job we must complete a one year internship that isn’t allowed to have any significant amount of time off until its over.  We both really want children and hoped to start trying right after we got married. But now that has been put on hold until we can find jobs and are least 3 months in before we start trying.

 I’ve been trying to get prepared during this time, pinning what to stock up on while pregnant, making a mock registry list, researching midwives in our area, trying to get my hands on any pregnancy book I can find, listening to The Birth Hour podcast, exercising to try and get in shape, anything I can think of to keep my mind off of it but still be prepared. He has seen all of this preparation and it has gotten him even more excited than he already was.

 The problem is, he wants to start trying now. When neither of us has a job, a savings account, or a place of our own to live. I have tried and explaining and told him many times that no matter how much I want this there are things that need to be in place first. He every time responds with “other people get pregnant on accident and make it work, why can’t we?” It’s affecting our happiness and our relationship and ruining our sex life because he thinks there’s no point if we can’t make a baby. 

Has anyone experienced this or know what I should do moving forward?

Have your own F4F prompt that you'd like to pitch to me? Please do! Spot anything in my post history that we could amend to an F4F scenario? Let me know!***

-------------------------

Hi!

So, here's my first ever F4F prompt, and it's going to be a bit bumbling at first, but hopefully it makes sense by the end!

If you've read any of my past prompts, this one will very much take the same sort of shape - no specific, pre-written prompt, but instead a discussion of certain themes or elements I'd like to explore, to better facilitate a sort of.. brainstorming session, to come up with something better suited to both of us.

So! Without further ado, here's what I'm feeling today.

-----------------------------------------

***Lost, damaged, troubled girls.***

I just love some drama, inner-conflict, and some grittier themes. What I'm really looking for today is for one of us to play a girl that's lost in life, a bit damaged from previous experiences, or has troubled habits. 

* You know the type. Those lost girls that are in college or just out of it and have no idea what to do, who can't speak for themselves with any shred of confidence, who haven't quite grown up into confident, self-sufficient adults (but still legal adults!).

* Or those damaged girls, reeling from past experiences. Not growing up with a mother and having a bevy of mommy-issues, or terrible romantic or sexual experiences (I can't get any deeper than this without trigger warnings, which I don't want to issue in a prompt. Interested in this point, ask about it in PM). 

* And lastly, even those troubled girls - the ones that party way too much, that abuse drugs or alcohol, that shoplift or commit other petty crime, that can't hold onto any sort of stability in their lives.

***And the uniting theme here? They're going to be played opposite of a successful, confident, stable woman who is going to guide them along the right path, you could say. Of course, plenty of sexual care goes into that, too.***

------------------------------

***What're my preferences here?***

Ideally, ***I would prefer to play the older, successful, guiding, more dominant woman.*** I could play the other role, but this is indeed my preference. I'll write the rest of the prompt with that sort of assumption, that I'll be playing that character and that you, lovely potential partner, will be playing the lost, damaged, or troubled girl.

Other preferences? Age gaps! Secondary characters! World-building! Realistic pacing and development! Surprising twists and turns! Triumph and tragedy!

-------------------------------

***Possible scenarios?***

There are some that are immediately obvious, of course. 

* Perhaps this troubled girl has managed to land an entry-level job or internship at some sort of marketing or law firm. Things start off decent enough in the first week or so, but her issues deep down are starting to surface - work quality is suffering, other little behavioral hints. My character would be a far more established partner or member who takes a professional mentoring role towards the girl, and then eventually notices her odd behavior, and becomes the strict influence the girl needs in her life. 

* Similar kind of setup fundamentally, but with a different surface - a coach and her college athlete. Or a professor and her college student. I'm far more interested in the development of their taboo, secret relationship than I am in just random kinky sex (although, there can be plenty of that, but I want development with it, too).

* Incest? I'm into it, and it could work under certain circumstances. Perhaps a young girl who was given up for adoption as a baby searches for her biological mother as an adult - she finds her, reaches her, and attempts to reconnect. And, naturally, the girl has had a difficult life. 

* Another incest possibility would be between sisters with a bit of an age gap. Perhaps the younger one was still living with their parents and their parents died in a tragic accident, leaving the young adult (18-21) more or less on her own, and so her older sister takes her in for a while.

* Lastly, any of your ideas or suggestions! I'm just trying to get the ball rolling here and I'm really, really receptive to any and all of your own ideas, thoughts and suggestions! I want this to be a team effort.

***So, really, I'm looking for a cute, likely romantic tale between a younger, troubled/lost/damaged girl and an older woman with a spark missing in her life. There'll be struggles, difficulties, some life-coaching, rules, and plenty of D/s themed kinky sex.***

----------------------------------------

***Lastly, let's talk about kinks.***

* **Kinks:** I am a switch, with more dominant tendencies. I'm into things like roughness, hair pulling, light choking, spanking, light bondage, collars, gags, blindfolds, anal play (fingering, eating ass, toys, strap-ons, giving and receiving), orgasm control (forcing, edging, denying), toys, oral both ways, fingering, dry-humping/outercourse, age gaps, incest, sweat/musk (a big favorite), casual sex, informality, semi-public/risky, spontaneous sex, mutual masturbation, romance, affection, face sitting, dirty talk, sweet pet names, and so many more!

*Of course, none of those are required at all.*

* **Limits:** Scat, vomit, blood, extreme pain, bestiality, lactation, death.

------------------------------------------

***Some final notes!***

* I only write here on Reddit, through the PM's. Not chat. Don't send me chat invites.

* Yes, this is F4F. Guys, respect that. Today isn't your day.

* My message length varies, but you'll never get anything less than 4 lines out of me.

* I can write in first or third person, with a slight preference for third."
9o3a2n,1,2018-10-14,A bizzare case (not literally),Yuzujuiced,computers,https://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/9o3a2n/a_bizzare_case_not_literally/,"Hi, I’m in need of help as to why my pc would not turn on.    
My pc was working fine until one day, i come back from work and it just decides not to turn on. 
I’m currently interning at a computer building shop, and have gained ample knowledge of certain things. But this has got me and even my boss scratching our heads. 

**Specs:**    
PSU: Cooler master G650M    
Motherboard: asus prime B350M-A    
CPU: amd ryzen 5 1600    
GPU: galax EX OC GTX 1060 6GB    
SSD: kingston 120gb    
HDD: 1 tb toshiba    

Everything is a bit less than 2 years old except for the PSU, which i think is probably 3-4 years old (i got the pc from my friend’s friend, and i changed most of the parts)

**ISSUE:**    
pc does not turn on, no fans spin at all (not even PSU’s), only sign of life is motherboard’s lights. However, i brought my pc down to my intern spot, and it works completely fine there. 

**Things I’ve tried (that still doesn’t work):**    
- Taking everything out of the case to test run.    
- taking out the CMOS battery for an hour before putting it back in    
- using a extra 600W PSU i brought from the shop back home to test    
- cutting the power to my pc, then pressing the power button down for a minute or so    
- shorting the power pins instead of using the power button on my front panel    
- trying almost every single wall plug at home    
- using a new power cable    
- using a new wall plug extender (the ones that are linear and has like 4 extension plugs), everything else on the extender works ( router, monitor)    
- reseating everything    
- changing ram seats    
- **turning the power to my whole house off, and then back on**    
(Probably still tried some more things, u can state it and i’ll see whether i’ve tried it or not)

The **main thing is**, it works completely fine at the shop where i work at. This scratches off almost every single thing i could think of.

Few things i think could be the issue:

- There was a unannounced change in the electricity being supplied to my residence.
- PSU is somewhat dead (since the power supplied to my workplace is supposedly higher)"
9o3gw3,17,2018-10-14,"Final interview for first job, how do I negotiate without scaring them off?",grelondee,UKPersonalFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/9o3gw3/final_interview_for_first_job_how_do_i_negotiate/,"Hi guys, so I have a final interview at the end of this coming week with a tech startup. Its a few years old, around 30 employees, funded by a handful of corporate and private investors - they seem fine on the financial front though I don't know much about how this works. So far, I haven't been outright asked for salary expectation, and have maybe a year's experience total in this type of work from internships and projects. I haven't gotten this far in interview stages before, so not sure what to expect from this part of contract negotiation especially with regards to salary. I'm also in the process of interviewing with another, much smaller startup, who upfront mentioned that a generous salary + equity package would be on the table, with salary already being 5-10k more than what any of my friends are getting for similar positions.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the best way to proceed? ask them to match the second company (even though I don't know if they will give me an offer), or just not mention the other one at all? Is it appropriate to ask for equity if they haven't mentioned it as an option? Are there any questions I should be asking at this point?"
9o3hwx,95,2018-10-14,My mom called me a whore and then blamed it on my boyfriend,Hthrhrhhthrhrhj,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/9o3hwx/my_mom_called_me_a_whore_and_then_blamed_it_on_my/,"I've made a post about my mom on here before about a year ago, and honestly as time goes by I think she's starting to lose it.

Context: I'm 19 year old female who's currently in college. My boyfriend (21) and I have been dating since March this year, but this incident happened in the middle of August. I feed myself and clean up after myself. They had distant relatives over that I guess was my responsibility to entertain? I had an internship going and honestly I don't know how I would spend time with 60 something year olds. I was polite to them, but did my own thing.

I came home at around 10:30 one night from my boyfriend's house in the summer (basically summer vacation), and my mom absolutely lost it. 

Mom: ""This is not a hotel! You leave in the morning and then come back at late at night! You think we're your maids or something?!""

Me: ""I'm sorry I'm back at this time, but since it's summer and I'm on vacation, I thought it would be ok if I got to be out later.""

Mom: ""Well you're selfish! There were house guests over and you were rude to the guests we had over! You're never home! Who's going to clean up the house? You expect us to do all that shit? You might as well live somewhere else. (They don't do shit)""

Me (crying at this point): ""If you don't want me here then I'll leave!""

Mom: ""So you're going to be ungrateful and walk out of the house! Every single night you come back from BF's house! What do you even do there?""

Me: ""I don't understand! He makes me happy and I'm not hurting anyone. Besides, it's summer and it's vacation so I didn't think you'd have a problem with it! And he's the only person who you have a problem with me visiting!""

Mom: ""Why do you need to go there so often? What are you, a whore?""

Me: ""Why would you even say...""

My mom realizes at this point that she has no justification for what she just said.

Mom: ""Well he thinks you're a whore!""

The rest of the conversation happened and I went to be crying to my boyfriend about what my mom said to me. By the way, he's probably the sweetest human being I've known. I spend a lot of time with his family because they take care of me more often than my own parents do, and they're wonderful people. At this point, he's seen enough and he hates my parents, and after seeing what a loving family dynamic is, I hate them too.

I have a lot of other stories like this that span pretty much my entire life. It's getting worse each year as she gets older. One day I'm sure she's going to beat me and try and justify it, and I walk on eggshells to try and avoid that from happening (even though it'd be a blessing at this point).

And if you need further proof that this 'curfew' I had over the summer was bullshit:

A) I've gone to other male friends' houses and come back at 1-2 AM (for DnD) and they didn't care. They denied that when I brought it up but literally just last week we had another session and I came home at midnight.

B) The semester has started and because of the amount of work I have to do, I'm coming home around 11 EVERY night during the week, so no it's not about the time/school either.

This is more of a rant, but if you guys have any words of advice to help me cope I'd appreciate it.

Edit: A lot of you are concerned about me saying she might physically assault me, and I really appreciate it. I don't know if it's an irrational fear or not, but she has slapped me before (and my brother god knows how many times). I say this only because her behavior is going unchecked and it's getting progressively shittier; she might just feel as if she can get away with beating me cause no one would contest her/she would gaslight me regardless."

Which makes me super sad, because I like Jesse a lot, I love Jackson and his storyline with April and Mark, and I think Jackson could have been a very intereting character, like his almost sibling relationship with Mer is amazing, I'd love to see him develop a friendship with Alex more, and maybe take a mentee from the new interns? But rn, I don't even miss him, which just shows how disconnected he is from the rest of the story now. Anyone feels the same?"

The phone call was out of the blue the day after I had gotten back from visiting her for her birthday. It’s taken me awhile to get over her due to how abrupt and unexpected the breakup was.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I found out that she regrets breaking up and that she wants to get back together. I’m extremely torn up about it because I feel like she had no consideration for my feelings during the breakup and that by getting back with her I’d be throwing away all the progress I’ve made in getting over her. However, I do miss her a lot and have been thinking about her more ever since I found out that she wants to get back together. So what should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR Not sure if I should get back with my ex**"

9o7cn7,1,2018-10-14,"My (F22) guy friend (M21) lied to me, should I tell him I already know?",ambereyes96,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/9o7cn7/my_f22_guy_friend_m21_lied_to_me_should_i_tell/,"Apologies in advance for the long story but I’ve tried my best to simplify it by cutting out some of the juicier details. 
Last summer I did an internship at a great company, and made some awesome friends along the way. I became closest to “Brandon”, “Leo”, and “Sarah” while I was there. Brandon and I in particular realized we had similar tastes in music, and we were a few of the only interns not based at the headquarters, so we bonded. I even took a few weekend trips with Brandon, during which we had some deep conversations and got to know each other. Leo and I also became close, and took a vacation together, too. Sarah and I weren’t as close as Leo or Brandon and me, but she was still pretty cool. 

Brandon and I had to go to headquarters for an intern event and since he and I were in town, everyone decided to go out and get drunk. Sarah got particularly trashed, and began aggressively flirting with Brandon. At the time, only I knew that Brandon had a girlfriend at home (granted, they were on the rocks), but I kept my mouth shut. As the night came to a close, we all realized Sarah was too drunk to drive home on her own, so I offered to let her stay in my hotel room in the city for the night. Since Brandon was in my same hotel, the three of us took public transportation together and then ended up hanging out in Brandon’s room, where the two of them kept flirting. Long story short, I spent the night in my room alone, Sarah spent it in Brandon’s. 

The next morning, Sarah was VERY adamant that nothing had happened (not that I cared, they were both adults and had sobered up enough by then). Later, Brandon and I split an uber to the airport, and I mentioned that I respected him for not cheating on his girlfriend with Sarah (we both thought she was pretty hot, I think I said something along the lines of “You’re a better person than I would have been in that situation”). Brandon told me the same story Sarah had, and mentioned he was going to break up with his girlfriend. It seemed suspicious to me, but who was I to assume? 

Fast forward a few months, to the next time Brandon and I are back up at headquarters. Sarah pulled me aside at work and mentioned that things were weird with Brandon since he was stalking her. She told me multiple stories of times he’d “harassed” her. Unbeknownst to her, Brandon and I had just gone on a trip the weekend before, where he’d shown me their conversations and she had literally swapped their roles in several conversations they’d had - blatantly lying and trying to make it look like she’d rejected him and not the other way around. This conversation plus some other messed up stuff she’d done made me realize that Sarah was kind of a shitty person who enjoyed stirring up drama, and I started distancing myself from her. Sarah noticed and got extremely angry. 

I was later approached by a very distraught Leo, who told me that Sarah had blamed him for the whole situation, which confused me. Then Leo explained - Sarah and Brandon actually HAD slept together that night in the hotel and decided to keep it secret from everyone. Sarah, however, told Leo. When I started distancing myself from her, she assumed Leo had told me, and I was judging her. When Leo told me this, I wasn’t mad about Sarah, but rather, Brandon. I’d thought we were close, and had told him multiple times that I wouldn’t have cared/judged if he slept with Sarah (we had talked about her a lot). 

Once the internship ended, I really only kept in touch with Leo and Brandon. Brandon and I still talk on a regular basis, and I recently applied to a job at a company where he’s taken a position - so if I get it, we will both be moving away from friends and family to a whole new city and probably hanging out a lot again. I really treasure our friendship - he’s one of my best guy friends and we have a great 100% platonic relationship that’s super rare. However, I still can’t shake the feeling that I know he lied to me, and he even still brings up Sarah sometimes (saying stuff along the lines of “I should’ve went for it when I had the chance”). Should I say something? It really bothers me, and if we end up being coworkers and continuing to grow close as friends, I don’t want to bottle up my annoyance. On the other hand, it was long ago enough that it feels dumb to bring it up. Any insight? "
9o7io6,1,2018-10-14,Hillary Clinton Defends Bill’s Affair With Monica Lewinsky ‘Wasn’t an Abuse of Power’ (VIDEO),peterboykin,TheRightPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRightPill/comments/9o7io6/hillary_clinton_defends_bills_affair_with_monica/,"

### **Hillary Clinton defended her husband Bill Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in an interview on CBS’ “Sunday Morning.”**

Hillary also denied bullying the women who accused her husband of sexual harassment. “Bimbo eruptions” anyone?

“In retrospect, do you think Bill Clinton should have resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal?” CBS correspondent Tony Dokoupil asked Hillary.

“Absolutely not,” Hillary Clinton said without skipping a beat.

“It wasn’t an abuse of power?” Mr. Dokoupil asked.

“No. No.” Hillary said–spoken like a true feminist. Bravo Hillary!

Bill Clinton was nearly 50 years old in 1995 when he began an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

A few years later, the Drudge Report broke the news about the affair and it ultimately hit the mainstream media.

Bill Clinton initially denied having the affair with Lewinsky and Hillary called it a vast right-wing conspiracy.

Bill Clinton was ultimately impeached for perjuring himself.

Of course this was an abuse of power–Bill Clinton was the most powerful man on earth at the time he had an affair a White House intern who was only in her early twenties!

9o7jxx,3,2018-10-14,I need guidance/a friend?,abitoverwhelmedy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9o7jxx/i_need_guidancea_friend/," 

I’m just going to give a very quick summary in hopes that someone can relate or offer some friendly advice! 

I’ve dealt with anxiety for as long as I can remember due to continuous trauma from my childhood through my teen years. They were sad years but overall I was able to get through school with pretty good grades and into university. Now when I started university I came in as undeclared and quickly decided to follow materials science &amp; engineering and I was thrilled! However, during my first quarter of engr classes life struck again. At the time I wasn’t aware of it but I developed pretty severe PTSD from that event. I was taking chem, physics &amp; calc &amp; unfortunately didn’t do well &amp; wouldn’t be able to transfer to engr because I wouldn’t be able to reach the requirements by the deadline. I was devastated &amp; I could probably still cry about it today! I settled to major in business and “got by” until the end of my third year of college when I decided to go to the counseling center at my school. Its been about a year &amp; a half since &amp; I’m in a much better place now. 

Unfortunately I never got involved in school or got a job or an internship. A year ago I reached out to resources at my school (my academic advisor, the dean of my college, &amp; a case manager) but it didn’t go too well. My advisor &amp; the dean told me to get better soon &amp; the case manager was probably the most condescending person I’ve come across. It really discouraged me from reaching out to anyone else. 

I’m in my last year of school now I don’t know what to do or who to talk to. In terms of my PTSD I’ve picked up many tools to help deal &amp; I’m still healing! But now I just have a new set of challenges to deal with. I’m not happy with business &amp; I’d like to go into the tech field but I don’t know where to start (also pretty intimidated being a minority female). I don’t have anyone around me that I really trust &amp; can reach out to &amp; honestly I’m scared of relapsing again.

Also I haven’t told anyone about having PTSD. I’ve told my family that I went to therapy for my anxiety but they don’t know the severity of it. I feel that they wouldn’t understand &amp; I’m definitely not ready to open up about my trauma to anyone yet. 

In terms of school, I know I need to do something because I'm graduating soon. I’m scared because I don’t know how to explain to people that the past four years I had PTSD &amp; wasn’t able to do much. Am I supposed to hide that from people I reach out to? It makes me even more uncomfortable because a lot of people don’t understand mental illnesses to begin with. 

Any comments/advice/questions are welcome. This is definitely a very brief summary but I hope you guys get an idea. Thank you really to anyone who reads this!!! Also if I should post this somewhere else please let me know!"
9o7ovv,1,2018-10-14,[Futa4F]Employee of the Month for all the right reasons...,Why_must_you_know,futarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/futarp/comments/9o7ovv/futa4femployee_of_the_month_for_all_the_right/,"Working for a startup definitely has its benefits, especially a successful one. Me personally? I worked for a successful startup. Hours were great, the people were better, and their ""open mindset"" meant that they were very accepting of my girlcock, an absolute monster that'd dwarf any man's dick. I had the perfect skillset for the job, but I had been worried that having such a sizeable extra appendage wouldn't fit their feminist, ""all female employees"" agenda.

So what if I had a huge cock? I could just be as girly and feminine as every other woman who worked here. They just didn't get massive boners that threatened to rip right through their pants at all hours of the day. Most of the ladies here were understanding of my needs, to varying degrees of course. Quite a few were willing to give me a quick handjob in the bathroom, some would use their mouths, and the really nice ones would let me fuck them, though they seemed to enjoy that as much as I did.

That didn't really matter now, because now what I needed was release. I quietly got up from my desk, feeling an erection beginning to form. It was only 9:15, but my cock wasted no time in waking up. I nonchalantly made my way out into the hallway, the slight bulge of my slacks quickly becoming more and more noticeable. Hopefully some lady would be willing to help out in the bathroom, if I didn't run into a kinder soul on the way there.

-----

So! An all-female, hipster, modern tech company where one employee happens to have a huge cock, and the others are happy to help her out. We could do several short scenes with this one, all sorts of angles. Maybe her deskmate decides to hide out under her desk for a little bit? Or a friendly, understanding coworker is in the bathroom when she bursts in at full mast? Maybe it's an intern's first day on the job, or the CEO calls our lucky futa into her office to experience this cock she's heard so much about. As the title may have hinted, it'd be a fun tilt if her coworkers/superiors enjoyed her cock, and it helped her get professional success? e.g. a raise or a promotion? The more ideas you've got, the better!

I think it'd be fun if it was frowned upon for her to fuck in common areas, so we could incorporate that and the risk/taboo along with it.

I was intentionally vague on details so we could pick a ref for her. I have some I like to use, but if you have ones you like I'll definitely consider them! Basing her appearance off a celebrity is also an option. Same goes for any coworkers of her's you'd like to play.

Finally, my kinks(Some may not fit as well as others): Huge everything, bulges, distension, tons of cum, cum inflation, spanking, public sex/teasing, freeuse, name calling, cock worship, non-penetrative sex(titjobs, handjobs, etc.), pregnancy, lactating, tight clothes, teasing, casual sex/nudity, dirty/crude talk, and playing as youtubers/celebrities

Limits: Scat, piss, gore, bdsm, etc.

Please put a pun into your first message~ Can't wait to see those envelopes!"

It's only going to last 4 months so we decided to get on craigslist and look for a sublet. We found something pretty cheap in a decent part of town that is fully furnished and everything seems legit. He asked us to pay a deposit of $1,100 and first months rent which is $1,500. We had him send us his contract and ID just to make sure it was legit. He sent us the contract and ID and everything looked legit so we sent him the money via PayPal to his CPA and confirmed the receipt so he could send us the key. But then he emailed us and said that his landlord told him we need to pay for the full two months of rent since we are only going to be there for 4 months. We are a little nervous that that we might be getting scammed. I want to trust him, but we are tight on money and I just don't want to get swindled. So, my question I guess is if this is normal? Would a landlord require a two month rent plus a deposit for a sublet like this?  

&amp;#x200B;

We also asked him if he could send the key before we sent the money and also if we could get a receipt from his CPA from the money we already gave them. We're just a young couple who doesn't know any better and doesn't want to get swindled. Just want to know if I'm doing this right! Would love any advice help! Thank You!"

I have a BTech degree in CSE and I can code, build websites  and Mobile applications. I have experience in it, 7 websites and 10+ apps . My question is, can I get a job as a programmer in part time or freelancing. My friends in Australia said they earn $1000+ per month non tech jobs and expenses are around $500. I would be very happy even if I get as an intern in Machine Learning. Any suggestions are welcome. 

Edit : My family is low income, I will get education loan for the collage fee and also they have to take some credit for living expenses. I want to support them to clear off those credits by at least sending them $200-$300 back home. Hoping I will land a good job after the education after the education to clear my education loan. I know I have to work hard to do all these. 
Another thing is I know Yoga and I can teach it to other in morning hours. Want to know if I can do that and also I will be working part time job. Just need a confidence that I can do this. 
Also I have Canada as an option but I like Australia more. "

9o8spu,2,2018-10-14,Advice desperately needed: Discouraged Chemistry Student Thinking of Switching Majors to Biology,Hexactinellida,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/9o8spu/advice_desperately_needed_discouraged_chemistry/,"Hi everyone.  Thank you for opening this post.  I am in desperate need of some guidance regarding my academic career.  The title says it all really, but I want to fill in the details of my situation so my story will make sense.   I’ll post a tl;dr if it gets too long.  [Update: definitely posted that tl;dr]


I began my college career at a well respected community college back in the fall of 2012.  I was intending to be a Biology major and was taking first semester general chemistry as a pre requisite course for my cell and molecular biology class.  I had taken chemistry before in high school and it bored me.  I didn’t apply myself but still passed with a B.  Decided to give it a serious try in college and, Well, life had other plans for me.  I landed a phenomenal instructor who effectively engaged us with the material.  She would always point out the real world applications chemistry had in our daily lives and I was endlessly fascinated by the fact that chemistry is everywhere but who would have known because you can’t see it?!  My mind was blown by the fact that a handful of core concepts could explain so many things about the universe.  This was only my first semester, I aced the course and switched from biology to chemistry as a major.  I still continued to take biology courses along with my chemistry studies.

And I had 6 wonderful years in community college.  The reason I was there so long is because I was living with untreated bipolar disorder in high school and my first year of college, this affected how I recalled information I learned during the ill periods, so I had to fall back to intermediate algebra.  And I had to drop a bunch of classes my first two years.  However I finished my chemistry and biology education relatively early considering my timeline.  I was done with general, organic, and analytical chemistry at the end of the spring 2015 term and I took a bit of a break from biology but finished that by fall of 2015.  The next 3 years were focused on trudging through 5 semesters of math and 3 semesters of physics. 

From the very beginning, professors and peers alike noticed my academic aptitude and personable qualities.  This led to a wide range of opportunities in college for me.  My experienced allowed me to get totally immersed in the world of science, academia, and especially chemistry.  I really don’t mean to brag, but to show how dedicated I was to the scientific field.  I was nominated as chemistry student of the year my very first year, I was a chemistry grader and tutor for the first influential professor I had until she retired, I was a math tutor, I was a senior research assistant of 3 different projects in the depart,end of chemistry, I was president of the schools American Chemical Society chapter for 2 years, I served at the student representative of the schools chemical technology board and actively shaped the curriculum for that program, I earned over 16 scholarships and honors, and I had a paid internship at a pharmaceutical company.  Basically I was rocking community college inside and outside of the classroom.  I waked away from my school with 8 glowing letters of recommendation.  I showed a lot of potential as a student and I was living and breathing chemistry.

Last year I decided to be ambitious and apply to a very prestigious university among other schools, just to see if I would get in honestly.  I was all set up with guaranteed admission to another school.  I picked the chemistry BS degree as my major.  Little did I know what I was applying for.  I was incredibly humbled when I received the acceptance letter.  I couldn’t believe they chose me, but I still had no idea what that acceptance meant.  I started looking into the major and realized just how competitive it was.  My grades were good going in, but a bit below the average admitted student.  After receiving much encouragement from everyone, I accepted the admission offer.

I intended to review chemistry hardcore over the summer since it has been many years since I have even taken a chemistry course.  Well a combination of lack of discipline and having a symptomatic summer led me to get no studying done.  Developed panic disorder over the last year and the panic attacks were becoming more regular.

It’s my first semester now.  I loved everything about the university and especially the college of chemistry, it was a joyous experience going to school each day and reviewing chem while staying on top of the new material.  I thought things were going well.  But then my first round of exams happened.  For both courses, I scored below the class average.  To be fair, the average was in 50’s for one class but I got much lower.

I was just distraught and couldn’t believe it.  Unfortunately my scores triggered a small depression in me and I found it very hard to keep up with my studies and stay motivated.  What’s the point in trying if you’re just going to fail anyway?  I was registered with the schools disability office and they allowed me to drop a chemistry course I didn’t need for graduation and maintain a part time load because my condition worsened.  It’s also my first time living away from home so it’s been an adjustment.  Exam 2 came and went for a class on Friday and while I felt better about it last time, I just don’t think I did well enough for my standards.  The the thing that stung the most though was the mistakes I was making on the other chemistry exams.  There were fundamental holes in my knowledge.  I wasn’t even able to recall basic acid-base chemistry.  It has just been that many years since chemistry was on my radar and I know I should have studied harder over the summer.

But now it’s time to register for spring classes.  I just plopped in my two majors requirements for chemistry (2 classes) and looked at what else I can take so I don’t have too much free time on my hands.  I am taking a biology course to satisfy a graduation requirement this semester and I am fascinated with the material.  I looked to see what other courses they were offering in the term and that led to me looking to see what was offered in the fall and then looking up graduation requirements.  I did the planning and I could switch majors to biology and graduate on time no problem because I already took all of the lower division requirements at community college.

But I really feel like I would be admitting defeat if I gave up chemistry for bio since bio is the”easier” of the two.  I really do love chemistry and I have built my education and interests around it.  It would be sad to see all that go.  And my spot in the prestigious school could have been given to a more deserving student, someone who would have stuck with it.  I also wanted to stick with chemistry because it is a more valuable and employable degree than biology because biology majors are so common these days.

My thoughts are to enroll in another bio class, while taking my chem classes, just to keep my options open.  But do you guys have any advice for me now that I outlined the details?  I would just like to hear as many perspectives as possible.  Thank you!  I’m feeling pretty hopeless at the moment, but that may just be the depression speaking.  I really would like to graduate with a respectable GPA in chemistry but sadly I don’t know if this is realistic.  I also want to go to either med school or grad school.

Tl;dr was a rockstar chemistry student in community college.  Fell in love with the subject.  Took 6 years to transfer due to mental illness.  Last chemistry course was taken 3 years ago.  Didn’t review over the summer so bombed my first exams.  Thinking of switching majors to biology to circumvent my failure but don’t want to admit defeat.  I do like biology too though, started college as a bio major and finished the lower division requirements.  A reason I’m wanting to do chem is because it’s a more valuable and employable degree because biology majors are so common.  Also have dreams of med school or grad school so my grades are important.  So here I am seeking help from the Chemistry Gods of Reddit.  Any words of wisdom or advice would be greatly appreciated.

9o8v1q,7,2018-10-14,My current stack (Non-nootropic) for Depression/Anxiety | Need Help Looking for Nootropics to help with focus/productivity with learning programming,[deleted],StackAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/StackAdvice/comments/9o8v1q/my_current_stack_nonnootropic_for/,"I  struggle with depression and anxiety. Not sure if I have adhd but I  can't focus for nuts but that could be because of reddit and the  generation we seem to live in today. (The internet is definitely giving  us or worsening mental illness/adhd)

**Things that have helped me:**

1. **Wellbutrin**  \- NDRI. Eliminates a good amount of depression. Increased Physical  Energy &amp; Motivation. Assists with Wakefulness in the mornings and  good sleep hygiene. Makes you very social and talkative. Makes you  better at sports. Can cause anxiety at times but Fits very well with  meditation.
2. **LSD**  \- Destroys any period of uncontrollable anxiety and reverses negative  spirals in life. Whips you out of negative thought patterns and  behaviors and enables you to create the right ones. Rewires your brain  &amp; alters your mind for life. Changes your life, your perception of  it and the trajectory of it. Increases Creativity &amp; Curiosity by  100000X. Meditate on a low dose of lsd (You will become tantric) and  meditate for life after a trip.
3. **Meditation**  \- The **Head Space App** is really good. Basically makes you well balanced,  greater self-awareness, lower anxiety. Augments any other things you  do, supplements or meds you take and makes you better.
4. **Others** \- Healthy Diet, Reading Non-Fiction Bestsellers (You guys will love The Rise of Superman &amp; Stealing Fire by Steven Kotler as it talks about Flow, Optimal Neuropsychology, Neuroscience &amp; Brain Hacking), Listening to Tim Ferriss Podcasts.

**Things that have not worked:**

1. **Lexapro**  \- Fucking awful. Avoid SSRIs like the plague. I couldn't get out of bed  and felt fucking sleepy as hell in the mornings after a good 10 hour  sleep. This fucked up an internship I had and a really good internship  opportunity I had. Should have gotten off much sooner but didn't realize  better alternatives at the time.
2. **Ruminating** \- Was being a little bitch before. Find solutions or die trying.  Never ruminate on problems. We will solve the unsolvable.

**What I am searching for (Nootropics)** Preferably something on Amazon (1-click order mad convenient :) Thanks guys, love these subs!

* A **nootropic or stack to help me with zoning in/focusing and learning/memory.**  Not sure if I have ADHD/ADD but I don't want to take stimulants. I am  learning web development and need to really focus and learn quickly. I  have tendencies to get distracted easily or lose focus. 
* A **nootropic or stack to help lower anxiety**. Don't want to be dependent on LSD to destroy periods of high anxiety. Need to find something more sustainable and fit for corporate/full-time world."

Can you guys please help me learn from this.",Ballsortahard,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9o8x68/i_asked_someone_out_for_the_first_time_ever_and/,"I think this is going to be a bit of a long post, so sorry for that, I just want to provide as much context as possible so hopefully people can tell me what to do/what I can learn from this. I feel like I should mention that growing up, I had a hard time understanding social cues, but I thought I was much better at that sort of thing now.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout my undergrad/highschool I never had the confidence to ask women on dates, however I have had a girlfriend and have been with a few other women, I had just never made the first move (girls would either kiss me at a party or ask me to hang out). Last summer I worked with this woman who was absolutely beautiful (like the most attractive person I have ever seen in real life), I wasn't really interested in her initially because a close friend had past away (in hindsight I was probably depressed). Near the end of last summer I started talking to her and realized she was actually incredibly cool so I asked her on a date (for the first time ever), though I didn't explicitly use the word date and looking back at it now I think she might have thought I just wanted to spend time together platonically. What happened was were just speaking after work and she told me a really cool story about what she did that past weekend and I kinda thought (in my head) ""fuck, she's actually awesome I want to get to know her better"" so I said ""lets go get ice-cream and go for a walk Wednesday"", she said she couldn't Wednesday but asked if we could hangout Friday after work instead. I'm mentioning this all because I thought the fact that she wanted to spend time with me one on one, just hanging out and not doing anything specific, made me think that there was a solid chance that she was attracted to me last summer, furthermore she definitely did a couple things throughout our three months together that to me seemed flirty. We ended up not getting ice-cream on Friday, and I took her canceling on me as her not liking me; I only found out this past summer through a friend that she actually had a legit excuse (family emergency). About a week after her canceling that ""date"" (not really a date I guess, I just wanted to get to know her better before leaving) I flew across the country for my senior year of university. We spoke a little on Facebook, her apologizing for not being able to get ice-cream and telling me we should when I get back in town which again I took as a bit of a good sign (she reached out to me, not the other way).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 13 months to a week ago and I run into her on the way to class (I'm going to grad school and she's in her senior year at the same college). I'm hugely embarrassed about how I acted, but I here it is. We both are in a meeting together (brief meet up from our internship, not really important to this story) and then I leave to head to class, she calls out my name and I stop so we can walk together. We make casual small talk about what out plans are and then get into an elevator together (I totally recognize that this is the worst place to corner a woman and ask her on a date and what I did was pretty uncool). 

&amp;#x200B;

I kinda just phase out for about 1-2 seconds looking at her, I know its a clique to say that I got lost in her eyes, but thats honestly what happened. 

She looks at me and says ""what?"" 

It just kinda slipped out and I said ""We should go on a date"". I wasn't planning on saying that, but I did. 

Surprisingly she didn't say yes or no instead she just said ""Why?"". 

This was a total curveball for me and at the time I didn't know what to say so I said maybe the worst possible thing, which was ""Well I'm going to be back in \[city name\] for the next little while"". What I was trying to say was that I thought she was attractive in every possible way, and that now that we will both be living in the same city long term (instead of me just being there for my summer breaks) I would like to get to know her better.

Then she said ""Well I guess we could meet for coffee"", but the way she said it made it sound like she was somewhat uncomfortable/ didn't really want to to. 

I didn't want to put her in an awkward position so I just said ""No worries, just take it as a compliment""

Then a couple more people got in the elevator and I just kinda stared of into space, looked at the time and said something irrelevant like ""well, sorry you're going to be late for class"" and she responded awkwardly with something like ""its fine"".

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I got out of the elevator I was full of regret, she had told me that she had never been in a relationship the previous summer, and being as pretty as she was I would imagine she would have to turn down guys every week. I started to think (and spoke to a friend about this) that she was probably just feeling awkward about me asking her on a date and that she wanted to get to know me a little better than going on what I imagine would have been her first ""date"", especially considering that I hadn't spoke to her for more than two hours over the past year. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bright side was I new that I would run into her the next day, so I thought really hard about what I was going to say. I was going to say something along the lines of ""I'm sorry for surprising you like that, you know as well as anyone that I don't have much of a filter sometimes, if you're still interested coffee would be nice.""

&amp;#x200B;

But when I tried to talk to her, maybe the worst possible thing happened. Her and I plus three others were talking at a work thing (little thing for all the past interns again, not really important).

&amp;#x200B;

I lightly touched her on the arm and said ""can we talk for a second?"" and she said ""No."". 

Again this was totally surprising and I didn't know what to think, I still can't understand why she wouldn't give me a minute (in a public place) to just let me briefly clear the air.

So then I said ""I just wanted to say sorry"" and she said ""its ok"" and I said ""I'll see you around"" and left.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be at a mandatory event for my program where I will be seeing her this upcoming Friday and I really don't know what to do. Right now my plan is to just be polite with her and give her as much space as possible (i.e. wave at her if she walks by, but don't approach or try to talk to her). Is that the best way to handle this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the essay.

I need to say that I'm in college,studying economics and although I love the course, I have no idea what area I should work in, any job I could get would be good .This gets worse when many of my classmates are already working and I end up comparing myself to them.


It also worsens because of the family pressure I feel, my mother really wants me to get a job and as I said I want it too, the problem is that I feel that I leave her disappointed, even though I know that I have the conditions to get it, that leaves me even more depressed 


Recently, I was at a family lunch with my father and my grandfather, I do not remember what we were talking about but the subject turned to me getting  a job and my dad said things like he's not putting any effort , he's not even trying to get a job my grandfather tried to calm things down by saying that nowadays it is difficult and that in his time it was easier to get a job, but that ended up making me sad because It seemed like I'm not good enough.


I also need to say my grandmother passed away 3 years ago and although it seems like this has nothing to do with my current situation, I believe this has moved me a lot. My grandmother always took care of me when I was younger, my parents were not present most of the time, so it was she who would take me to medical appointments and that sort of thing, if I wanted to do something, it was she who encouraged me. I did not realize at that moment and I deeply regretted later that I could not thank her for everything she did for me, the fact is that when I face big problems today, I end up reminding myself of her and how she would help me and how she would guide me through difficult situations and how she isn’t present, this also depresses me a lot.


I went to the psychologist for 6 months and talked about a lot of what I'm talking about here, it helped me understand the moment that I'm going through, but it did not help me to understand what I should do to give the next passes in my search for an internship , I have no perspective , I do not see where I'll be in X years, I do not know what I'm doing wrong and I do not know what to do to get a job in fact, I just know that I need an internship or a job and the anguish of not succeeding has made me more and more sad and depressed. In every moment that I spend money that is not mine, I feel bad, I can not even go see a movie without thinking about it. I feel I should be doing something to change this, but I'm not, I feel I would be happier if i was, I feel I owe myself, I feel that I am disappointed myself and that I should be the only person who would not disappoint me.

I have participated in some selective processes and some group dynamics but no interview so far and I am getting more and more tired of doing language tests and other types of tests because this has got me nowhere and has not given me any feedback.


I did not want to make a big text, sorry ...


IF SOMEONE CAN HELP ME, GIVE ME A LIGHT, A PERSONAL OR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE I WILL BE VERY THANKFUL ✌️

***July 18, 1965***

[Birth of Jim Bob](http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=7356) . JimBob was born to [Mary “Grandma” Duggar](http://fundamentalists.wikia.com/wiki/Mary_Duggar)  and [Jimmy Lee “JL” Duggar](http://fundamentalists.wikia.com/wiki/JL_Duggar)  and raised in a [cabin](https://people.com/home/the-duggars-move-grandma-duggars-cabin/) with older sister [Deanna](http://fundamentalists.wikia.com/wiki/Deanna_Duggar) . As [fundamentalists.wikia](http://fundamentalists.wikia.com/wiki/Jim_Bob_Duggar)  notes of JimBob’s childhood “The Duggars did not have a lot of money, and in one of the books Jim Bob wrote as an adult he mentioned a time where his mother had to cook decorative rice because it was the only food in the house. Jim Bob often blames this on his father being unable to handle money. In the book Growing Up Duggar, which Jim Bob's daughters wrote, they mention that JL was not a good ""spiritual leader of the home"", a statement they don't expand on. Not much else is known about Jim Bob's childhood”.

Jim Bob attended Shiloh Christian School and was part of their first graduating class. In 1979, First Baptist Church of Springdale--which included Shiloh Christian School, founded in 1976--moved from downtown Springdale to a site on Johnson Road. It was at the [Johnson Road location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1707+Johnson+Rd,+Springdale,+AR+72762/@36.1689574,-94.1569156,3a,75y,134.12h,98.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sc9OG7zmYujGuHaqWa9j-Pw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x87c96ca1edd5cbbf:0x770c0952755e83ee!8m2!3d36.1705196!4d-94.1557112) Jim Bob would marry Michelle, then live at somepoint for at least 7-14 years in the free church house before moving to Tin Mansion, then renew their vows in 2009 before the church changed its name to [Cross Church](http://www.duggarfamilyblog.com/2015/01/the-duggars-and-cross-church.html) in 2010 and Jill married there in 2014.

***September 13, 1966***

[Birth of Michelle](http://fundamentalists.wikia.com/wiki/Michelle_Duggar)

***Around 1979-1983ish***

The [Great Bikini Lawn Mowing Incident](https://www.inquisitr.com/1563350/michelle-duggar-was-once-a-bikini-wearing-wild-child/) occurred during this time. Michelle dates other dudes before JB, is a cheerleader who wears thigh high skirts, and is popular. Neighbors call her parents over her barely there outfits.

***Around 1981/1982***

At 15, Michelle is saved and commits her life to the Lord. Meets JB at a friend’s church, doesn’t remember him. [Then a guy, Fred, from her school that goes to JB church is all like, ""I know this girl from school that just got saved and is a cheerleader.""  And Jim Bob is like, ""I'd better go visit her.""](https://home-school.lovetoknow.com/Duggar_Family_Interview) After visiting with her and inviting her to Sunday School, Jim states as he was leaving Michelle’s home he prayed “""Lord, I would love to be her spiritual leader. Can she be mine?"" FYI: Michelle spent the time talking with Fred and doesn’t remember Jim Bob. While Jim Bob ~~preys on~~ prays for her.

***Around 1982/1983***

Michelle applied for a position at a Frozen yogurt shop, starting her lifelong love of ice cream and beginning her Duggar journey—Grandma Duggar was the manager of the Yogurt shop and, apparently, the owner as well (unsure of this but manager and owner of this establishment are thrown around in regard to Grandma D.). She mentions Michelle’s application to Jim Bob and he tells his mom she HAS to hire Michelle. Michelle meets Jim Bob one day when he is fixing the cash register and [he asks Michelle to his Junior/Senior Banquet where neither can eat anything and afterwards they spent 4 hours reading the bible at Michelle’s home](http://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/19-kids-and-counting/michelle-duggars-blog/michelle-tells-all-about-her-first-date-jim-bob/).

***1983-1984***

Michelle quit cheerleading. FYI: The football players and cheerleaders partied together. Jim Bob also didn’t have to wait until marriage to get more than a side hug from Michelle. [According to Radar](https://radaronline.com/photos/michelle-duggar-19-kids-counting-tlc-photos-jim-bob), the “abstinence only” fans “got physical” before they walked down the aisle.

***May 1984***

Michelle (Springdale Public High School) and Jim Bob (Shiloh Christian High School) graduate from their High Schools.

***July 21, 1984***

Michelle (17, almost 18) and Jim Bob (19) exchange marriage vows-- look at their invite...  There is apparently an audio recording of the wedding which the couple [plays for their children every year](http://www.duggarfamilyblog.com/2014/07/michelle-duggar-recalls-her-wedding.html) but I was unable to track down for our listening pleasure. Also, the [thriftiness began as they did](https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/07/michelle-duggar-30-wedding-anniversary-details-jim-bob/): Michelle baked the wedding cake, wore Grandma Duggar’s wedding dress, and honeymooned at an Arkansas State Park, which did not go as planned.  Apparently, Jimbob and M [started off selling used cars JB would do repairs on](https://www.christianpost.com/news/how-the-duggars-live-debt-free-with-19-kids-73444/), which makes the robbery story fit in…  this leads to a towing business which is sold down the road to get into real estate as well as several used car lots.

***1984-1988ish***

Known lovingly as BJ: Before Josh. At that time, they chose to use [THE pill](http://www.duggarfamily.com/about).

***March 3, 1988***

Joshua ""Josh"" James 1 :  The Golden Child. Realizing they made a mistake the Duggar’s go back on the oral birth control. (conceptionish: June 1987)

***January 23, 1989***

Michelle [suffers the miscarriage of Caleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Bob_Duggar).  Michelle and Jim Bob believed the miscarriage was a message from God, because she was on THE birth control pill. They decided to stop using any contraceptives and mass produce. The Birth Control Pill becomes a huge part of their testimony.  While some note Caleb was not celebrated like Jubilee, he does have a [graveside](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81726199/caleb-duggar) in the same cemetery as Jubilee.

***1989-1990***

JimBob [is Robbed at his own home while Michelle is there, asleep and pregnant with Twins1.0](https://imgur.com/gallery/lPLFL). Also, make some applemonade and suck the venom out.

Blessings from God: Jana Marie 2 &amp; John-David 3 (conceptionish: April 1989. Born 22 months after Josh. [Delivered via C section due to having pre-eclampsia](https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/03/michelle-duggar-jim-bob-births-c-sections-regular-baby-breakdown-19-kids-video/)

***May 17, 1991***

Jill Michelle  4  (conceptionish: Aug 1990, 8 months after the birth of the twins. Born 16ish months after the twins.)

***1992***

Possibly around the time the Duggar’s move into the [Free Church House](https://www.facebook.com/TLC/posts/the-duggar-original-house-for-14-was-provided-by-the-church-next-door-for-free-t/10156167746025173/) with three bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. This will be the home featured in early specials. They live here for the next 14ish years until Tin Mansion is built. Also, JB is a lying liar who lies.

This may also be the time frame that JB saw the [ILBP’s  Financial Freedom Seminar](https://iblp.org/discipleship-tools/financial-freedom/overview).  From this look in, it seems JB and M purchased their first home prior to marriage and JB was interested in investment properties. HOWEVER, [this](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-duggars-live-debt-free-2012-4#jim-bob-credits-his-financial-success-to-two-sources-god-and-a-16-hour-financial-freedom-seminar-by-jim-sammons-1)  made me think that JB got the seminar NOT back in the mid/late 80s but more in the 90s. Plus, the whole 7 years to pay for the house in cash (2000 was when the land and kit was purchased.) puts it at about 1992-1993ish.

Regardless, with Michelle’s miscarriage, turn to fundie esp with being blessed with not only twins but row of healthy births after the “conversion” this time frame would work with an intro into the seminars and the “debt free lifestyle” taking over as they get deeper into this cult.

Michelle starts a [Christian-based homeschool curriculum once Josh is 4 years old](https://www.romper.com/p/michelle-duggars-homeschool-curriculum-raises-a-few-questions-8434001).

And see how this would work in with cult belief sex belief and practice to continue the delusion that God is blessing these stupid fuckers. This could be another part of the puzzle.)

***1994***

Jimbob sells the [car business and goes into real estate](https://www.christianpost.com/news/how-the-duggars-live-debt-free-with-19-kids-73444/). They buy and converted a former chicken hatchery into 10 commercial rental units.

***1999***

JimBob begins his service in the [Arkansas House of Representatives and serves until 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Bob_Duggar).   This is JB’s “job” outside of his real estate stuff. While [this article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/here-are-jim-bob-duggars-political-stances-on-sexual-assault) deals with the 2002 campaign it has 1999ish photos

***2000***

Construction of their [7,000 square-foot house](http://www.kodiaksteelhomes.com/images/DuggarFloorPlan.pdf) began when they bought the lot and ordered two steel frames. One wasn’t drilled correctly, which means they ended up with 3 kits and could build the girls’ room and the ugly kitchen that never gets used. The house isn’t finished or moved into for another 6 years.

I also think the Laundry Room Meltdown occurred at somepoint during this timeframe. 1. God answered her with NaNa, their piano teacher. Josh, Jana, JD, Jill, Jessa, and maybe even Jinger would be about right age wise for piano. But she’s also have 5 under 5. I think “jurisdictions” started around this point in time if not prior.

***May 19, 2015***

In Touch Weekly reported that Duggar had told the Arkansas State Police that his oldest son, [Josh Duggar, had molested five underage girls, including family members, when he was 14–15 years old](https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/bombshell-duggar-police-report-jim-bob-duggar-didn-t-report-son-josh-s-alleged-sex-offenses-for-more-than-a-year-58906).  This lead to the cancelation on Kids and Counting as well as a host of other things like Jill and Derrick’s Mission after Derrick quit Walmart (oddly a little bit before the news hit the tabloid shit fan… I have a theory… First, I looked up the Scandal release date of May 19 2015. I noted the last time TLC started the show in Feb, they had 26 episodes and went until October. The last season was 22 episodes aired from Feb to May. Then I noticed how the last 4 episodes aired. The last four episodes were released May 12 and May 19 as two one hour episodes aired back to back. This lead me to the idea that perhaps TLC knew about Josh all along and/or knew the story was going to break. Media orgs have working relationships and understand advertisers. I think TLC had the story held until after May 19th. Also, Derick started looking at missionaries prior and I want to say had quit Walmart by the time the news hit.)

After the initial reporting on the redacted police report, an unidentified victim, reportedly still a minor, requested that any remaining products of the investigation be destroyed. Judge Stacey Zimmerman granted this request to protect the unidentified victim's privacy.

I'm scared of telling my girlfriend when I'd rather just have a weekend to myself because I'm scared that she'll get hurt or mad and I'll feel guilty. I'm scared of scheduling doctor's appointments. I'm scared of going to talk to someone about my fears because I feel like I can't get them across. Even last week, when my grandpa was helping me buy a car, I got scared and uncomfortable when he negotiated with the dealer.

I'm just sick of this shit. In my mind I know that there is absolutely no reason to fear any of these situations because they don't put my in danger. But my body reacts like I'm about to die and it sucks. I shake, I feel horribly sick to my stomach, I get dizzy, and my mind gets foggy so I can't think clearly.

Where do I start with this? I know I'm capable of getting past it but I'm having such a hard time figuring out how! I just want to relax and be at peace with my words, actions, and decisions but other people seem to get the best of me.

Mind you this might be long, but thanks for reading. 

My parents fled their home country to come to the states, they made a life for themselves here and wanted to have children. My parents turned to infertility treatment and after 2 failed attempts my mom was pregnant with triplets. 

We were born with no complications, two boys and one girl(me). 

I didn’t realize it then, but my childhood wasn’t great. 

The environment I grew up in wasn’t very suitable. My mother was/is a somewhat of a hoarder. The house we lived in was very dirty almost all the time, and some rooms were so filled with bags and clutter that you couldn’t see the floor and there were only small footpaths across rooms. When I was little I remember looking for a toy and lifting up a bag only to accidentally throw rat poop and dust all over myself. My parents also always seemed to be “renovating” the house and I went about 3 or 4 years in elementary school without a room or a bed. I slept on the floor with my siblings in my parents room. I distinctly remember my neighbor’s dog, because this dog slept on a old mattress in our neighbor’s yard and I thought to myself the dog has it better off than me. My parents were also district hoppers so my commute to school was on average 1.5 to 2 hours each way. Because district hopping is a crime, my parents didn’t allow me to stay after school, make friends, or go to any social events when I was little “like play dates and birthday parties”. In addition my parents never let me go outside the house except to go to school. I was trapped in this environment with no way to escape except to while I was in school.

My father worked the majority of the time so I would only see him when he’d come home from work which would be in the evening and he would get drunk often when he got home. He was an angry drunk so he would trash and destroy things and my brothers and I had to clean it up. My mother didn’t work, she stayed at home and took care of us. However from a very young age I had be responsible for a lot.  

My parents behavior was what I struggled the most with. From a very young age my parents were super strict about manners and upbringing. It was ingrained into me that family is the most important thing, above all else. How my parents felt about me was all that mattered and my value as a human being depended on it. Misbehaving came with dire consequences. My father would beat us if we misbehaved. He would use these wooden dowels that were long and maybe thicker than a pencil and break them on us. When he didn’t have those handy, he would use his palms or belts. There were numerous instances when I had to miss school because beatings were visible on me (bruises/welts etc). Normally if I knew I was due for a beating, I would try to hide until my dad was too drunk/ went to sleep. Many times I crawled into the space between the floor of the house and the ground (foundation/crawl space) and hid there until morning. There was one instance where my father was so mad at me that he pinned me down and my flight/fight instincts kicked in and I wiggled an arm free and threw the closest thing I can grab at him. Fighting back was a big mistake and I was beaten so hard that time that I’m pretty sure I didn’t go to school for a week and slept in the crawlspace for multiple nights. 

My mother was a different story, although not physically abusive usually, she was very emotionally and mentally abusive. She is very narcissistic and gas-lighted me. She was the one calling the shots in terms of what was “misbehaving” and told my father to beat me. Even the littlest things the stepped outside of straight worshiping my parents. I was careful to always have a calm smile or neutral expression in my mother’s presence. I watched my breathing because even sighing was followed my punishment. She made me feel incredibly guilty for just existing. She would tell me that when she was pregnant that the doctors recommended that they abort one or two of us and that she refused to do so. She talked about it like she was so merciful and that I owed her for doing so. She constantly claimed that her life would be so much better and easier if she didn’t have me. When I didn’t do perfectly in school she would tell me that she gave up her life in her home country and came here with my father so that I could have a better life, and how disappointed she was that I was just spitting in her face and being so ungrateful. She would also put my siblings and I against each other, by dismissing and shaming the one who misbehaved and when the “bad” child was watching would show affection to the “good” child (this would change depending who she was punishing). From as far back as I can remember I truly felt that I was a burden and that if I was just good enough maybe my parents would love me and I would be worth something. My entire life revolved around being the best child and all my actions were motivated by earning my parents love. 

I was so stuck in this situation, there was no way out. One time I accidentally let some information slip to a teacher at school that my parents were abusive. Nothing substantial from what I remember but enough for the school to inquire with my parents via letter. My parents were so furious with me that I had to sleep outside that night in the dog house. My parents had a friend who wrote a legal letter claiming that I was trying to get attention and that I had some special ed needs. To appease the school my parents had to take me to a number of counseling sessions outside of school. My mom came to every single one of them and didn’t let me talk at all. Eventually the counselor stopped trying to communicate with me and it became a chatting time about how hard it is to raise kids. At the end of it all, everything went back to normal and I was given a succulent to take care of. After that whole ordeal my parents made it very clear that if I got myself taken away from them my life would be HORRIBLE, so I stayed quiet. 

Once I got to high school I doubled down extra hard on good child behavior. I did excellent in school, rarely made a fuss, and tried my best to prepare for college. Regardless things were still very unstable at home. When I was 17, there was one night my father got so drunk, that he locked himself in his car with a revolver. He was so drunk and upset he was trying to shoot himself. I was on the outside trying to open the door and banging on the window begging him not to do it. He put the gun up to his head and pulled the trigger… but the gun didn’t fire. He had forgotten to load the gun so he just threw it angrily at the windshield and passed out. I waited by the car all night until he went to work the next morning. Whenever violent things happened in the family we never talked about it, my mom would just blame it on one of us or my father. 

In my senior year I was named a valedictorian candidate and I had been accepted to a few really great universities. However my success didn’t change my parents and I still wasn’t good enough to be loved by my them. At this point in my life I started turning to self harm and suicidal ideations soon followed as I was constantly told I was a burden on my family. After struggling with this for some time I tried explaining to my mom that I felt like I wanted to die. She said that I should kill myself then, everything would be much easier if I was gone. So I tried. I overdosed and got extremely sick but survived. My parents never took me to the hospital but instead let me stay home from school until I recovered. 

After I finished high school I was college bound. I got accepted to many universities across the country, but my parents forced me to attend the closest university to home. This is when I started supporting myself financially. I moved into the dorms, and worked 20+ hours a week while in school and the cost of tuition was paid for completely by scholarships I received or loans I took out under my name only which really bothered me because my parents had a college fund but never used it on us. Regardless of this, my parents siphoned half of every paycheck under the guise that I owed them for raising me. Every interaction was demeaning and abusive, and my mental stability worsened over time. I eventually made additional attempts on my life and I was encouraged to seek some help. I started seeing a therapist through my university. For the first time ever I was told that what I experienced was not okay. 

After my second year at the university I decided the best thing for me to do is to transfer somewhere else and pursue my academic dreams. I applied and was accepted to another university across the country. When my parents discovered I was leaving, they were furious. They cut me off the family insurance plan, threw away all my belongings, and removed any safety net I had. I was told I was never welcome back. So with two suitcases I moved and continued supporting myself fully while attending school. I had secretly saved up money by working extra hours, but it wasn't enough to afford tuition. I ended up taking out a private loan on my own without a cosigner to continue to fund my education. Moving away from my parents removed a huge stressor from my life, but introduced many others as well. I no longer had a safety net, what I had with me was everything I own. If I ran out of money then there would be no one to help me. During school I had a place to live, but during the summer I did not. If I didn’t land an internship, it meant I was homeless for a few months before school starts again. I had no permanent address, no safe place to come back to if things got difficult. While I saw on social media that my mom was spending the “college fund” traveling around the world. Not to mention that I was still tied to my parents in the eyes of the Fafsa, and I needed to convince them every year to provide me with their tax information to continue going to school. This loomed over me everyday. Regardless of this, I did my best to keep things together. I worked anywhere from 1 to 3 jobs at a time while remaining a full time student and taking a full course load.

Over a year ago I was struggling a lot. My ex broke up with me because I wasn’t giving him enough sex. My summer housing plans had fallen though and I couldn’t afford the medications to manage my depression anymore. I had been stockpiling opioid and antidepressant pills and made another attempt on my life by overdosing. I was nearly successful this time, however I was found in a parking lot unconscious by someone. The next thing I remember was waking up suddenly in an ambulance after being pumped full of naloxone and then passing out again. I was in and out of consciousness in the ER, but once I was stable I was transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility. I was there for two weeks, and my roommate ended up contacting my brothers about my absence and my brothers ended up tracking down the hospital I was staying in. I refused to talk to my parents then, and following my release I had a lot of trouble adjusting back into school. Over that following summer I started developing psychotic symptoms and ended up in the hospital again. I was diagnosed with depression with psychotic features, with a speculation of schizophrenia unspecified. This time my mother ended up talking to me on the phone and basically blew off everything I was struggling with mentally, telling me to just “look in the mirror and be better”. Thankfully at university I grew a really great support network and I have been managing my mental illness better and better over time. 

Finally this year after not having talked to my parents in quite some time, I landed a very good internship at a tech company in my hometown. While I was working there my brothers encouraged me to come home for 4th of July. I was very reluctant but I ended up going. It was oddly normal, my parents acted nice and normal like nothing ever happened. This I found extremely off putting and I kept wondering what the catch was. By the end of the night though, I got a ride back to my apartment from my brother and I entertained the thought that I could maybe have a normal relationship with my parents. My internship goes smoothly and it is the day of my flight back to school. My parents show up unannounced to my apartment. My father is completely silent while my mom with a smile says that they came to wish me a safe flight and that also she never wants to see me ever again. She hands me my birth certificates, passports, and other documents in a bag and tells me that I am to never contact them again ever. Stunned I say alright and they leave. 

That evening my brother is driving me to the airport and we have to make a stop at my parents house because my other brother says shit is going down. When we arrive my father is drunk and crying telling me that I hate my family and him. I am just so emotionally beaten down at this point I ask my brother to just drive me to the airport, and after a disturbing text from my brother, I call a safety check on my parents house as I’m waiting in line to board my plane. 

My brother confirmed that things didn’t escalate any further at home, and it’s been a two months since then. I haven’t heard from them at all. I support myself fully, I have my own insurance, I work as a teaching assistant, I live with my boyfriend in our own apartment and I got approved to change my status to independent after documenting the relationship with my parents. Things are going really well for me. I am about to graduate and I got a few offers from high paying tech companies. However all I can think about is that no one will be at my graduation and I have no one who is proud of me for my accomplishments. I’m embarrassed of what my boyfriend’s parents might think if I have no family at the ceremony. 

Sometimes I wish that my parents had given me up for adoption when I was little because at least that way I’d have an acceptable reason for not having a family. And of course I have my friends and my boyfriend here at the university who are proud and there for me. But I just feel so, broken that I’m the only one who doesn’t have parents that love them. It was so ingrained in me that what my parents thought of me was the most important thing. I accept that they may never love me, and they may never even be sorry for what they did to me. However I can’t shake the desire to get them to care, and it breaks my heart that they may never see justice. 

I’m going to therapy regularly, hopefully I can move on some day, but graduation may be a sad day for me. "
9oakyr,3,2018-10-15,Updating bound property on device input event,TheFlyingWalrus,dotnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/9oakyr/updating_bound_property_on_device_input_event/,"Hello! I have been slowly learning ASP.Net Core on my own at my internship, and have recently gotten stuck with this issue:

I have a razor page with a single bound string property. When the pages constructor is called, i connect a Zebra Scanner device to it with the CoreScanner SDK provided by Zebra for their products. I then bind one of the pages member-functions as a callback to be called for when the scanner scans a barcode. When i run the page in debug-mode and set a breakpoint in the callback-function (OnBarcodeScanned) it successfully breaks within the function, and i can set the bound string property to whatever string the callback returns. However, after the callback is called the displayed string on the page is not changed. I have not been able to figure out the solution to this problem, and i'm not sure where to start. One thought i've had is that since no ""POST"" action is called upon callback, the page does not ""know"" to update itself. I've figured that maybe i need to somehow move the scanner-callback logic to ""client-side"", and have that push a ""POST"" to the page so it can be updated. I've also looked a bit at using AJAX for this. The problem here is that since i'm self-taught and noone where i intern can code i could really use a second opinion to clear up any misconceptions i might have.

Here is some sample code:
**InternalReview.cshtml:**

    @page
    @model QModulePrototype.Pages.InternalReviewModel
    
    @{
        ViewData[""Title""] = ""InternalReview"";

    &lt;body&gt;
        @Html.DisplayText(Model.ScannedXML)
        @Model.ScannedXML;
    &lt;/body&gt;

**InternalReview.cshtml.cs:**

    public class InternalReviewModel : PageModel
        {
            private readonly ScanningContext _scanningContext;
    
            [BindProperty]
            public string ScannedXML { get; set; }
    
            public InternalReviewModel(ScanningContext scanningContext)
            {
                ScannedXML = ""XML GOES HERE\n"";
                _scanningContext = scanningContext;
                _scanningContext.Open(); // Initialize connection
                _scanningContext.GetScanners(); // Find scanners
                _scanningContext.SubscribeBarcodeEvent(OnBarcodeEvent);
            }
    
            public IActionResult OnGet()
            {
                return Page();
            }

9oazig,43,2018-10-15,I'm pretty sure I met an Angel,OriginalReach,ParanormalEncounters,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/9oazig/im_pretty_sure_i_met_an_angel/,"I rarely tell this story for obvious reasons , but about 10 years ago I had an interview for a very very very elite internship in  NY. 

My gf at the time suggested that I stay at her best friend's place , who's rich parents had him set up in a swanky midtown apartment while he attended NYU. She would come with me and we would make a weekend of it. It seemed logical enough, I did need a place to stay and it seemed more manageable in my young naiveté to do that than get a hotel room. But also in my youth, i didn't really take into account how combative my ex got when around this friend. For reasons only known to her,  while usually very mild mannered being around him caused her to often pick fights and become aggressive so that he would 'back her up'. What was supposed to be me preparing for the interview, turned into mostly trying to dodge arguments with her and refusing to go out with them. No one understood that I wasn't there to party. once, my ex even came in the room i was going over flashcards with and snatched them out of my hands. 

by the time the interview came, I was so dejected and really just ready to go home. I knew as i was sitting there that i wouldn't get it. which was the worst feeling.

on the 8 hour bus ride home by myself i was in this weird state of shock and depression. I couldn't believe that someone I cared about cared so little about my goals and that i had allowed outside sources to throw me off my game. 

on the layover there was a man  wearing a soft , brown leather hat that said ""panama"". as a fan of brown leather, and hats, i complimented him. he smiled and said ' thank you , i got it on a recent retreat'. when it was time to get on the bus, i was way ahead of him. but , somehow, when he got on the bus as the last person, there was only one seat open, and that seat was beside mine.  He said, ""I was hoping I would sit beside you"". 

over the next 5 hours we had the most delightful conversation which really helped to distract my troubled mind. I told him that I had just read 'the celestine prophecy' . he said ' oh that's one of my favorite books and usually a starting point to a lot of people's enlightenment' . He said that he was a master carpenter who did fine and intricate wood work for people's home renovations and that he had made a pretty good living for himself. He was coming from a consultant job and his flight was canceled so he decided to take a bus down to ""see this part of the country"" during fall. 

when he asked where i was coming from, i was almost too defeated to say it out loud. but, since i figured i would never see him again and i hadn't been able to talk to anyone about it - I might as well. I told him about the weekend, the horrible interview, and how I felt like a failure and blew the opportunity ""of a lifetime"" and how sad I was.

he said, "" well you know, there's this scripture that goes ' look at the flowers. look at the birds in the sky,they don't sow, or reap, or store food in  into barns; but God takes care of them. why don't you think he'd do the same for you?'  Now, I'm not a religious person to know scriptures and usually find people quoting them via memory to be corny - but a sense of peace and comfort really washed over me that I needed. 

I asked him if he was a christian , bc it was a bit surprising -for me at the time- to have someone quoting scripture and talking about new age books. He said, rather evasively ""I wouldn't really consider myself a Christian. I don't call it that, but I'm in line with those teachings. I just kind of always have been""

I thought this was such an odd answer for someone to give a yes or no question. Especially one that's as straight forward as ""are you a Christian"". But the dude seemed really interesting, so i thought whatever.

When it was my stop, I thanked him for the conversation and for the encouraging words. At my request, he wrote down his email to stay in touch. a week or so later after I had got the rejection email from the internship, i was up late at night worried about how I would get a job as a new college grad with no prospects (and in 08 when the economy was nothing). I was flipping through channels and caught a snippet of an infomercial christian tele thing. And the pastor was saying the exact same scripture that the man on the bus told me (apparently its Matthew 6:26) . I had never head that scripture before in my life , so the coincidence gave me chills. 

I immediately sent him an email. But, mailer demon came back. The email address, that he wrote down in print clearly, didn't exist. 

I am certain that God sent this being to me to lift my spirits that were completely in the pits during a time i was feeling really alone. "
9oazok,1,2018-10-15,A policy failure can be seen from scratch.,betnakul,u_betnakul,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_betnakul/comments/9oazok/a_policy_failure_can_be_seen_from_scratch/,"In order to fundamentally solve the problem, we must find the root of the problem. If someone is to blame in finding the root of the problem, no one will try to tell the truth. Eventually, the reality will be covered up with a stopgap measure, and the nature of the problem could be blurred.In order to get to the root of the problem[스포츠토토사이트](https://www.betsarang.com), one must return to the origin and look at the problem again. This is called shift lift. We write from left to right when we write. Therefore, to modify the sentence shall be moved to the left. Only when you go back to the starting point and look at the problem again can you see why you failed.The number of employed people remained below 100,000 for eight months from February to September this year. It is the so-called ""employment barrier."" Although the government made policy efforts by organizing supplementary budget twice, the situation worsened. This is because he did not return to square one. The king crossed the golden line. The Ministry of Strategy and Finance said it would order public agencies to expand jobs in the short term and reflect the growth in management evaluations. It is inferred that he followed the president's intention.The expansion of short-term jobs less than a year is nothing other than a temporary measure to improve employment trends. This is no different from the government's initiative in promoting employment statistics. Public institutions have already announced plans to hire interns every year according to the government's policy, and are hiring them every quarter. Only a few of them are hired full-time. Under these circumstances, if the number of short-term interns without regular employment opportunities is increased, the government cannot be free from criticism that it has used them as expendables, let alone budget problems.The government has been making defensive explanations for the slowdown in the number of employed people due to the decrease in the production population (15 to 64). A decrease in the production population would ease pressure on job competition, making it easier to find jobs. However, the employment rate in September was 66.8 percent, a four-month decline since June. A fall in employment means that fewer people are employed than fewer people.Meanwhile, if the production population has decreased, competition pressure will be eased, reducing the number of job seekers. The number of job seekers who have worked for jobs within the past year reached a record high of 556,000 last month. This means that they cannot explain the employment barrier due to the decrease in the production population. In addition, the quality of employment has deteriorated. This is because there have been fewer manufacturing jobs created in the market and a significant increase in unsustainable jobs backed by government budgets.Then, what should we return to square one? In May last year, Moon Jae-in The administration's first destination is Incheon Airport Corporation. We will make non-regular workers in the public sector zero."" In other words, irregular workers are often called ""regular workers"" and are not a product of the system. Moon Jae-in, the government declared the nation's biggest employers. The government's infinite responsibility for employment is the agenda of the socialist state. Moon Jae-in and government income growth led by the railway station is ‘It can drive growth through the distribution’, the key to the idea. Policy reverse thinking, not corporate strategy, is dangerous. It was believed that raising the minimum wage would activate the income-led growth mechanism. Employment disasters cannot be avoided unless these three are returned to square one.Changing the situation can turn the tide. It is not income-driven but investment dogma that brings good growth. And the government's maximum contribution to employment is the supply of public services, or non-market goods. Jobs are created by companies in the market. Work creates jobs. In the end, it needs to empower businesses. The government should minimize intervention in the market, reducing uncertainties in policy and expanding its scope to corporations through regulatory innovation. That way, various jobs can be created and jobs can be created. The number of jobs in advanced countries with advanced service industries is much higher than in Korea. As of 2006, the number of jobs in Korea stood at 10,000, less than half that of the U.S. (3,000) and Japan (25,000).Policy thinking and national interventionism suffocate the market. The biggest ""risk"" in South Korea is now the politics that does not recognize policy failures."

9oci9v,9,2018-10-15,25 Year old story,daniel24561,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9oci9v/25_year_old_story/,"If you have the patience to read my story it would mean the world to me.  I will try to be as short as possible. Basically I have had panic disorder and anxiety with agoraphobia for many years. Never did anything about it until it got worst lets say 5-6 years ago. Went to college started drinking and as you can imagine the 2-3 beers that calmed my anxiety increased to larger amounts.Tolerance was relatively low as I wasn’t a drinker at all before turning 20, but yes it took the edge off so there it began. Drinking daily in college for around 3 good years, not a huge amount as mentioned earlier due to low tolerance. 

Then 3 years ago when the alcool got out of control I was dealing with three problems (anxiety, alcohol, and panic attacks) and I had to seek help. Started having withdrawals and going back home to my parents from university I couldn’t hide my drinking easily. I got he courage to tell my mother and I was put in Xanax and fluoxetine. It worked I stopped drinking for 2 years. Took Xanax as needed for my panic attacks. Even though it’s not meant for long term it helped quit a lot. Move abroad for an internship experience, didn’t drink one drop. Surrounded by a lot of drinkers and young people having a good time I resisted amazingly and did a lot of things that I never imagined without drinking such as stadiums. Crowds, subway. However I lost all contact with friends I felt isolated as a non drinker my age 

Then a year ago I moved to a new place all alone quite difficult, and then yes started drinking again to be more sociable go out and have a good time. And here I am again with huge daily alcohol consumption especially recently. I know loneliness has had a major impact on this I am an only child as well.

My mother realized on a recent trip together that something was off with me, I was drinking heavily and she realized I was acting very dizzy she told me to go see someone especially that the withdrawals were heavy 

I went to see a psychiatrist who prescribed me some Zoloft which helped a bit. I stopped drinking for a month basically which was a big achievement but I always say “just this one time” won’t hurt me 

And now boom yesterday I went out with my work colleagues got totally smashed and I am basically a joke now. It’s like the third time i get wasted in front of colleagues, and I missed work the next day because of this. And now everyone is talking about it

I also feel that I am not in control, for example I can’t stop like a bigger power drags me to the bar and order more. I also have a problem that I drink everything so fast, I don’t know why! A pint of beer Is always chugged and it takes like 5-10 minutes It’s so scary, and then of course the blackouts where I don’t remember a single thing. Can be due to the medication or just my mind is easier to blackouts... 

Please share your experiences if similar, I’m only 25 this is horrible. I don’t want my colleagues to think I’m crazy and that’s what I’m starting to feel now. The vicious circle of anxiety panic attacks drinking doesn’t end. 

I feel like I’m in a outer space detached from reality 

Anyone else at a young age have this? I feel that it’s tough to find a psychiatrist that would even understand

9ocimk,4,2018-10-15,My first post... Really stressing out...,torycory,AskParents,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/9ocimk/my_first_post_really_stressing_out/,"I was recently going to graduate school for my MSW after taking a year off after earning my bachelor's degree. I completed my first semester of grad school and then in the beginning of my second semester I became very sick and was in the hospital, causing me to miss too many days which I then needed to withdraw completely. During my 1 year medical leave I began working full time again and I realized how much happier I felt than when I was in school.  I know in my heart that I will go back to school eventually because this has been my goal/dream for quite some time, I dread going back to school in a few months SO much. My parents have been dropping hints every once in a while and asking ""you're going back to school, right?"", saying that it would be a complete waste of time and money considering they paid for my undergrad. The thing is, I love my job now so much and I absolutely love working full time doing something I both really enjoy and that's related to my field of study. 

This passed year has been the happiest I've felt in a very long time. I've had so much more time to do things for myself, I am much less stressed and depressed, and I am saving much more money than I was when working part time and in school.  I have to contact my school at the end of the month in order to go back in January. I'm really stressed out about telling my parents I've been feeling this way because I'm very concerned that they'll be angry, frustrated, and essentially, disappointed. I know they are going to tell me that the longer I wait to go back, the harder it's going to be to get back into the swing of things. No part of me feels that I'll never go back, because I still want to earn my MSW and get a better paying job some day. But as of right now, I am so content, I love my job and I get so depressed just thinking about all of the homework, studying, stress, internship, and how miserable I was when in grad school.

Basically, I need advice on whether just going back to school and getting it over with, while also not upsetting my parents, is a better idea.
Or should I stick to my gut feelings? And take another year off before going back to grad school once again.  I'm not getting any younger (25) and I don't want to look back and feel like I wasted my time taking more time off before completing another year and a half of my Masters degree. "
9ocyn8,1,2018-10-15,To Write A Story,poor_icarus,u_poor_icarus,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_poor_icarus/comments/9ocyn8/to_write_a_story/,"As my time as an intern fast approaches an ending, I have to prepare a slide and present before I go. Azin said the slide has to convey a story, and what does a story have?

Of course, this is something I've been trying to decipher for the past years. What a story is and what makes a good one. The first thought that came to mind was Kurt Vonnegut's theory, but I feel like I should go deeper and uncover something simpler and basal. 

Really, Azin was right, as always -- what is the story, really? What am I trying to tell? What had I gone through and how did the journey change me? 

Two years ago I was a small town boy new to the city, I was hitchhiking rides from strangers and taking photographs of the dirty homeless people at transit stations and every night I wrote in the dark to a lover I never met. Now, what I've become? And what happened between Point A, which is then, and Point B, which is now? 

Let's zoom out and see the bigger picture, which I don't think anyone will ever understand because many of the connecting fragments of memories are lost, but there are enough to make sense of the things that happened.

In my mind, I can still see seventeen-year-old me with cropped black hair, standing on the side of a lonely highway in denim shorts with his thumb sticking up, wishing the sun would stop dipping so that the dogs wouldn't come out. And when a car would stop for him, he would climb in without a second thought and give a fake name and a fake hometown to the driver. 

I thought that boy was gone from the mirrors, but now I understand that he has always been here all along, except that the game is more dangerous now. Instead of cars, there are now planes and alcohol and money and all the seven sins. 

I talked to Finny about this, because I think he may be one of the youngest friends I have now, and he told me how sad it is for me to have to play this game to realize some dreams. True, but I'm getting impatient to start from scratch and wait. And youth is a valuable form of currency.

Finny, the pale tall blond, maybe one day I'll visit him for the weekend, if there's a fate for that. He reminds me of Michael, regarding how he is sometimes depressed. Except Finny doesn't drink. And Finny is alive. And he is in southern Germany, not in LA, California.  

Life, I've been told that the days are slow but the years are fast. And I find that true. Day by day you don't see things coming and going, or changing in general, but after a year or ten, you look back and you can see how unpredictable life is. How crazy the turns of events are. 

So many chapters in my life go unrecorded, but they return when the wind brings a familiar smell or the radio plays a specific song. I remember, I just don't retell as much anymore. 

When I take a nap at work during one of the breaks, I see flashing images of events from this year. The lights in the tunnel racing past me as I drove fast. The black and white cat that always slept at the stairs. The pair of eyes of everyone I ever loved, the way they gazed at me, all having the same expression of pity. 

Will I end up strangled and dead under a bed like Venus Xtravaganza, or will I make it and write that happy end?

Will my story be a tale of passion and faithful courage or a cautionary tale of recklessness? 

I was told by psychics and astrologers that I was born under the right stars, but we all know that in the end, you forge your own destiny. You either catch that plane and have an adventure, or you stay in your small town, safe but constalty wondering what could have been.

Azin, how am I supposed to tell a story when the biggest arc of my life only begins as soon as I leave the workforce? 

I don't know the ""Story of QC."" But I do know the story of ""Qimmy in QC."" Which would include a lot of struggles and confusion and anxiety and rebellion, but in the end, there's friendship and domestication. 

Really, I don't regret joining the workforce here. I learned a lot. Even the brief exposure to a real working environment has been priceless. Because now I know what to expect in the future and I get to decide my path better now. 

Sure, there are other things too, such as the professional skills -- discipline, communication, etc -- but those elements are present out of work too. "

9odrkd,11,2018-10-15,How do I stop treading water? I'm looking to get more financial independence and look toward moving somewhere warmer.,thesemenarenihilists,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9odrkd/how_do_i_stop_treading_water_im_looking_to_get/,"I've lived in the same midwest region for the last six years of my life, and it seems I've never been able to get ahead, and I'm just treading water. I'm willing and fully accept my personal responsibility in this. I moved back to this area to take an unpaid internship on a political campaign, after managing a coffee shop in a major city for $8.00 an hour. 

Since then, I've waited tables in fine dining for three years, managed two political campaigns and worked for a lobbying organization, and now have used that to get into journalism. 

And I like my job well enough, I suppose, but it's for a podunk small town newspaper  where I have no growth potential and I make $13.00 an hour. I drive 13 miles each way every day to work in an 30 year old car that gets maybe 15 mpg, as that was all I could afford. 

I'm in my mid 30's, and I hate winter, and would like to begin planning a better life, as I build my skill set, debate grad school and  keep up to date on my SQL/HTML/CSS and Adobe and graphics design. Hopefully to move to a larger area and have some more stability and better weather, parks, hiking, etc. 

Sorry if that intro is rambling, I just thought some context would be helpful. 

So currently my take home pay is $750 every two weeks. That's after my matched 3% 401k contribution, health care which comes to 66.65 every two weeks and taxes. After almost 8 months at my job, I have about $420 vested in my index fund 401k at work.

My bills are 300 a month for rent, 100 for bills and dog food. 50 for gym and 50 for phone. about 200/300 for food, I've been meal prepping as much as I can, and while previously admittedly have been bad about going out to eat, haven't gone out to eat in nearly a month, and will not be going out. 

So my bills are about a combined 800 a month out of my $1500 take home pay, leaving me at best 700 for saving, car repairs, gas, and emergencies or as it is currently, trying to get new glasses for the first time in almost six years. 

I get paid this Friday, the 19th, and then I'll have three more paychecks by the 1st of December. I also sold my beloved motorcycle in part to help cover cost of car repairs to get to work, and I sold it back to my best friend's dad, an older boomer who originally owned the bike, and gave me a good deal on it. He will be giving me another $750 for it shortly. Theoretically after November and December rent, that will give me about something around 2200 left that I'd like to save to potentially having actual savings and use towards relocation expenses as well. 

I am also trying to get my credit back in order, I was offered a credit card with $49 down, but I put $150 down so I could get at least 250 in credit available. I don't plan to use it at all, except to maybe pay my phone bill and then autopay it every month. I just wanted to work towards getting my score back up.

How can I best live as frugally as possible within these parameters and continue to save to hopefully find warmer residence? How do I get out of the midwest on a journalist's salary? Winter is coming. "
9ody0i,0,2018-10-15,I (26M) would like some outside advice on my new relationship (22f),TylerLyons,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ody0i/i_26m_would_like_some_outside_advice_on_my_new/,"I got divorced back in February and was sleeping/dating around until early September when I met an amazing woman on a dating app. We started things off really slow for the first week (hung out twice) or so but the chemistry is insanely strong and we share the same values and enjoy the same things. The second week we hung out 3 times and by hung out I mean as soon as we get out of work we meet up and spend the entire night together and stay at each others place. By the third week we agreed to spend every spare moment we had together and we still do and have a wonderful time and it really is special.

Here is where it gets complicated. The week before I met her she tried to break up with her long distance boyfriend but he offered open relationship. She took him up on the offer but then she met me and cut it off with him a week into seeing me. There is no hang-up that I know of, we spend all day together and text constantly when we are apart and I have never once got any suspicion that she is still in to him, we are both very honest and up front. She is an intern for a very specific field and while there are jobs available for her in my area her internship ends mid November. She has stated and we have discussed that she is going to try to find a job in our current location but it is not 100% that she will be able to.

We are both extremely warm to eachother, constantly laughing and have gotten into a solid routine of working out, cooking dinner, going out with our friends together, etc. She has invited me to come visit her hometown on the other side of the US during the holidays however Christmas dinner with the family probably won’t happen as it is still probably too soon for that but who knows. After her internship and lease end in November she is going to stay with me until Thanksgiving and then leave her vehicle and belongings at my house while she travels to visit her grandparents.

In two weeks her friend is coming to visit and her friend is a bit wild, I have made it clear that I am looking for more and would like to become officially exclusive. She has stated that she only wants me, is not interested in anyone else or looking for anyone else, and she is head over heels for me. When her friend comes however she wants the option to be able to “have fun” which she says is just to maybe dance with some guys and kiss them but she doesn’t even know if she will be able to do that because she has such strong feelings for me and isn’t looking for anyone else. I respect that because she just got out of a relationship. She has agreed to enter exclusivity with me the day after her friend leaves.

Her father whom she is extremely close to came to visit last week and she brought me to dinner with him twice. We travelled to another city and she met my brother this previous weekend, everything seems to be going on track but I am just a little uneasy about her not being able to commit. I understand that she just got out of a relationship, we haven’t been seeing eachother for that long, and everything and I am not sure why I feel this way. Just looking for an outside opinion, what does everyone else think of this situation? Am I overthinking things or are there red flags I am not considering? Are we moving way too fast? Am I a rebound?

Also I realize I made a typo in the title she is 22 (22F) not 26.

TL;DR Met an amazing woman who is equally into me. She is hesitant to commit after recently coming out of a long distance relationship but says she only wants me and we have met each other’s family already and spend every day/night that we can together. Am I overthinking things or should I approach with more caution?"
9odyyf,24,2018-10-15,I am a Freelance filmmaker of 4 years. I'm here to share my experiences and answer questions about going from a beginner filmmaker to feeling settled and happy in my career.,Adam-West,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/9odyyf/i_am_a_freelance_filmmaker_of_4_years_im_here_to/,"Hi!

I am a filmmaker who has been freelance for the past 4 years or so. I started straight out of Uni (a non-film related course) and am entirely self-taught. Last year I made £44,000 of which I kept about £34,000. Next year my aim is to make £55,000 and keep £45,000. I feel settled and safe in my career and have just won my first ‘real’ filmmaking award. I'm at a stage now where I am busy most weeks and love my job. I will try to give as honest and accurate answers as I can. Feel free to ask any questions you might usually be afraid to ask, although I would prefer to stay anonymous for this post. I know that when starting out, it is hard to visualise how your first few years will play out so I am here to share my experience and hopefully offer advice to new freelancers or anybody looking at a freelance career in film.

**Brief answers to personal questions about kit and rates:**

I started off charging about £140/day when I had a Canon 6d and basic kit. Now I will usually charge somewhere in the region of £440/day for shoots and £300/day for edits. I have a Sony FS7, Canon L-series lenses, phantom 4 drones, Sennheiser G3 radio mics. An NTG2, a Ronin, a Rhino Evo slider, basic lighting kit (I usually rent lights). Might be missing some kit here but you get the idea. The most I’ve ever charged is £650/day for a 7 day shoot. I sometimes offer charities a reduced rate of £300/day for shoots and £200/day for edits but I don’t ever go lower than that. For corporates I wouldn’t accept lower than £400 and £300.

The types of films I make are documentary, branded content and occasionally low budget commercials. I often work in very remote locations and my speciality is international development as that is what I studied at university (hence the charity clients). A normal project for me will be me, a producer, and a sound op. However, occasionally I work with set designers, camera assistants, art directors and gaffers aswell. The most I have ever directed is a crew of 8.

&amp;#x200B;

**The first challenge I faced and will probably be the same for you is imposter syndrome.**

 The hardest thing for me, was going from working a minimum wage bar job as a student, to charging £30/hour as a filmmaker. I always felt like I was over-charging people or ripping them off. You aren't overcharging. Its just that minimum wage is a bad joke. Infact, I found that you become more desirable to clients if you are more expensive, because clients won't want to skimp out for an inferior product. They want it done right, by a professional. Going cheap just makes you look amateur. A good friend of mine says you should work for free, or full rate. And nothing in between. The exception I would say is if you are going to get a lot of work from a client (like a 3 month project), it could be good business to offer a discount. (I'm sure people will debate this last point). Sometimes its really tempting to offer a low rate when theres a project that you really want to do. Resist the urge. It wont help your application. I find you are more likely to put a client off by marketing yourself as ‘the cheap option’ than if you confidently tell them your price. That said, you may need to do a couple of freebies just to start with until you have a portfolio together.  If I was to start again now, I would be looking at small businesses who could do with some online marketing materials, I would get a mirrorless camera with a good microphone and a decent second hand tripod with a slider. Then I would charge £200/day for shoots and £150/day for edits. Up your rates every time you land a new client. Don’t ever justify your rates if you don’t have to. Nothing screams I don’t know what I’m worth more than ‘I am charging £200/day because of this and that…’. Instead just say ‘I charge £200/day for shoots.’ And leave it at that. The next person to speak loses.

**Hold your nerve.** 

Freelancing is scary as shit to start with. I moved to London which is an incredibly expensive place to live. 2 weeks later, I thought I was going to have to move home because I had no work. Bear with it. and email everybody you know who's remotely connected to the industry. It's always the ones you least expect that will come through for you. (And those you expect to help you out never seem to).

**Practice like crazy**,

I practiced day and night to get good at making films. This element is pretty obvious. Spend all your free time on vimeo. Analyse the staff picks, make sure you understand everything that is going on in the image. Learn lighting techniques. Analyse your weak points and spend time in the bath thinking about how to improve them. Even if you plan on being a director, you still need to have a basic understanding of how lighting works, how to direct your DoP etc..

**Learn how to run a business and how to interact with your clients**

Despite that last point, being able to make good films is just one of many pre-requisites to becoming a filmmaker. What I didn't practice for was running a business and learning about client relationships. I know filmmakers who are successful largely because they are lovely people to work with, they work hard, and they know how to run their business. **Clients will often go with who they know and like the most, not the most skilled worker.** If you are going on a shoot in Spain for 10 days, you want to take somebody that you can have a drink with at the end of the day. If a client invites you to the pub, go. And try as hard as you can to build a reputation as somebody who is easy to work with.

I had never worked in an office before going freelance, and I don’t think I understood how informal this industry is. Don’t try too hard to sound professional. Keep your emails relatively casual (although no swearing). You are a human so act like one. A few days ago I had a client who I had never worked for before WhatsApp me ‘*Yo yo, have you any availability for three days this week?’* Not that I’m saying you have to be this informal, but you get the jist.

**Don’t be afraid to tell your client that you can improve their idea.**

This is a tricky one to start with as it requires confidence. But if a client approaches me now and says for example ‘I want an event film’. I usually ask why? Often they don’t really know, its just that they have an event planned and have money to make a film. I might then say ‘i don’t think event films are always the best way to get your message across, however, what some of my other clients prefer is to make a series of short clips to use on twitter and instagram.’ Obviously if they have a specific set idea, don’t shit all over it. But don’t forget that they hired you for professional advice aswell as your shooting abilities. Clients will usually appreciate guidance in this way. Theres no such thing as a boring project, if it’s boring then you aren’t doing your job as a filmmaker to make your client something interesting that people actually want to watch. I was making corporate ‘about us’ talking head type videos for one client for years, then I thought, why am I bothering to take their money to make films nobody watched and don’t do them any good? So I arranged to chat to the company director and said, I think we are doing this wrong and we could do something better. So we then used budget for three of these talking head type films and made something really good fun with professional actors and scriptwriters.

**Find mentors/peers.** 

Speak to people that you know in the industry, chat to each other when you need advice. The one thing I really don't like about freelancing is that you have no official mentor. Salaried workers get told when they're doing something wrong by a senior staff member. Freelancers don't get that luxury (unless you really screw things up). So be cautious when you're still learning. If you hear a term that you don't understand, write it down and look it up. Always try to keep learning and get better, and get obsessed with your craft.

Lastly, if a client offers you a lower rate and promises that next time they will pay you better. Don't believe those lying cheap bastards! **If a client pays well. They pay well from the start.** If they start off low, you can bet your life they wont get any better. And while we're at it. Don’t get too excited if an email is headed ‘Great opportunity’ It’s most likely gonna end up in your spam box after you read it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions I wished i'd known the answers to when I started**

&amp;#x200B;

***What kit should I buy?***

I personally think you should aim to spend every spare penny on kit for your first few years if you are the kind of filmmaker that has their own kit. Obviously buy the right stuff but remember you can always sell it on. The small mirrorless cameras these days are awesome, and they will serve you well for a couple of years. But trade up as soon as you feel you can justify it. In my opinion you will never be seen as a real pro until you have a proper documentary camera as your A cam. Not that I personally believe this, but your clients will. If you disagree with this, I’d like to hear your thoughts, but from my perspective, a corporate client that doesn’t know about film will see a diddy little mirrorless and feel ripped off if you are charging good money. Depending on what kind of work you do it might pay to rent. I know a few that do this and it works for them. For me personally I think I’m better off with my own kit. Although I always rent lights as they tend to be different for each shoot. With all this in mind, please don’t expect good kit to make you a good filmmaker. Ultimately your kit is just your tools, and if you can’t make a good film handheld, you probably wont make one with a MoCo rig and expensive lenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Below I have written three tiers of kit that I think you should aim to get, this is just a rough guide though based on what I would do if I was to start again.

&amp;#x200B;

*Tier 1:*

Best mirrorless you can afford, second hand tripod, rode videomic +extension chord and mic stand, 3x cheap LED's from amazon and some gels. Cheap slider rail. Possibly a zion gimbal for the client gimmicks. Hard drive AND A BACKUP DRIVE. Don't skip out on backing up. It's like the cheapest element of your kit and you will be humiliated when you lose a project. Trust me, you don't need that in your life.

*Tier 2:*

Sony A7sii or Panasonic GH4 or something, (I would go for the sony as when you trade up to an FS7 you can keep the same lens mounts and you can keep it as a b-cam as it will cut better together)., Canon or Tamron 24-70mm lens +adapter. Possibly the sigma Art 24-70 on E-mount if you get the Sony. Keep the Zion gimbal, tripod and LEDS from the last tier. Sell the old camera. Buy decent radio mics such as Sennheiser G3. Decent shotgun mic such as NTG2 or 3. XLR adapter for the A7sii. I also bought a camera cage with a big external battery for the A7sii.

*Tier 3*

Phantom 4 drone, (I personally am not a fan of the camera on the Mavic., phantom is cheaper and works better for me). Sony FS7 body (Keep the a7sii if you can afford to as a B-cam/backup). Some prime lenses (probably sigma art or Canon L series.) Rhino Evo Slider rail. Ronin-Mx if you have kept the A7sii (an FS7 wont fit), Ronin (the large one) if you sold the A7sii. Decent kit case on rollers and maybe a padded backpack aswell.

&amp;#x200B;

***‘Where do you find your work?’***

Until about a year ago, pretty much all my work came from word of mouth. I could probably trace all my current clients back to one or two jobs that I did at the start. One was for a small local charity for basically just expenses. The charity director’s son worked for a recruitment company who then paid me a real rate to make some corporate stuff for them. Another client was a large international charity that I did a short internship for. They ended up being my best client for about 3 years and I’m still on very good terms with them (although they mostly use in-house filmmakers now). Since January I feel like a turned a corner and people started finding me online. I also have an agent. I’d say this is probably unlikely to happen until your portfolio is strong enough to compete with others who have been working for a few years at least. 

Also, don't panic if you can't see where your next job is coming from. Things tend to come through the woodwork. I currently have about 4 days in my diary for the next few months. But if the past is anything to go by, i'll probably be working 3-4 days a week this month and next.

***How do you decide your rates?’***

Some people will tell you it’s a question of accounting for your expenses and lifestyle. I personally think that’s not very useful for a new filmmaker. I think you just start to get a feel for what’s appropriate. Like I said before, I rarely lose out by going too high, they will normally come back to me and say I’m too expensive and I then ask if we can work something out. I have however, lost work due to being too cheap. Just don’t be ridiculous. As previously mentioned, if I was to start again, I'd start at £200/day for shoots and £150/day for edits. Then increase rates as steeply as I feel comfortable with, with each new client.

***How does the hiring process work?***

Usually the process will go like this. A previous client of yours will recommend you to their friend in another company who needs a filmmaker. They then go on your website, they see if you look good but really this is just a formality as the most important thing if your recommendation, they then call you up and either ask straight off how much your rates are and if you are interested, or if they are an creative agency or prod company you will normally go in for a chat. Bring a laptop with some work to show them if this is the case as they may not have had time to view your reel. They will then pencil in pre-limenary non-binding dates with you. Try to get these firmed up asap.

***Good luck! Feel free to ask if you have questions. I will try to keep an eye on this post for the rest of the day. Let me know if you disagree with anything I’ve said. You are in for an adventure!!***

**TL:DR There isn’t one. I put effort into this and it might teach you something you don’t know.**"

I was making corporate ‘about us’ talking head type videos for one client for years, then I thought, why am I bothering to take their money to make films nobody watched and don’t do them any good? So I arranged to chat to the company director and said, I think we are doing this wrong and we could do something better. So we then used budget for three of these talking head type films and made something really good fun with professional actors and scriptwriters.

**Find mentors/peers.**

Speak to people that you know in the industry, chat to each other when you need advice. The one thing I really don't like about freelancing is that you have no official mentor. Salaried workers get told when they're doing something wrong by a senior staff member. Freelancers don't get that luxury (unless you really screw things up). So be cautious when you're still learning. If you hear a term that you don't understand, write it down and look it up. Always try to keep learning and get better, and get obsessed with your craft.

Lastly, if a client offers you a lower rate and promises that next time they will pay you better. Don't believe those lying cheap bastards! **If a client pays well. They pay well from the start.** If they start off low, you can bet your life they wont get any better. And while we're at it. Don’t get too excited if an email is headed ‘Great opportunity’ It’s most likely gonna end up in your spam box after you read it.

**Questions I wished i'd known the answers to when I started**

***What kit should I buy?***

I personally think you should aim to spend every spare penny on kit for your first few years if you are the kind of filmmaker that has their own kit. Obviously buy the right stuff but remember you can always sell it on. The small mirrorless cameras these days are awesome, and they will serve you well for a couple of years. But trade up as soon as you feel you can justify it. In my opinion you will never be seen as a real pro until you have a proper documentary camera as your A cam. Not that I personally believe this, but your clients will. If you disagree with this, I’d like to hear your thoughts, but from my perspective, a corporate client that doesn’t know about film will see a diddy little mirrorless and feel ripped off if you are charging good money. Depending on what kind of work you do it might pay to rent. I know a few that do this and it works for them. For me personally I think I’m better off with my own kit. Although I always rent lights as they tend to be different for each shoot. With all this in mind, please don’t expect good kit to make you a good filmmaker. Ultimately your kit is just your tools, and if you can’t make a good film handheld, you probably wont make one with a MoCo rig and expensive lenses.

Below I have written three tiers of kit that I think you should aim to get, this is just a rough guide though based on what I would do if I was to start again.

*Tier 1:*

Best mirrorless you can afford, second hand tripod, rode videomic +extension chord and mic stand, 3x cheap LED's from amazon and some gels. Cheap slider rail. Possibly a zion gimbal for the client gimmicks. Hard drive AND A BACKUP DRIVE. Don't skip out on backing up. It's like the cheapest element of your kit and you will be humiliated when you lose a project. Trust me, you don't need that in your life.

*Tier 2:*

Sony A7sii or Panasonic GH4 or something, (I would go for the sony as when you trade up to an FS7 you can keep the same lens mounts and you can keep it as a b-cam as it will cut better together)., Canon or Tamron 24-70mm lens +adapter. Possibly the sigma Art 24-70 on E-mount if you get the Sony. Keep the Zion gimbal, tripod and LEDS from the last tier. Sell the old camera. Buy decent radio mics such as Sennheiser G3. Decent shotgun mic such as NTG2 or 3. XLR adapter for the A7sii. I also bought a camera cage with a big external battery for the A7sii.

*Tier 3*

Phantom 4 drone, (I personally am not a fan of the camera on the Mavic., phantom is cheaper and works better for me). Sony FS7 body (Keep the a7sii if you can afford to as a B-cam/backup). Some prime lenses (probably sigma art or Canon L series.) Rhino Evo Slider rail. Ronin-Mx if you have kept the A7sii (an FS7 wont fit), Ronin (the large one) if you sold the A7sii. Decent kit case on rollers and maybe a padded backpack aswell.

***‘Where do you find your work?’***

Until about a year ago, pretty much all my work came from word of mouth. I could probably trace all my current clients back to one or two jobs that I did at the start. One was for a small local charity for basically just expenses. The charity director’s son worked for a recruitment company who then paid me a real rate to make some corporate stuff for them. Another client was a large international charity that I did a short internship for. They ended up being my best client for about 3 years and I’m still on very good terms with them (although they mostly use in-house filmmakers now). Since January I feel like a turned a corner and people started finding me online. I also have an agent. I’d say this is probably unlikely to happen until your portfolio is strong enough to compete with others who have been working for a few years at least.

Also, don't panic if you can't see where your next job is coming from. Things tend to come through the woodwork. I currently have about 4 days in my diary for the next few months. But if the past is anything to go by, i'll probably be working 3-4 days a week this month and next.

***How do you decide your rates?’***

Some people will tell you it’s a question of accounting for your expenses and lifestyle. I personally think that’s not very useful for a new filmmaker. I think you just start to get a feel for what’s appropriate. Like I said before, I rarely lose out by going too high, they will normally come back to me and say I’m too expensive and I then ask if we can work something out. I have however, lost work due to being too cheap. Just don’t be ridiculous. As previously mentioned, if I was to start again, I'd start at £200/day for shoots and £150/day for edits. Then increase rates as steeply as I feel comfortable with, with each new client.

***How does the hiring process work?***

Usually the process will go like this. A previous client of yours will recommend you to their friend in another company who needs a filmmaker. They then go on your website, they see if you look good but really this is just a formality as the most important thing if your recommendation, they then call you up and either ask straight off how much your rates are and if you are interested, or if they are an creative agency or prod company you will normally go in for a chat. Bring a laptop with some work to show them if this is the case as they may not have had time to view your reel. They will then pencil in pre-limenary non-binding dates with you. Try to get these firmed up asap.

***Good luck! Feel free to ask if you have questions. I will try to keep an eye on this post for the rest of the day. Let me know if you disagree with anything I’ve said. You are in for an adventure!!***

**TL:DR There isn’t one. I put effort into this and it might teach you something you don’t know.**"

1)
I want to know what is the effect of the various options in the google account settings.

- Disable personalized ads

In case I deactivated all possible options what's the change?
As far as I understand the wording - google is still processing all of the data, but is just not using it to show me personalized ads.

Are they still collection all of it? 
Are they still building a profile based on google cookies, Gmail and the various other sources.
I didn't mentioned the possible opt-outed maps history, web history etc. on purpose. Because there's so much more data/metadata which is collected, processed and analized.

2) 
Is there a difference between having/using a google account and the processing in an ""shadow"" profile? 
(e.g. FB is known for building profiles of individuals without having a FB account)

3) Are they any sources in the internet where former workes, interns etc. shed some light on these processes inside Google?

Thank you very much in advance !

Today I have had a hard day. Splitting episode is strong, self-hate is strong, anxiety is high, and sadness is never ending. I dissociated and have been in and out of it today. I asked my internship if I could skip out today since I would not be present and I needed time to myself. I feel really guilty about this..like they will all abandon me and I love them to death. I feel like I should have broke myself free and just went to the meeting. I can't shake it because I know doing something productive is good for me, but I'm torn because it wasn't necessarily where I wanted to be to help myself in that moment.

Along with that, I feel guilty for placing my problems onto my friends. I should be happy and positive since nothing major happened today. I feel like they are all going to leave me now because I get into these weird moods (not necessarily dissociate or split, but rapidly changing moods) nearly everyday and it takes a toll especially since my fp keeps suggesting things to help me feel better and they never seem to work. Now she has been distant and my other friends too. I have no idea what to do. I feel guilty for just being around, like I am unchanging landscape.

Does anyone have any tips? General discussion is welcomed too. I appreciate everyone's honesty."

I'm writing this message in a time of despair.

I used to be a daily smoker for the last year or so.
I've been addicted for 6 years, with times worse than others, and a few breaks here and there, but after I moved out and got my own place a year ago, I've been smoking a joint more or less daily.

I have never had any problems with this plant, and I've been able to get good grades in school always (straight A's).

About 2 weeks ago, I got home from my job where I'm doing an internship, and had a nice toke on my pipe with weed and kief.
It seemed to be just another day, but after I had toked up I got utterly and extremely stoned - like, way more than usual.
I enjoyed it in the moment, but knew something was up.

The day after I went to work, and I felt more tired than usual.
The later the day went by, the more tired I got, and when the day was over I was more exhausted than ever.

That afternoon, I decided I wanted to quit, and the next night I smoked the rest of my stash and threw out all my utensils.

The following couple of days were AWFUL.
I've been taking breaks from smoking several hundred times before, and there has NEVER been any problems.
What I've always loved about weed, is how you can smoke your brain out in the evening, and wake up well rested the next day, like nothing ever happened.

This time is different though..

When I woke up, I was just a tiny bit tired.
I went to work, got a few cups of coffee and a cigarette, and everything was alright.
But the closer we get to noon, the more tired, burned out, and just over-all crashed I got.
When I left work at 4 pm, my eyes were as red as when I had smoked a bong hit!

I figured it was just the first couple of days, but after a full week, with no signs of this getting better, I was worried for my health and well-being.

I read somewhere here that a cold turkey could be the cause of this, and that the person smoked just a few times when he needed that extra energy, so a full week after my initial quitting, I smoked 1 small bowl of weed I had saved.
This made me just as stoned as a week before, and I felt horrible afterwards - so in the trash the entire grinder went.

Now it's been 3 days since that time, and my situation doesn't seem to get better.
At around 10 am, my eyes starts to get irritated and red, and at 2 pm they're completely rouge, and the ""fog"" is making me uncapable of doing anything other than looking dead in the screen and randomly clicking on things without any thought or meaning.

I work in service field, helping others on a daily basis, so naturally it's extremely worrying when I see myself in the mirror.
I LOOK stoned, and I fear the people I service will think this as well, since I've been here for 3 months without having these signs at all.

So, basically;
 - I quit after a bad bowl of weed and kief
 - Never had problems taking breaks for days/a week
 - Days after, my eyes are red, and my head is foggy and dull
 - After a week, no signs of improvements 
 - Tiredness always kicks in after 3-5 hours of being awake"

As he jumps off, my keyboard cable gets caught around his paw and he pulls down my $900 PC tower from the 4 ft high table it sits on, and completely destroys it.  

I'm a college student and I legit have no money to fix it.  I spent most of my summer savings on this computer less than 2 months ago because my old one died after 5 years and I told myself to buy it because it's something that I'll use for a long time.  

I'm in my final year of college.  Internship year which means way less money than usual.   All my papers, thesis, projects, etc is on that computer.

It gave me an anxiety attack, followed by me hiding under my blankets for an hour and a half.  

This may sound stupid to a lot of you, but this was the one thing I had that costs a lot of money.  It's absolutely ruined.

9oh16c,2,2018-10-15,In a tough spot with regards to an outstanding Internship offer,duckfallasbdn,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9oh16c/in_a_tough_spot_with_regards_to_an_outstanding/,"Hey I'm a senior in college and I'm being offered an internship by a big 4 firm but I'm in a weird spot timing wise; A little background:

I'm currently finishing up my BBA with a major in Accounting. I got to school in Baltimore but I'm from Philadelphia and plan on moving back there after school. After graduating I want to use my summer to intern with a major firm before returning to school in the fall to complete my masters and meet the 150 credit hour requirement to sit for the CPA exam.
So I applied to several firms this fall and have interviewed with 3 of them. All of the internships I applied for are summer internships in Philadelphia. One firm called me back yesterday saying that because of how many applicants they receive for summer internships and how competitive it is they didn't know if I'd be able to get a spot (I have a 3.2 GPA and a 3.3 in my Accounting classes, and I several years of summer work experience including 1 internship at a smaller firm). As a result they want to offer me a winter internship that I could do in Baltimore rather than Philly. They are going to have several people call/email me to give me the exact details sometime this week (ie; hours, pay, job description, etc;). I'm not sure what I should do because I'm likely to hear back from another firm that I've applied to this week; and if I could get a summer internship with them over the current offer on the table I'd prefer that; but at the same time I don't want to risk not getting an offer from them. 

As of now I'm leaning more towards accepting the winter offer outright because it would give me some experience working during busy season and I don't have a heavy workload with classes next semester. I guess this leaves me with 2 main questions:

What should I do this week? (with regards to the offer and potentially having an interview with a different firm)

If anyone here has interned during the winter for a big 4; how was it and what should I expect out of it?

&amp;nbsp;

Wally West and Donna Troy stumbled down the busy streets. In his hand, Wally held a plastic bag, swinging it back and forth as he walked. Inside was a copy of *Troika: Night Hunters*, a brand new video game still in its protective packaging. It was sold out in most stores across the country, leading to Donna accompanying Wally in his search state to state until he finally found a copy in Gotham.

The city was a new beast. Gotham would always be entrenched in darkness, but now - liberated from the mad Mayor Nygma - it was a lighter place. If that was even possible.

As they walked, navigating through the still unrelenting crowds, Donna smiled and jabbed Wally playfully in the ribs. “We raced across four states to find you your game, you do realise what this means, right?”

“No?” Wally shot back, before the realisation that he was doomed rapidly beset him.

Three hours later, they emerged from the last shop in a long Main Street. Over her shoulders Donna effortlessly carried ten cardboard shopping bags. She wasn’t much of  a girly girl. In her baggy jeans and leather jacket, that much was clear. But she’d seen a white, off-the-shoulder top in a shop window that she just *had* to get. Then after that, the purchases kept rolling in. The only problem was that Donna was pretty certain she’d completely exhausted most of the savings Dick had put aside for her. 

She sighed to herself, simultaneously feeling pleased with herself and incredibly guilty. Living in a materialistic society was *hard*.

“Can we finally just head home now?” Wally groaned, his legs weary from all the stopping and starting. There wasn’t even any seating free outside any of the changing rooms on the street. 

“Oh,” Donna turned to face him, smiling devilishly, “You never had to stay. I’d have been happy doing all of this alone.” Just to twist the knife some more.

“Riiight,” Wally smiled. “You owe me a pizza!”

“Fine, but—”

Donna suddenly came to a stop along the still bustling sidewalk. Multiple men and women scoffed as they bumped into her, forced to push awkwardly by. But Donna paid them no attention. She was entranced. The sun was high in the sky, its shimmering lights reflecting off the many high rising, corporate towers, before finally being split by the spire of the Gotham Cathedral. The result was a remarkable landscape of cold, modern grey juxtaposed with warm, historical architecture. All bathed in wondrous light.

“Don? You okay?” Wally jabbed her.

“Yes…” she replied, her eyes unmoving. “Since I arrived in New York, I’ve been… studying the landscapes. Watching them move and morph. And here… this is… *beautiful*.”

Wally tried to empathise with her. She’d grown up on an island in the middle of God-knows-which ocean, with strictly Ancient Greek decor. A big urban city must have been awfully strange for her. But at the same time, Wally itched to get moving. Unlike Donna, he was acutely aware of every single perturbed passer-by. It was a busy street. It was *Gotham*. All the streets were busy. 

“Well, can you take a picture?” Wally interjected, “It’ll last longer, and we can’t stand in the middle of the street all day.”

“A picture?” Donna asked, her eyes still fixed on the vista ahead.

“Like the security footage we go through, but still,” Wally explained, surprised she wasn’t more familiar at this point, “Like a painting.”

“I always used to paint with Diana between sparring sessions…”

“Well…” Wally juggled his carrier bag and dug his smartphone out of his pocket. He pulled up the camera app and threw it forward towards Donna. “Just point and click.”

The food court Dick Grayson sat in was one of many on the GU campus. He often tried to beat the rush by getting lunch an hour or two early, in between classes. On his plate, Dick toyed with some southern-fried chicken that looked more than cheap. But that didn’t bother him. He’d eat anything that wasn’t rotten, that was the way on the streets. Still, he preferred the food from the orphanage canteen.

Dick placed his phone on the table as he spoke into his wireless earphones. “So what’s the runtime?”

“Eleven hours, twenty-three minutes and fifty-nine seconds,” Garth replied through the phone, his English accented voice still slightly timid. 

Dick winced. “Oof, I dunno, man. I could do a lot in eleven hours.”

“Well, Wally says that an important part in my integration to human society is to study pop culture. And I’m honestly confused by the fantasy genre. I supposed that watching the Lord of the Rings would help me to understand the appeal it has to humans.”

“It’s just a lot to watch back-to-back.”

“I understand,” Garth replied. Dick could hear in his voice that he was disappointed. He almost couldn’t bare to disappoint his friends, but Dick knew he had to use every ounce of his free time to study if he ever hoped to pass his degree alongside his *nighttime activities*. Garth continued, “Unlike you, I don’t have much to fill my days. I’ll talk to you in eleven hours to tell you what I think.”

The line ended, and Dick was with himself again. He wasn’t like Batman. He was a social creature. As confident as he was, Dick was always less so when he was alone. Or rather, with himself. 

He thought of how he really ought to have gotten his houses in order. Things were finally going straight in the *hero gig*, *travelling to parallel dimensions aside*, but then there was Babs. They’d been talking more than they had in a long time, but Dick knew there was still plenty she wasn’t telling him. He thought to himself, perhaps it was time he confronted her, demanded to know what was on her mind, and urged her to listen to his case. *Maybe that’d help. Maybe it wouldn’t.* 

He knew he had to talk to her. To get to the bottom of whatever fissure was still left between them. To make Babs see that he loved her unconditionally, legs or no legs. Maybe soon. As soon as he’d find the time, and the confidence. Hopefully before he’d lose his chance to ever say something.

And then there was Kara, who was still AWOL since her cousin, Superman, died protecting Metropolis. She and Dick were close, since back in the orphanage, or so Dick thought before she took off barely saying a word. Last time they texted, Kara said they’d ‘talk later’, and Dick was starting to wonder when ‘later’ was. Maybe she just needed space. Dick knew that grief was a bitch.

And in an instant, a dinner tray came crashing down beside Dick. The young Grayson shot up, only to find Mal Duncan, his tall-and-skinny best friend stood before him in a red hoodie.

“Hey, bro!” Mal smiled excitedly, pushing up the rims of his glasses. 

“Mal, how’s it going!?” Dick wrapped his arms around Mal’s skinny body and hugged him tightly. It had been a while.

“S’been a long summer, dude,” said Mal, “Barely saw you at all.”

“I know, I know!” Dick replied, “But you know how it is: everything at the orphanage, and I’ve been *swamped* with assignments. Who knew math was hard?”

“It’s all good,” Mal smiled. That was what Dick loved about him. He held no grudges. He didn’t care if Dick was the more unreliable friend on the plan, or that Dick would never give him a straight answer for anything. He was just a friend. “I, uh… I actually wanted to introduce you to... Well, you already kinda saw each other, but I thought I would formally... I guess what I wanted to say is that—”

“Hi!” A small girl with curly pigtails jumped out from behind Mal, addressing Dick directly. Mal was almost more startled than Dick was.

Dick immediately realised what was happening, and a half-embarrassed grin spread across his face. He made quick eye contact with Mal before addressing her, beaming a look of pride.

“Hey, I’m—”

“Dick Grayson, yeah, I know,” she interjected enthusiastically, taking his hand and shaking it. “Mal talks about you a lot.”

Mal blushed, scoffing in surprise for a second. Dick shot him a teasing grin. 

“And you’re Karen,” Dick replied in turn. “Mal talks about you a lot too. He told me all about your internship at STAR Labs, that’s insane!”

Karen turned to look at Mal, his cheeks flushed beneath their dark pigment, and took his hand, interlocking her fingers with his. She looked to Dick. “Karen Beecher, at your service. Though it’s actually more of a partnership than an internship.”

“Anyway,” Mal interrupted, “I thought I’d introduce you to Karen formally, as my— as my *girlfriend*, before - you know - you heard it through the grapevine.”

Dick shook his head. “Dude, you gave me enough clues. Beside, what, did you think I’d freak if I found out my best friend was seeing someone without my permission?”

“Well, no, but it’s just—”

Karen cut Mal off with a severe glare. *Better than a jab in the ribs.*

Dick saw what was happening. “Look, Mal. Other people have relationships. They have girlfriends. I get it. Like, I never got jealous of you having parents. It’s cool.”

It wasn’t cool. As proud of Mal as he was, Dick did feel that twinge of pain when he saw them hold hands. When he saw how Karen looked at Mal when Dick said he talked about her to him. Love.

Dick spaced out for a second, leaving Mal to cut in, pulling him back down to Earth. “But yeah, I actually wanted to tell you: there’s this new girl who’s starting at the D&amp;D society. All the other nerds are all over her, but she is *just your type*.”

Maybe it was good he started to look elsewhere, Dick thought to himself. He was a young guy, he deserved to have his options open. Or to prepare himself for Babs’ inevitable rebuff, in the case that he just wasn’t what she needed right now. He kept wondering if he should have tried to make things work with Kory, back at the party. He wasn’t sure. It was a mess. But Dick raised an eyebrow, humouring Mal. “Oh yeah? And what’s my type?”

Mal went to speak but immediately began to broil under Karen’s watchful eye. Was this some kind of running joke? “Well… white… pretty, and… *redhead?”*

Beat.

Dick shrugged. “Well, yeah. What’s her name?”

“Her name’s Gwen.”

Wally shoveled an oversized slice of pepperoni pizza into his mouth, the edges of his lips catching a layer of oily grease. He chomped and grumbled, appreciating the much needed lunch while he chewed loudly and without grace. Across the booth, Donna cut her slice into sections with expert precision, rolling each strip up into parcels before she ate them, taking her time.

In between bouts of mastication, Wally piped up. “Is it just me or is Garth just freaky?”

Donna set aside her knife and fork. “What?”

“Like, the scars, the purple eyes. The water powers,” Wally explained. “I know he’s an Atlantean… or something, but Aquaman doesn’t have purple eyes or like… water shit. I dunno. And he’s so awkward.”

“Says the kid with tomato paste all down his shirt!”

“What? I don’t—” Wally looked down. He did. “Besides, I’m not a kid.”

“I’m sure Barry Allen would say otherwise, Kid Flash,” Donna retorted with a grin. But then she stopped and took a more serious tone. She reached forward, stopping Wally’s hand as he reached for yet another slice. “I’m serious, Wally. Go easy on Garth. I’m sure everything in your society is very new to him. It’s stressful without being called a freak. You never called me a freak, did you?”

“No, but you’re—”

The pizza parlor erupted into hurried gasps and screams. A boom sounded as a heavy wooden table a couple of booths over hit the floor. Patrons all over shot to their feet. Wally and Donna looked to the front door to find two teen girls scrapping; punching and pulling each other’s hair.

“That’s Bella Mendez,” Donna grumbled vigilantly. It was true. Dick’s classmate, Bella Mendez, was going for it, her face contorted into a disgusting rage as she clawed at the other girl, whom Donna didn’t recognise. “I’m getting involved.”

“Don, no, don’t…” Wally protested. But she was already gone.

Donna barreled up to the brawling girls and grabbed Bella Mendez by the scruff of her neck. 

“Get the fuck off me!” Bella immediately swung around to flail at Donna, but couldn’t do much as she found herself hoisted off of the floor. Bella hadn’t even noticed who had intervened, and continued to scream “She can’t get away with this!” 

Donna looked nonchalantly to the other girl, in a pile on the floor, still holding Bella three inches off of the ground. “Maybe you should head outside.”
 
&amp;nbsp;
  
♦ ♦ Ⓣ ♦ ♦
 
&amp;nbsp;

Time had passed. Enough for Bella Mendez and her posse to pack up and leave with their tails between their legs. The pizza parlor manager had been kind enough to not alert the police, and Donna Troy finally had a moment to speak to the other brawling girl. 

Out the front of the pizza place, the girl who had introduced herself as Annabeth Jones held a back of frozen peas to the bruise on the left of her head. She was short, modest, but mighty scrappy-looking. But she lacked the fierceness of Bella Mendez. Donna asked her what had happened, and Annabeth was taking her time to reply.

“She said that…” Annabeth took a deep breath, still winded from the fight. “My dad’s a… police detective. Apparently he arrested her dad for robbing a store.”

“Did he?” Donna asked.

“They found him at the scene, redhanded,” Annabeth replied simply.

“So she picked a fight with you?” Donna asked genuinely confused. Though deep down she knew that whole wars had been fought over more trivial matters.

“Seems like it,” Annabeth sighed. “Thank you for stepping in. Mendez has a mean right hook.”

“It’s alright, honestly.”

“I just hope I didn’t interrupt your date too much.”

Donna’s eyes flashed. “I’m sorry, what?”

“You and the ginger kid?” Annabeth continued, suddenly not so sure of what she’d said, worrying if she’d put her foot in it. “I saw him take off as soon as you got involved.”

“You did?” Donna exclaimed. She looked back into the restaurant. Wally was gone. She looked around the streets leading away. Nothing, until she caught the faintest glimpse of Wally West turning a street corner, following a tall, pale beauty, alongside a dozen-odd other teenage boys. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Donna burst through the secret door in the back of Knock-Out Video, stepping into the secret base of the Titans. But as she entered the open-plan space, she found the place immersed in darkness, with all the lights out except the harsh, fluorescent glow of the flat screen TV. On the couch sat Garth, staring at television footage of a small grey goblin leading two children across a marsh.

“This isn’t an incident, is it?!” Donna exclaimed.

“No, no, no,” Garth replied, his eyes still fixed on the screen, his face barely moving as he spoke. “This is a *fictional, moving picture*.”

Donna shrugged, dismissing Garth. She began to pace around the room, still in darkness. Garth didn’t seem to notice.

“Have you seen Wally?” Donna asked, talking over the sound of the movie. 

After a second’s delay, Garth bobbed up. “Huh? No. I’m pretty sure he’s been avoiding me.”

“He’s not been—” Donna began before cutting herself off. She remembered Wally telling her how Garth creeped him out. Perhaps it was better to not saying anything. “I was with Wally earlier. Then I look after for one second and he disappears off with some girl and a group of other boys.”

“Almost as if he has friends other than us,” Garth snarked, shovelling popcorn into his mouth.

“No, I’ve never seen any of them before. This is something else,” Donna replied. Garth wasn’t listening, he was watching the movie. But Garth was forced to pay attention when a loud and sudden knock sounded at the door of Knock-Out Video.

“Who’s that?” Garth spat.

Donna made her way over to the door, looking through the peephole to find the familiar face of Annabeth Jones. Then, when Donna didn’t answer, Annabeth yelled through the door.

“Donna? Donna!? I’m sorry I followed you, but I know what happened to your friend!”
 
&amp;nbsp;

♦ ♦ Ⓣ ♦ ♦

&amp;nbsp;
 
Annabeth Jones sat on a chair in the centre of the Titans’ base. On either side of her stood Donna and Garth, arms folded, looking as menacing as possible. 

“Don’t worry,” Annabeth spoke. “I’m not gonna tell anyone about this place, or about your secret identities.”

“And how do we know that?” Donna growled, pushing forwards.

“*Because*...” Annabeth winced, struggling to do something she was told never to do. “Because my dad is the Martian Manhunter. ‘J’onn J’onzz’? *’John Jones’*. I’m basically one of you guys.”

“Wait, you’re a Martian?” Garth exclaimed.

“I’m adopted. Does that count?”

Suddenly Garth felt very stupid. But he knew that if J’onn J’onzz trusted this girl enough to keep her under his roof, he could.

“Just tell us what you know,” Donna continued.

Annabeth pulled her phone from her pocket and began fiddling with it. As she searched through apps, she began to explain. “That girl you saw your friend disappear off with? I looked her up. Her name’s Guinevere Long. Goes by ‘Gwen’. She’s new to Gotham U this year, and she’s already been declared the hottest girl on campus.”

“Is she?” Donna asked.

“Well…” Annabeth held out her phone, showing a photo of ‘Gwen’ from her social media. Big blue eyes and long, flowing, red hair, with porcelain white skin that glowed as the sun touched it. 

*Yeah*. Donna could see what they meant. “So you want me to be jealous? I already told you: Wally and I aren’t…”

“No,” Annabeth interjected. “Not jealous. *Worried.*”

“Why?”

“Because ever since Gwen showed up at Gotham U, all the boys are going cuckoo. Even the gay guys. They’re all following her around and raving about her on social media.”

Donna didn’t bother to ask what social media was. Instead, she reached instantly for the analog telephone, pride of place on the nearest countertop. The ‘emergency-only’ *T-Phone*. From what Donna knew about ‘Ancient’ Greek legend, this sounded like the enchanting curse of a siren, luring in witless men for its own selfish and malevolent desires. For this, they needed all hands on deck. 

The phone rang for some time before Dick finally picked up. He spoke with an urgent tone. “What’s up?”

“Nightwing, this is Fury. Kid Flash has been taken by a siren known as ‘Guinevere Long’.” 

“As in ‘Gwen’?” Dick coughed back. “I already heard about her reputation around campus. And I think I might know where to find her.”
  
&amp;nbsp;

♦ ♦ Ⓣ ♦ ♦

&amp;nbsp;
 
Classes were done for the night at Gotham University, but still ongoing were the various extracurriculars and clubs. Dick Grayson, draped head-to-toe in Nightwing blue-and-gold, had already called up his best friend Mal and told him to skip out on Dungeons &amp; Dragons Society for the night, and that he would explain later. Thankfully, Mal agreed without much resistance.

Together, Nightwing, Aqualad and Fury traversed the halls, not caring for any attention they garnered, until they found their way to the entrance to the D&amp;D club’s designated rec room. In proper atmospheric fashion, this was in the basement.

The trio stood at the top of the stairs before entering, with no idea what they were getting themselves in for. Donna gripped her sword tightly, ready to go all out. 

“You sure you’re gonna need that?” asked Dick. “Even if she has some sort of spell, she’s just a girl.”

“If she is a siren then she is dangerous,” Donna explained. “Her razor sharp claws will tear out your throat before you can blink.”

Suddenly, Dick was clutching at his neck nervously. “Understood…”

So the Titans ventured down into the basement, where all the lights were out, leaving them in darkness. But this wasn’t a problem for Garth. No, his peculiar purple eyes were more than suited for vision in the darkest depths. He led the way.

“Here?” Garth whispered, coming to a doorway covered by a draping, leather cloth. 

Dick nodded. “This where the D&amp;D society hold their games.”

“Right,” Donna grisled, before pushing past both of the men and charging in. 

The doorway opened out to a large and spacious room, with walls painted to look like dull brick. Intricate medieval banners as well as swords and shields hung from each wall, with the room only lit by flaming torches. But it wasn’t the walls that concerned the Amazonian hero.

No, that would be the bodies of numerous young men spread across the floor. Boys of ages sixteen to twenty-one, in several states of undress, lying witlessly on the ground, their faces in states of euphoria, their eyes lifeless. They had been discarded. Used. 

Donna looked immediately to the far side of the room, where the bodies of the discarded young men led to a tall throne. Atop it sat the girl, Gwen Long, her tongue buried in Wally West’s throat, all of her attention on her latest pull. Sat in her lap, Wally caressed the immaculate beauty’s cherry red hair, groaning in intense pleasure. But was he really even aware of what was happening?

As Dick and Garth joined Donna’s side in the lustful dungeon, they were equally as disgusted as she was, looking upon her previous conquests. None of whom they could say they recognised. But as they looked upon Gwen, and her radiant body, that all changed.

“Stop!” Donna cried, commanding the seductress’ attention. And she did. Gwen stopped, and she dropped Wally flat onto the floor, where he came to rest without reaction.

Gwen Long turned her head and looked Donna Troy dead in the eye. “I’ve seen you about,” she said in a high-pitched voice and a wide, full-lipped smile. “You were always so pretty. So popular with the boys here, even if you didn’t pay attention.”

“I’m sorry?” Donna scoffed. *What was she talking about?*

“But I’m here to change that. Now they only have eyes for me.”

Slowly, each and every one of the young men on the floor sat up slightly, turning their gazes to Gwen, where they continued to stare longingly.

Donna turned to look to her teammates. Dick and Garth stared down the seductress with just as much intensity as her. They were *together*. “We’re here to stop you.”

“It was only fair,” Gwen gestured to the numerous males about the room. “It was my turn to catch up to all the sluts and skanks of this school. Boys always give them attention. Cos they’re *pretty*. They even complain that they get *too much attention*. When *I*…”

“You can’t do this to people,” Donna gritted her teeth in disgust. “You can’t force them to—”

“I finally have everything I need to make people pay attention to me!” Gwen cried, an ugly growl beneath her perfect visage. “To make *boys* pay attention to me.”

“You’re the ‘hottest girl in the school’,” Donna replied, dumbfounded. “You couldn’t have had much trouble.”

Gwen stood slowly, her harem of boys pawing at her feet as she did. Her composure restored, she spoke calmly. “I wasn’t always. I am this way because of self sacrifice. I *deserve* this.”

“*No-one* deserves this!” Donna gripped her sword. 

“What are you going to do?” Gwen asked coldly. “*Kill me?* I don’t think you’d be nearly as popular with the boys if you did.”

Then, as if on command, the used bodies of the young men twisted and contorted, turning their attention to Donna. Except this time, their look was not one of lust. It was of blind, protective rage. Even Wally climbed to his feet, ready to attack.

Donna looked around her, finding the eyes of two dozen boys watching her, until - to her horror - she found even Nightwing and Aqualad under the seductress’ spell.

*Clang*.

Donna beat Wally aside with her shield as he zoomed towards her. He went flying, knocking down five lurching bodies like bowling pins as they moved to attack. Garth threw a punch, which Donna ducked with ease, not before taking a stern baton to the side. 

Nightwing’s escrima stick sparked and surged, burning electricity through Donna’s armour. She screamed in pain, clamping her jaw down reflexively. She kicked him away with her silver boot, confident the armouring in the centre of his chest would hold as she launched Nightwing into a wall.

But then, while she avoided the rush of a handful of unarmed kids, all quite literally throwing themselves at her fruitlessly, Donna braced herself at the last moment. Aqualad was preparing an attack, and it was more than a punch.

Garth’s eyes roared a violent violet, much brighter than Donna had ever seen before. His hands conjured an aura of the same violet, and then, in a flash, a sharp volley of water rocketed her way. Donna threw up her shield, but the magical wave only crashed up and over, sprayed about the room. She cried as what felt like a dozen razor sharp knives cut across her arms and face, drawing blood, the water having coalesced to form searing, purple-glowing knives. 

And as Donna pulled down her shield, she saw that many of the other young men under the siren’s control had felt the brunt of Aqualad’s attack. None of them were critically injured, but a half dozen bloodied.

But while Donna was caught in yet another moment of horror, and how awful Garth would feel once he snapped out of it, Kid Flash made his return. At superspeed, Wally streaked towards her, prop sword in hand. And though the toy sword was mostly blunt, the young hero’s speed was more than enough to leave Donna with some damage. Donna grabbed at her bloody side as Wally staggered to a halt, but quickly hollered him with the other hand pulling him close.

“You won’t hurt her!” Wally cried desperately, his eyes tearing up as he truly seemed to speak from the heart.

Donna looked upon him with soft but persistent eyes. “She is doing this to you. You don’t care about her.”

“I love her!” Wally growled, kicking and screaming but unable to break free from Donna’s powerful grip. 

Donna let go of her bloody abdomen and resummoned her sword. She held it up, pointing it across the room to the form of Guinevere Long, who still stood staunchly by her mock throne, just watching the events play out. She looked to Wally, keeping her sword pointed and ready. “She’s making you feel like this. She is using you.”

“Maybe I like being used!” Wally roared, almost foaming from the mouth. *No*. This wasn’t Wally. This wasn’t him at all.

“I’m sorry,” Donna replied, lost for words, before headbutting Wally and knocking him to the ground, unconscious.

“They won’t stay down for long,” a voice taunted her.

Donna turned her attention, narrowing down to one singular target. The seductress that taunted her. Guinevere Long. The Amazon warrior glared at her with focused and unbridled fury, not unlike her namesake. She spoke three words with simple and absolute authority, slowly stepping towards the witch, sword in hand. “What. Are. You?”

Gwen blinked, something changing in her. She kept up the appearance of a vindictive bitch, but this was something more. Fear? Maybe just knowing the giantess before her meant business. “I… I’m just a normal girl.”

“Normal girls don’t have this power over men,” Donna stated, unfaltering, “Nor this sick ambition. So what is it? Siren? Succubus? I’ve lived plenty of folklore, and read what I haven’t, you monster.”

“I made a deal,” Gwen explained, backing up now as Donna grew closer. “And this was my end of it. Any boy I wanted. As many boys as I wanted.”

“On whose authority!?” Donna cried, outraged and disgusted, as she threw her sword forward.

Gwen squealed as Donna’s wrath crashed down towards her. “On the Ch—”

But she was interrupted.

“Stop!” A hand reached out of nowhere and grabbed Donna by the wrist, pulling her back. Donna bolted around, ready to lash out at anyone who stayed the execution of such a terrorous monster. But there, she found nineteen-year-old Annabeth Jones, desperately out of breath. “Show mercy, Donna. Please.”

Donna took a deep breath. “She manipulated, and controlled, and used *all* of these men.”

“She’s sick,” Annabeth replied, pleading to her. “Powerful, yes, but sick.”

“I—!” Donna snapped, before she caught herself.

Beat.

“I…”

She dropped her sword to the ground.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
 
“I can’t believe it…” Donna spoke, crestfallen, but surrounded by friends back at Knock-Out Video. “I almost killed that girl.”

Wally took a sip of water. “I almost had sex with that girl…”

Donna couldn’t help but remember what Wally had cried to her, under that spell, as she pulled him up by the scruff of his neck. “And you wouldn’t have wanted that?”

“Hell, no!” Wally exclaimed, almost offended she had to ask. “Sure she was… nice looking. But it would have been meaningless. And… I don’t think I’m… ready. I’m sorry I told you different back there.”

“You couldn’t control what you were saying,” Dick piped up, stood with his arms crossed.

“Or what we did, right?” Garth approached uneasily. “My powers… I hurt all those boys. I didn’t even realise I was capable of something that destructive…”

“You aren’t,” Dick interjected immediately, sure as ever. He placed a hand on Garth’s shoulder. “I’ve known you long enough to know you don’t have the capacity to hurt people like that. Not when its you behind the wheel.”

“I just…” Garth didn’t know what to say.

“I suppose that makes Fury officially Titan Number One!” Wally interrupted, easing the tension. Dick, Donna and Garth all turned their heads. “Well, Don, you handed our asses to us all, and then some.”

Donna chuckled humbly, but then looked up with a sly grin. “I didn’t realise this was disputed!”

The Titans all laughed, happy this nightmare was over, and eager to move forward.

But then Wally cut in once more, a thought spreading across his dumb face. “Garth, you finished watching Lord of the Rings like I suggested, right?”

“Actually, I’m only part way through film two, but I reckon I’ll probably be done by sunrise,” Garth replied quietly.

“Don’t waste your time,” Wally grinned, “The books are much better!”

&amp;nbsp;
 
Elsewhere, Gwen Long sat alone in a cold holding cell. But this was no prison, not of the traditional sense at least. She had been split off into her own personal wing of STAR Labs, one staffed only by women. Researchers she had no influence over. But night had fallen, and the STAR Labs personnel had gone home to their families, leaving her in darkness.

The long-legged beauty rose from the bed and shambled over to the cell door. She stared into the reflective glass, gazing upon her reflection: the image of a perfect woman. But that all melted away with a gust of smoke, revealing to her the long-dreaded visage of her true self. Of Jennifer Minse. 

She had been transformed. Back to her old ways. Her eyes lingered on each imperfection. She loathed her patchy skin, her slouchy posture, her wide nose, and her fat, terrible, grotesque form. 

*She was back.* Jennifer Minse was back. The girl everyone turned their noses up at, whom no-one appreciates. The girl nobody wanted. She only ever wanted to be wanted. 

But she had failed. The deal was for nothing.

“But…”

“...ɴᴏ ᴇxᴄᴜsᴇs…” an ethereal, bassy voice rumbled, shaking the walls of Jennifer’s cell. “...ꜰᴀɪʟᴜʀᴇ ᴄᴀɴɴᴏᴛ ʙᴇ ᴛᴏʟᴇʀᴀᴛᴇᴅ...”

But Jennifer wasn’t surprised by the sound of the demonic voice. She was shaken the core with fear, but it was no surprise. She had been hearing it ever since the deal, in whispers from crowds, or sometimes in the wind. But never so directly.

“I can’t go back!” Jennifer pleaded, dropping to her knees and beginning to pray. “Please! I can’t go back to being this pathetic little girl.”

Silence.

“...ᴏʜ...” the voice continued, its tone upturned. “...ᴅᴏ ɴᴏᴛ ꜰᴇᴀʀ. ʏᴏᴜ'ʀᴇ ɴᴏ ɢᴏᴏᴅ ᴛᴏ ᴜs ɪɴ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴜsᴇʟᴇss ꜰᴏʀᴍ...”

“Thank you!” Jennifer cried, her hands clasped together as she praised the sky.

“...ᴡᴇ ʜᴀᴠᴇ sᴏᴍᴇᴛʜɪɴɢ ʙᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ɪɴ ᴍɪɴᴅ ꜰᴏʀ ʏᴏᴜ…”

And with that, Jennifer quickly began to wish she could repeal her praise. The rumbling around her only intensified as the cage around her began to tremor and spark. She felt the gravity around her intensify, dragging her closer to the ground. Then, her arms were thrown apart as a bloodcurdling crack sounded. It was only a moment later that the appropriate pain set in, and with it, the terror of her impending fate.

Jennifer Minse’s bones began to shift and change, Her fat and flesh was ground away, leaving only bare, red muscle. She screamed in torturous agony as her bones set into new positions, finding new sockets. Then she pawed helplessly at what was left of her face, with what was left of her hands, broken and reshaped to form wretched claws. But she was helpless to watch in the mirror as all of her features melted away, and with them, the last of her humanity. Leaving a truly grotesque and gruesome creature afterall.

So here's my situation. I've been working at a grocery store (that's unionized) since I was 18 years old and I'm 25 today. I'm under an old contract that has zero deductions from my paycheck for  health and dental and vision insurance. I make *okay* pay (about 1100$ extra a month after all my bills paid WITH A ROOMMATE)  and most importantly I get time off whenever I want because obviously grocery stores have alot of employees. 

Seriously I'm currently writing this from Florida visiting my family, and all I had to do was simply request off in a booklet without using any vacation days or fighting for a day off. Also my hours are amazing, get done work at either 2pm or 3:30 pm and can go to stores that are still open. 


The one thing I'm worried about with a new job is working mon - fri with like 10 vacation days(just an example) a year and watching life fly by because ""lol oops not enough vacation days"". I really don't want to be 50 with a fat bank account and have done nothing in life.


What's my degree in? Computer science, I had an okay GPA and it's been hard finding a job (might be my area?) probably because I never did any internship or anything.  On the plus side, computer science jobs would have much more pay and way better raises then a grocery store. So a comp sci job would be way more money in the future due to better raises.

Tldr: computer science would be better long term money potentional/easier retirement, but grocery store job let's me enjoy my youth and go out and do whatever "

I live in NC, but am really hoping to find an internship in the Austin Texas area, maybe San Marcos, even New Braunfels. But I have no connections in the RT field in Texas. I was wondering if any of y'all know of any psychiatric facilities or drug/alcohol rehab facilities in the area that are a good place to work, and if you know they do internships even better. Please help. I moved to western Carolina for school and because they had one of the top  programs. But the only places my school has contracts with are in the Raleigh area, south Carolina, or Virginia for behavioral health or rehab. Personally I have been moving every two years for the past 6 years and would really like to move to a place where I have friends because it takes me about a year to find friends I've realized (I used to live in the Houston area and have friends in San Marcos and Austin) and I know it will be hard to find a job after an internship so I'd like to get a job where I have an internship and because I really don't want to live in a new freaking place again where I go through depression for a year until I find my niche. So please if you have any leads on psychiatric facilities or drug/alcohol rehab facilities with CTRSs please let me know. I'm desperate and have to find a internship by December

It's likely that I rarely go through your mind at all anymore.  

We were never that close. You would joke about how you could come off as ""icy"" to people, but for some reason, I never felt put off by you.  

We hung out a few times in groups, and I wish I felt then what I feel for you now. I know in the past you felt something for me, but I was not very responsive to it then. I never meant to be mean to you. The time we knew each other was a troubling time for me. My mental health was in a consistently downward spiral. I'm sorry if I ever hurt you in any way.  

  

A few months ago, I finally received treatment for my years of depression after my third suicide attempt. For the first time in as long as I can remember, I feel whole. That summer, back from my first year of college, was the best few months of my life. You weren't in town then, off on an internship.  

I met up with your brother once when out with a few friends, went back to your house for a bit to hang out. I remember talking with your parents, them asking me how I was doing and seeing a picture of you on the wall. I don't know why but I haven't been able to get you out of my mind since then.  

If I had an excuse to contact you, I would use it. I just want you to know that I'm sorry for everything in the past. I feel like a new person now. I think I may be attracted to you, but now we live hours apart, and a relationship would be unpractical and it would be unfair of me to try to seek one out with you. So much has changed in the last year and a half, I just want to be able to share it with you."
9ojyup,3,2018-10-15,My betta Caligula died. What do I do with the tank?,ahmay,bettafish,https://www.reddit.com/r/bettafish/comments/9ojyup/my_betta_caligula_died_what_do_i_do_with_the_tank/,"Hi friends, my red betta Caligula (Cal) died after a 2-week fight with dropsy. I just finished burying him near some rosemary in the front of the house. He lived with me for 1.5 years after being gifted to me by a co-worker when my first blue betta (Buddy) died when I was away for a summer internship. I've been a fish owner for 3.5 years now and I haven't had to deal with a fish death before... Buddy died while under the care of my co-worker and he introduced Cal into the same tank about a week before I came back home. I think my co-worker just got lucky Cal was hardy enough to handle the tank Buddy lived in because my co-worker was not knowledgeable about cycling or how to properly introduce a new fish into a tank. I think he just plopped Cal in there and hoped for the best.

How do I clean my tank properly before I get a new fish? Are there any treatments or things I need to do to ensure the environment is best for a new fish? Cal was alive when I left at 8am but I found him when I came home around 7pm. I think he may have passed early in the morning as I was already able to see signs of decomposition (white slime) and the water does have a light smell (whereas it usually has no smell). 

I just completed a 50% water change because of the smell of the water. I have live plants (anubis) in the tank and left the heater (thermometer reading at 80 degrees) and filter running. Cal was the only fish in the tank (5.5 gallons). 

Thank you for your help and advice in advance."
9ok18r,22,2018-10-15,[From an Aftab Campaign intern] Sherrod Brown will be visiting Cincy tomorrow to help launch a canvass for Aftab!,AftabIntern,cincinnati,https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/9ok18r/from_an_aftab_campaign_intern_sherrod_brown_will/,"[DISCLAIMER: I'm an intern from the Aftab campaign promoting an event for him with mod approval.] 

 Hey /r/Cincinnati ! I'm an intern from the Aftab campaign and we just got news late this afternoon that Senator Sherrod Brown will be launching a canvass for Aftab. The launch will be at 3:30 and we are looking for volunteers to help canvass afterwards.

Aftab Pureval is the Democratic canidate who is running for the house district (OH-1) against Steve Chabot, and will represent a large portion of Cincinnati and the Cincinnati area if he gets elected.

If you're a supporter of Aftab, it's very important that you help if you can. We're getting very close to the election, and canvassing has been shown to be very effective in getting supporters for a candidate. Aftab and Chabot are neck and neck, so any amount of help is super helpful! 

The launch should start at 3:30 PM tomorrow (12/16) , and canvassing itself should take around 2 hours. It is recommended that you canvass with someone if you can, but canvassing alone is also possible. Transportation to and from the canvassing destination is also recommend, but something can be figured out if transport is an issue.

I'll send the address to anyone interested. If you are, send me a PM and I'll just have to confirm a bit of information with you. Im heading to bed now, but I'll be here early tomorrow morning. I hope a few of you can make it! Thanks!

**#WhereIsJamal, Pt. 2**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Saudi government is [reportedly prepared to admit](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/middleeast/saudi-khashoggi-death-turkey/index.html?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) that *Washington Post* columnist Jamal Khashoggi**—the Saudi citizen and U.S. resident who disappeared into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week and never emerged—died in its custody under interrogation as part of a botched effort to abduct him and return him to Saudi Arabia. In other words, Saudi officials murdered Khashoggi, as has been widely suspected for days.          
               
**Unfortunately, it’s unclear whether Trump will accept the confession, or impose any punishment on the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,** or the individuals responsible for Khashoggi’s murder, because he has a corrupt relationship with the Saudi government.           
               
**[Speaking to reporters at the White House](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/politics/trump-saudi-king-tweet/index.html?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) on Monday morning, Trump touted the “very strong” denial he received from Saudi King Salman,** and posited that “rogue killers” might have murdered Khashoggi.          
               
**The question is why, and whether his reluctance to accept the truth of the matter is going to create a global crisis.**          
               
**Trump has claimed he would [impose punishment](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/13/middleeast/khashoggi-saudi-turkey-investigation-intl/index.html?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) on Saudi Arabia, short of canceling U.S. arm sales to the kingdom,** if it turns out the Saudis did in fact kill Khashoggi. But it’s entirely possible that Trump, who has boasted about Saudi investment in his personal business, has even more corrupt motives for letting the Saudi government get away with murdering a U.S.-based journalist.          
               
**Trump’s involvement in this charade is reminiscent of his ongoing participation in the Russian government coverup of the crimes it committed during the 2016 election.** He is siding with the Saudi government over the growing consensus of his own government, just as he [publicly accepts Vladimir Putin’s denial](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/16/vladimir-putin-denies-meddling-2016-presidential-election/788219002/?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) that Russia interfered in the 2016 election—despite knowing full well that Russia interfered, and that his [campaign happily accepted the help](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/11/17438386/trump-russia-collusion?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). He is acting equally compromised now, with equally disastrous consequences.          
               
**According to CNN, the Saudis will issue a report that says [Khashoggi’s death “was the result of an interrogation that went wrong](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/middleeast/saudi-khashoggi-death-turkey/index.html?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive),** one that was intended to lead to his abduction from Turkey,” and that it may “conclude that the operation was carried out without clearance and transparency and that those involved will be held responsible.”          
               
**If this reporting is correct, Trump may decide to let the Saudi’s off the hook anyhow,** creating a horrifying precedent that will endanger exiled dissidents all over the world.

**[Sen. Elizabeth Warren](https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/1051783184390664192) (D-MA) issued the results of a DNA test that confirms her Native American ancestry—a response to years of Republican taunting, including by President Trump, who routinely refers to her as “Pocahontas.”** At a July rally, [Trump offered $1 million](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/politics/donald-trump-elizabeth-warren-dna-1-million/index.html?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) to a charity of Warren’s choice if she took a DNA test confirming she was “an Indian”—he now says he will only make the donation if he [can administer the test himself](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1051943541721759744).

From Brian: Trump is disgusting, but this particular racist smear began with “normal” Republicans, who have been questioning Warren’s ancestry for years. There has never been any reason to believe that she invented her heritage, and the test merely shows that the Warren family lore she learned when she was young was rooted in fact.

9okhsy,0,2018-10-16,2 days of texting culminated in a mutual no contact order [NEED ADVICE],midfieldpivot,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9okhsy/2_days_of_texting_culminated_in_a_mutual_no/,"EDIT 1: Thanks everyone for the help! The picture is becoming clearer now. I know what I did wrong (i.e. pretty much everything lol).

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 weeks ago, I asked out a coworker. We work for a college transport service that offers students safe rides around the city the campus is based in. Here's some context:

&amp;#x200B;

We met at staff training. I'm sure that she was interested in me first. There were several signs, but the clearest was when she returned from one of the small breaks during training, and I turned my head to see who was approaching. (We were sitting next to each other in a classroom). She averted her eyes downward, smiled slightly, and blushed. I quickly looked away. I'm not very experienced with flirting or love (due to my upbringing). She took it as a sign of shyness. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw that she turned to face me, brushed her hair, and what intuitively felt like a smile. It lasted for a while. I just froze. I didn't know what to do, but looked straight ahead and didn't look back at her. She got a little embarrassed, and moved to another seat directly behind me. I regretted that.

3 days after training, we had our first shift. And behold, we were randomly scheduled to have the first two shifts together. Looking back, the shifts felt like we hit it off well. She laughed at my jokes, and she came across as refreshingly honest, and had some very funny sass equipped when a group of freshman riders acted a little immaturely. I really liked her honesty and humor.

The first night ended a little awkwardly, because it was clear that she liked me but I didn't know what to do. I carry with me shame and the need for validation from my upbringing, so I couldn't risk doing anything that would set me up for rejection, even if the attraction was ""in your face"" obvious.

The second night went even better than the first, I recall, and at the end I asked her out. She said ""sure!"" with enthusiasm, and we exchanged numbers because I promised I would give her a good time to meet once I looked at my schedule. When we got out of the service van, there were coworkers nearby and I wanted to keep it professional and not give anything away, since nothing really happened yet and I didn't want gossip. There were 2 coworkers in front of us walking back to the office, and I simply walked ahead of them because I'm a fast walker. I inadvertently left her behind as well. I don't know what happened, but suddenly she got distant. I remember slowing down my pace to allow to her to catch up, but she never did. It was quite strange. Something must have changed her mind.

The next morning, I texted her and asked if she wanted to go for a drink two days away. This part still leaves me confused, so I think it's best if I quoted the conversation here:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hey \[girl's name\]. It's \[my name\].

Are you free on Friday to go out for a drink?

Her: I'm super busy during the day on Friday and then I have work.  Sorry

Me: That's ok. What about the weekend?

Her: Honestly, I'm super busy for the next couple of weeks with school and work and internship stuff

Me: It's all good.

Her: I'm sorry.  I'm just a lot more busy then I thought I was

Me: No, it's honestly completely fine. You do what you have to do. I'm looking at 18 credits this term plus work, so maybe I haven't realized how much of a death sentence it will be for me yet. \[laughing emoji\]

&amp;#x200B;

By the last text, I was completely confused about how that panned out. Can a person change their mind that quickly? What could I have done to lose her interest? These thoughts went in circles in my mind until the evening; at this point, because I was a little angry about being what I felt was being flaked on, especially since I was the one to reciprocate. I felt like I needed a straight answer, because I didn't really believe her ""busyness"". So this happened at around 10:30 PM:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Would you still be keen on getting a drink after a couple of weeks? Just give it to me straight here.

Her: I just got out of a two year relationship with a former coworker and it ended really horribly on my end of it.  I can't date a coworker again and I'm not ready to date anyone yet

Me: I'm sorry to hear that. Well I hope that'll change. This needs no saying, but I assure you that what you said does not change my attitude toward you as a coworker. Take care.

Her: I appreciate your understanding

Me: It needs no mentioning :)

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, in retrospect I had made a mistake. By asking her to give it to me straight, I compromised some trust between us, especially because I know her to be honest. It does feel like that the relationship thing was actually an excuse this time.

I didn't let go very easily. I still kept my feelings, and from our interactions after it was evident she still cared about me, but we were getting into the friend zone. I could've left things as they were, but I had let myself get into the attachment phase.

Two weeks later, she happened to be a rider in my van at a football game night. It was needless to say awkward in the van, mostly from my part I think. I haven't mentally worked through the story from this point on, so at this point you may read some incoherent lines of thinking. On the way to her drop off, my navigator that night suggested we turn onto this narrow street to ""avoid traffic"". Turned out, it was busy and there was so little room for my van to avoid the incoming traffic and two columns of parked cars on both sides. I ended up dinging side mirrors with another parked car. I was so embarrassed. There wasn't a scratch on either vehicle, but I remember the rest of the drive feeling like the biggest idiot in the world, and probably her opinion of me was the lowest. This of course wasn't true at all. I remember dropping her off, and she turned and gave us a prolonged wave, while looking straight at me. My mind was still reeling from embarrassment, so I gave her a curt wave back and a smile. Friendly stuff, of course, but remember what I said about shame and need for validation? I compromised myself after.

Leaving the office that night, I did something after that was clearly manipulative. I wanted to see how she felt after the little accident. So I texted:

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, I hope folks got back mentally alright from the incident. I should've foreseen it was narrow and busy street and not taken it. Minus that and the game, hope your night was good!""

&amp;#x200B;

(In case you're curious, our football team lost the game.)

And no response, for 2 hours. I got frustrated. I felt like I deserved a ""straight answer"" (because for some twisted reason, I felt she was leading me on). I exploded with a long ""how I feel"" text:

&amp;#x200B;

""Look, I'm going to be 100% honest. Maybe it's late, so that's why you haven't responded, but I like you, and the last two weeks have been truly hell for me. My every day's waking thoughts revolve around this ""will she, won't she"" mechanism that I can't get out of. My gut tells me that you essentially rejected me, but my head tells me that ""maybe, it's true that she just wants some personal time"". I really do need a straight answer. A ""no"" will disappoint me, but it will not give me hell. Guys really do prefer a straight answer, so we can cut ourselves free to other pursuits. Sounds shallow, perhaps, but it's not like we're dating. Rejecting me now will affect me for a few days, but it would not lead me on. Perhaps you're busy, but if I were that good a prospect, then you would make plans. It's really implausible that a person cannot make plans for something exciting. I have much sympathy for people who've been hurt, so telling me that you were hurt from a previous relationship would simply make me feel more protective, as hard as I try to fight my gut feeling. I believe I've given you the proper respect to indicate that I take your words at face value, but it's becoming quite insane. Attraction, if there, would feel different. It would be more involved, it would feel more empowering. That's why if you aren't interested in anything more than being coworkers, then simply say so. Soften the blow or not, what's important is a straight ""yes"" or ""no"". If you want to play games, then make them evident, or not play them at all. You may think by being completely transparent like this means I don't think you're worth the pursuit, but at this point, it's cruel to not reciprocate. If you truly respect me as a human being, no more than that, then be honest with me for once. I cannot give other girls my time of day if you're in the back of my head. I have thought about seeking interest in other girls the past two weeks, but I wanted to give you time, because I believed you. It sounds like a prideful statement, but again, we're nothing more than coworkers at this point. If you want my interest, then make it easy to figure out, if you prefer to keep some element of mystery. Or cut me loose. Don't keep it vague because you don't want to hurt my feelings, because keeping me in the grey is 10x the torture. Don't keep it vague because you want me to work harder. Give me better hints, not what you said about being busy or not ready, because those give me hope. By being 100% honest here, I'm showing my respect to you and myself. I really do like you, so honest with me once. You know the old trope, that guys will improve themselves to the girls they like. I'm ready to do that, because since we don't meet very often, I can't chase after someone who's not available. I keep my word as before, I will be professional at work no matter what you say. Let me know straight so I know to fully treat you as more than or just a coworker.""

""So answer me straight: would you like to get to know each other better?""

&amp;#x200B;

This was clearly a jerk move, let alone cringy, and was clearly harassment. But I was confused about what we had, and subconsciously I wanted her to reject me completely so I would have my shame validated.

I felt terrible the day after, but my ego convinced me that she would either be smitten (I know, WTF) or do me a coup-de-grace. What I got shocked to my core. It actually woke me up to how controlling I had been through this whole thing. Here was her text:

""I have already told you no.  This is completely inappropriate and unacceptable.  You're literally harassing me""

At this point I was shaken out of it. What had I done? Was I such a monster? I responded:

""I'm very sorry. I did not realize you said no. This is lesson learned for me. Again, truly sorry and I'll just forget every bad thing that's happened here.""

She didn't respond. I felt like she could no longer take me at my words, that no matter what I texted, she wouldn't believe me. So I thought about meeting her in person and sincerely apologizing for my behavior. I wanted to make it clear that I didn't want any agenda doing this, that I would be apologizing as a human being. So I texted:

""Hi \[girl's name\], I'd like to apologize to you in person at some point this week, if you'll allow it. It will only take 1 minute. Please know that this is not another one of my personal agendas to get you to do anything, other than to understand. This comes from a place where I care about my workplace and the well-being of my coworkers. If I could explain myself in person, it would clear things up and greatly ease my conscience. I know I've written many words here, and they mean so little right now. That's partly why I want to meet. I don't ask you to forgive me yet, but I do want you to at least see that I'm trying to undo my mistake so our future interactions would be alright. If you agree, please let me know a good time and place.""

In hindsight, I should've waited and processed this, because the text, while well intended, read like I wanted to do exactly what I said I wouldn't do.

We are near the end. 2 days later, I was informed by the university that a mutual no contact directive has been set in place between me and her. It really broke me. I hadn't even received a ""don't talk to me anymore"" from anyone before this, but to be served with something that's typically a result of sexual aggression was too much.

I acted out of shame and need for validation, and it cost me dearly.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I want to know: did I do something so monstrous to be handed a no contact order? I would appreciate some pointers to help process this. And if you were in her shoes, how would you have felt and acted?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading my story!"

I'm an American college student thinking about interning at an Estonian company this upcoming summer. Your former President Toomas Ilves\* is a visiting fellow at my university, so that's how I've come to hear about the tech/startup scene in Estonia (I have also visited Tallinn). I'm thinking of trying to find a computer-related internship (mainly data science/analytics, for \~3 months) in Estonia and would like some advice (still not sure if it's a crazy idea).

\- I'm thinking of targeting startups (Taxify, TransferWise, etc), since they tend to be more flexible. I'm from Silicon Valley and the etiquette here is to basically email someone at the startup with my CV attached (usually can find their contact on angellist) if I'm interested in joining. Not sure if cold emailing is accepted in Estonia, or if there is some email etiquette I should follow to be more effective?

\- I don't expect to be paid by the startup, but I know labor protection laws are stronger in Europe generally, so I'm wondering if unpaid internships are a common thing?

\- Other than angellist, is there any other local websites I could take a look at? I'm looking more for a company database with contact info rather than a job board, because of my my nontraditional situation

The Kochs [historical background](https://www.reddit.com/r/KochWatch/comments/85xtfv/the_kochs_reason_magazine_robert_lefevre_and_the/?st=jmaeoyso&amp;sh=95a891c5) with [extreme elements](http://www.unkochmycampus.org/los-preface/) - they and their fathers history with the John Birch Society and Robert LaFevre and Murray Rothbard who went of to found the von Mises Institute - is already documented and Nancy MacLeans book examines their association with [James McGill Buchanan](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/meet-the-economist-behind-the-one-percents-stealth-takeover-of-America).

But their contempory interactions and funding aren't as well understood or clearly documented. 

What they point to is the Kochs being a major influence on promoting extremists and the pipeline from libertarianism to anarcho capitalism to the altright.

[Charles Murray, author of the infamous Bell Curve, is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute – one of the key Koch funded think tanks and David sits on the board of directors.](https://www.aei.org/scholar/charles-murray/)

Garret Jones, an economist at George Mason University (the largest recipiant of Koch funding on college campuses with 95 million between 2005-2015 and earlier this year it was discovered they have in fact obtained control over the hiring and firing of faculty) [whose recent monograph was positively reviewed by VDARE in July 2017. Jones draws heavily on the work of white supremacist and eugenicist Richard Lynn, and even personally thanked the Pioneer Fund figurehead in an article he published in the Journal of Economic Growth in 2005. In 2015 Jones delivered a lecture which argued that less democracy in the United States would lead to better governance.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/stefan-molyneux)

(You have to scroll down a bit to the timeline of interviews)

[Florida Atlantic University professor Marshall DeRosa is a member of the League of the South and employed by the Kochs for their 'prisoner outreach'.](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-charles-koch-is-helping-neo-confederates-teach-college-students/)

[Assistant Professor Jonathan Anomaly at the Department of Political Economy and Moral Science at the University of Arizona, which has received 1.8 million from the Kochs and 2.6 million from their associates, published an article Public Goods and Education. In it Anomaly discussed the value of exploring links between genetics and IQ of different racial groups, and the value of eugenics. And elsewhere opposes public education, something the Kochs have long promoted.](https://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2018/01/02/libertarians-on-public-government-schools-from-milton-friedman-to-the-koch-brothers-to-ua-and-asu-an-incomplete-history)

These three come just from stories found on /r/KochWatch, considering how much money they spend on colleges, endowments they have provided, schools they have set up on campuses how many more are there?

Through [Donors Capital Fund](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Donors_Capital_Fund) the Kochs fund Daniel Pipes Islamophobic Middle East Forum.

[The Kochs, along with the Mercers and DeVos, fund another think tank Young America's Foundation that funded those lecture tours that caused so much commotion featuring Murray, David Horowitz, Ann Coulter, Ted Nugent, Milo Yiannopoulos. Its board member James B. Taylor is the former president of the National Policy Institute, now run by altright icon Richard Spencer.](https://www.alternet.org/right-wing/rightwing-billionaires-are-intentionally-funding-hate-speech-college-campuses) Other speakers it has sponsored have included [Robert Spencer](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/robert-spencer), and now [Ben Shapiro](https://www.yaf.org/shapirotour/).

[Dave Rubin](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAYFgmOWAI) now receives funding from [many Koch groups](http://progressivearmy.com/2018/04/06/dave-rubins-sudden-political-change-receiving-money-koch-brothers/)

Charlie Kirks TPUSA [is also Koch linked](https://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/who-funds-conservative-campus-group-turning-point-usa-donors-revealed-2620325).

In Canada, Rebel Media was founded by Ezra Levant – [formerly he worked at the Koch funded Fraser Institute and did his internship at the Charles G. Koch Foundation]( https://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/2012/04/25/charitable-fraser-institute-accepted-500k-foreign-funding-oil-billionaires?page=0,1). It has received [funding](https://pressprogress.ca/exclusive_rebel_media_ezra_levant_received_foreign_funding_from_anti_muslim_think_tank/) from the Middle East Forum, which the Kochs fund. And has [produced](https://pressprogress.ca/rebel-media-produced-anti-muslim-propaganda-with-foreign-group-funded-by-trumps-top-donor/) anti-Muslim attack ads with them featuring far-right personalities.

Rebel Media has been a regular platform for Jordan Peterson [who they have raised money for](https://thevarsity.ca/2017/05/01/jordan-petersons-federal-funding-denied-rebel-media-picks-up-the-tab/), Lauren Southern, Gavin McInnes, and Faith Goldy - who favourably cite Richard Spencer.

Jordan Peterson also often recommends [Koch linked groups](https://mobile.twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/968633924724256768), pals around with Dave Rubin, [and appears at TPUSA events with Kirk, Shapiro, and other Koch linked speakers](https://www.reddit.com/r/KochWatch/comments/9oigpu/charlie_kirk_and_tpusa_koch_funded_host_jordan/?st=jnb3u6u5&amp;sh=9e9a5295).

Yet another think tank employing many Koch alumni is [Speech First](https://www.thenation.com/article/dark-money-behind-campus-speech-wars/), it promotes the mantra of 'liberals' silencing dissent on campuses. The same cultural war ideology promoted by many of the people and groups listed here.

And for additional evidence, the high school carriculum they donate when schools run short of funding ([because of Koch backed efforts](https://qz.com/1245033/this-koch-brothers-backed-law-stops-states-from-raising-teacher-salaries/) to cut taxes that fund them): [1](https://www.theroot.com/millions-of-students-are-quietly-being-taught-the-koch-1823742091), [2](https://www.alternet.org/human-rights/what-koch-brothers-want-students-learn-about-slavery).

As the Garret Jones link demonstrates Stefan Molyneux maintains connections to Jones, the von Mises Institute founded by their former associate Rothbard, Murray who is Koch funded, the League of the South which DeRosa is associated with, and others in the emerging altright, which are all Koch linked either through direct funding or associating with those they fund.

The conventional economists and think tanks they support are combined with the academics that provide an 'intellectual' underpinning to ""racial realism"" and the groups pushing the mantra of 'liberal' take over of college campuses and society by the likes of Rubin, Peterson, Kirk, Molyneux and outlets like Rebel Media to motivate disaffected young men and provide simple emotionally appealing explanations for what the cause of their problems are, all the while directing them to support campaigns and politicians the Kochs back.

What this should all point to is that the Kochs are not merely classical liberals or libertarians concerned with government overreach, but rather while we have no direct quotes we can nevertheless surmise from their repeated pattern of associations and funding that the Kochs seek to create a 'let the chips fall where they may' institutionally-biased racism concealed within economic jargon.

And it should also point to a confluence of these academics and media personalities pushing a demographic to an increasingly extreme position that welcomes conflict.

As one of their pet academics once said:

&gt;In support of building their own youth movement, another speaker, the libertarian historian Leonard Liggio, cited the success of the Nazi model. In his paper titled ""National Socialist Political Strategy: Social Change in a Modern Industrial Society with an Authoritarian Tradition,"" Liggio, who was affiliated with the Koch-funded Institute for Humane Studies (IHS) from 1974 to 1998, described the Nazis' successful creation of a youth movement a key to their capture of the state. Like the Nazis, he suggested, libertarians should organise university students to create group identity.

&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1          
Heeft u kennisgenomen van het jaarverslag van ING over 2016, waarin de post ‘loans and advances to customers’ over de jaren 2014 en 2015 met maar liefst 185 en 163 miljard euro door ING naar boven wordt bijgesteld &amp;#40;pagina 111 van het jaarverslag&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. Naar aanleiding van de vragen van de leden Omtzigt en Ronnes heb ik de jaarrekening van ING over 2016 nader bekeken. Daaruit wordt duidelijk dat het verschil in de betreffende post volgt uit liquiditeitsmanagement &amp;#40;‘cash pooling’&amp;#41;. Dit wordt gebruikt door bedrijven met meerdere rekeningen en activiteiten in verschillende landen. Bij het ‘poolen’ van alle rekeningen van één bedrijf kunnen positieve en negatieve standen van een klant worden gesaldeerd. Hieronder treft u een theoretisch voorbeeld van ‘cash pooling’ voor een klant met drie rekeningen. De bruto vordering op klant ‘A’ is 15, terwijl de bruto deposito van klant ‘A’ 20 bedraagt. Indien de standen op een gegeven moment gesaldeerd zouden worden, gaat het &amp;#40;netto&amp;#41; om een vordering van 0 en een deposito van 5.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Tabel 1: Theoretisch voorbeeld  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
-10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gesaldeerd  
&amp;nbsp;    
+5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Mijn begrip van de openbare jaarrekeningen van ING is als volgt. In de jaarrekeningen over de jaren 2014, 2015 en 2016 wordt ‘cash pooling’ op netto basis gepresenteerd. In de jaarrekening over 2016 wordt uitgelegd dat ING in de loop van 2016 haar beleid heeft aangepast waardoor saldering aan het einde van elke verslaggevingsperiode plaatsvindt. Bij de geconsolideerde balans over 2016 zijn daarom de vergelijkende cijfers van de betreffende rekeningen voor de jaren 2014 en 2015 op bruto basis gepresenteerd. Dit leidt in de vergelijking tot hogere vorderingen op klanten die gebruik maken van ‘cash pooling’. Hieronder treft u het verloop aan van de totale vorderingen op klanten &amp;#40;‘loans and advances to customers’&amp;#41; van ING. Hierbij is onderscheid gemaakt tussen cash pooling op netto en – waar beschikbaar - bruto basis &amp;#40;lichtgrijs&amp;#41;. Het verschil komt op dezelfde manier terug in de vergelijking van de totale deposito’s van klanten.  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2            
Kent u een ander voorbeeld uit de geschiedenis van het Nederlandse bedrijfsleven, waarbij een bedrijf zijn balans met 185 miljard euro moet bijstellen? Zo ja, welk bedrijf? Zo nee, wat is de hoogste verandering die u bekend is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
In 2016 hebben meerdere banken cash pooling zowel op netto als bruto basis meegenomen in hun verslaglegging van vorderingen op klanten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3              
Was u &amp;#40;uw ambtsvoorganger&amp;#41; op de hoogte dat ING, die in 2014 staatssteun had, zulke grote bedragen in ‘asset pooling’ niet op de balans had staan, terwijl dat volgens de internationale standaarden wel moest?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
De internationale verslaggevingsstandaarden &amp;#40;IFRS&amp;#41; schrijven niet voor dat ‘cash pooling’ te allen tijde op bruto basis moet worden gepresenteerd. Op basis van de standaarden mag een onderneming in haar geconsolideerde jaarrekening het nettobedrag in de balans opnemen indien de onderneming: “&amp;#40;a&amp;#41; thans een in rechte afdwingbaar recht heeft om de opgenomen bedragen te salderen; en“&amp;#40;b&amp;#41; voornemens is om hetzij de verplichting op netto basis af te wikkelen, ofwel om het actief te realiseren op hetzelfde moment dat de verplichting wordt afgewikkeld.” Bij het opstellen van de jaarrekeningen moeten ondernemingen deze principes toepassen. De principes staan toe dat ondernemingen, zoals ING, dergelijke cijfers in het jaarverslag op netto basis presenteren indien naar de mening van de onderneming en haar accountant aan die principes wordt voldaan.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De minister van Financiën is niet verantwoordelijk voor de inhoud van de jaarlijkse verslaglegging van individuele banken. Daarom is er geen overleg met banken of hun accountants over de toepassing van de internationale verslaggevingsstandaarden in de praktijk. Ook niet met ING en haar accountant. De Staat heeft in 2014 de laatste aflossing van ING ontvangen, ten tijde van het opstellen van de jaarrekening was er geen sprake meer van staatssteun.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De IFRS staan overigens los van de prudentiële kwalificatie, bijvoorbeeld voor de leverage ratio &amp;#40;zie hiervoor het antwoord op onder meer vraag 7 en 10&amp;#41;.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4              
Wat zijn de risico’s van ‘asset pooling’?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Indien bij cash pooling over alle rekeningen van een klant gesaldeerd sprake is van een negatieve stand, heeft de bank een vordering op de klant. Er is dan sprake van een kredietrisico voor de bank. Om dit risico te mitigeren kan worden verplicht dat klanten op gesaldeerde basis altijd een positief saldo hebben. In dat geval heeft de bank per saldo een schuld aan de klant oftewel een deposito.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5            
Heeft u inzage gekregen in welke posten er op de balans stonden? Gaat het om derivaten, ‘asset pooling’ of iets anders? Kunt u inzage geven in deze posten, die op de balans gezet zijn in de periode waarin ING staatssteun kreeg en verder een Asset Quality Review &amp;#40;AQR&amp;#41; onderging?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
De voornoemde openbare jaarrekeningen van ING geven inzage in posten van de geconsolideerde balans, alsook in het effect van eventuele nettering die verband houdt met ‘cash pooling’. De geconsolideerde balans in de jaarrekening staat los van de prudentiële behandeling voor de Asset Quality Review &amp;#40;AQR&amp;#41;. Bij de AQR van 2014 is de totale blootstelling van alle deelnemende banken, inclusief ING, op individuele basis openbaar gepubliceerd. Over de uitkomsten hiervan is uw Kamer geïnformeerd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6              
Is er voldoende intern en extern toezicht geweest in het kader van de anti-witwaswetgeving op de ‘asset pooling’ en de ‘off balance sheet vehicles’?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
DNB houdt op basis van de Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorisme &amp;#40;Wwft&amp;#41; integriteitstoezicht op onder meer banken. De Wwft ziet, kort samengevat, op de dienstverlening aan klanten en transacties die daarbij horen. Instellingen dienen zelf een inschatting te maken van de diensten en producten die zij aanbieden en de risico’s die daaraan verbonden zijn. Daarbij dienen zij rekening te houden met onder andere de complexiteit van het product of de dienst, de leveringskanalen en geografische risico’s. Naast de inherente risico’s van het product of de dienst dient een instelling ook te kijken naar de inherente klantrisico’s. Dit geldt voor alle klanten, ook indien een klant meerdere rekeningen heeft binnen een cash pool.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7             
Heeft het ministerie en/of De Nederlandsche Bank &amp;#40;DNB&amp;#41; en/of de Autoriteit Financiële Markten &amp;#40;AFM&amp;#41; &amp;#40;in geval er sprake is van effectenkrediet&amp;#41; onderzoek gedaan in 2014 &amp;#40;of eerder&amp;#41; naar de aanzienlijke ‘asset pooling’ binnen ING?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
De jaarlijkse verslaggeving staat los van de prudentiële kwalificatie, bijvoorbeeld voor de leverage ratio. Het is aan de prudentiële toezichthouder om – los van de jaarlijkse verslaggeving – te controleren of nettering binnen rekeningen van een klant in lijn is met de prudentiële regels. Over de leverage ratio en de toepassing ervan was de minister van Financiën op de hoogte, vanwege het belang voor de financiële stabiliteit &amp;#40;zie het antwoord op vraag 10&amp;#41;.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vanuit prudentieel oogpunt worden strenge eisen gesteld aan het wel of niet netteren van rekeningen van een klant. Het voorstel van de Europese Commissie ten aanzien van de kapitaaleisen eist dat fysieke saldering van cash pools dagelijks - of naar mening van de toezichthouder frequent genoeg - plaatsvindt. De onderhandelingen over dit voorstel zijn nog niet afgerond.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is aan de toezichthouder om, indien nodig, onderzoek naar cash pooling te doen. De toezichthouder doet geen mededelingen over individuele banken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8             
Kunt u aangeven of het rapport van de AFM uit maart 2015 over &amp;#40;onder meer&amp;#41; onderpandverplichtingen bij rentederivaten als grondslag heeft gediend voor ‘asset pooling’?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik zie geen reden om aan te nemen dat hier een verband is.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9             
Heeft ING of de accountant van ING overleg gevoerd met het ministerie over het feit dat zij deze post niet op de balans zou zetten? Zo ja, kunt u daarvan details geven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie mijn antwoord op vraag 10.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10        
Heeft ING of de accountant van ING overleg gevoerd met de regering of het ministerie over deze enorme correctie in de balans? Zo ja, kunt u daarvan details geven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 10        
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is aan de accountant om de jaarrekening te controleren op basis van de standaarden voor verslaggeving. De AFM houdt vervolgens toezicht op de financiële verslaggeving van effectenuitgevende instellingen. Het ministerie is niet verantwoordelijk voor de inhoud van de jaarlijkse publicatie van de jaarrekening van individuele banken. Daarom is er geen overleg met banken of hun accountants over de toepassing van de internationale verslaggevingsstandaarden in de praktijk. Ook niet met ING en haar accountant.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De jaarlijkse verslaggeving staat los van de prudentiële kwalificatie, bijvoorbeeld voor de leverage ratio. Het is aan de prudentiële toezichthouder om – los van de jaarlijkse verslaggeving – te controleren of nettering binnen rekeningen van een klant in lijn is met de prudentiële regels. Over de leverage ratio en de toepassing ervan was de minister van Financiën wel op de hoogte, vanwege het belang voor de financiële stabiliteit. Het ministerie is in 2015 door ING op de hoogte gesteld van het feit dat het wel of niet netteren van ‘cash pooling’ van invloed kan zijn op de totale blootstelling van een bank en daarmee ook de leverage ratio. Dit is tevens zichtbaar in de openbare jaarrekeningen van ING voor de jaren 2014 en 2015 &amp;#40;zie het antwoord op vraag 11&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11         
Wat was het standpunt van de Europese Centrale Bank &amp;#40;ECB&amp;#41; in 2014 met betrekking tot het standpunt van ING &amp;#40;en haar accountant&amp;#41; rond fictieve ‘cash pooling’ en de mogelijke verschillen ten aanzien van het kapitaal?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals aangegeven in het antwoord op vraag 10, is het aan de prudentiële toezichthouder om – los van de jaarlijkse verslaggeving – te controleren of nettering binnen rekeningen van een klant bij de berekening van de leverage ratio in lijn is met de prudentiële regels. De toezichthouder zelf doet geen mededelingen over individuele banken. Uit publieke informatie valt af te leiden dat ING over de jaren 2014 en 2015, de leverage ratio, met cash pooling zowel op netto basis &amp;#40;lichtgrijs&amp;#41; als bruto basis &amp;#40;donkergrijs&amp;#41; rapporteerde. Vanaf 2016 presenteerde ING haar leverage ratio – in tegenstelling tot de normale verslaggeving - met cash pooling op bruto basis. In algemene zin leidt het berekenen van een leverage ratio op bruto basis tot een lagere of gelijke leverage ratio in vergelijking met een leveratio ratio die berekend is op netto basis. Het prudentiële raamwerk is in die zin – mede vanuit prudentiële overwegingen - anders dan het accountingraamwerk.

&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 12          
Deelt u het standpunt van ING &amp;#40;en haar accountant&amp;#41; dat er begin 2015 &amp;#40;boekjaar 2014&amp;#41; en begin 2016 &amp;#40;boekjaar 2015&amp;#41; in algemene zin onduidelijkheid bestond over International Accounting Standard &amp;#40;IAS&amp;#41; 32?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 12  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op grond van de IFRS mogen banken het nettobedrag in de balans opnemen &amp;#40;zie antwoord op vraag 3&amp;#41;. Deze standaard is gebaseerd op principes en schrijft niet voor hoe de intentie om op netto basis af te wikkelen bewezen moet worden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 13           
Bent u bekend met het feit dat de International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee &amp;#40;IFRIC&amp;#41; de uitleg van de IAS 32 wel duidelijk achtte en in 2016 een zogenaamde Agenda Rejection Notice uitvaardigde &amp;#40;zodat de vraag over fictieve ‘cash pooling’ niet werd geagendeerd&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 13  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de “Agenda Rejection Notice” wordt gesteld dat de vaststelling van wat een voornemen is om verplichtingen op netto basis af te wikkelen, afhangt van de individuele feiten en omstandigheden van elk specifiek geval. Bij cash pooling zou saldering via fysieke transacties aan het einde van een verslaggevingsperiode plaats moeten vinden. ING voert vanaf dat moment aan het einde van elke verslaggevingsperiode fysieke transacties uit van bankrekeningen van een cash pool naar een netting account.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 14         
Is het u bekend waarom de bank niet zelf vóór het jaar 2014 &amp;#40;inwerkingtreding IAS 32&amp;#41; een vraag heeft voorgelegd aan de IFRIC nu de naar de mening van ING &amp;#40;en Ernst &amp; Young &amp;#40;EY&amp;#41;&amp;#41; bestaande onduidelijkheid zeer materieel was voor de omvang van het kapitaal van de bank, mede gelet op de geplande Asset Quality Review?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 14  
&amp;nbsp;    
Dit is mij niet bekend. Zoals onder andere aangegeven in antwoord op vraag 11, staat de prudentiële kwalificatie los van de kwalificatie volgens de accountingregels.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 15          
Hebben deze correcties invloed op de door DNB &amp;#40;en dezelfde accountantskantoren EY en KPMG&amp;#41; uitgevoerde AQR ten behoeve van de start van het Europese bankentoezicht op 4 november 2014? Zo ja, hoe groot is deze invloed en zijn de correcties los van de verslaggeving actief gemeld aan de ECB?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 15  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hier heb ik geen informatie over. Zoals aangegeven in onder andere het antwoord op vraag 11, is het aan de toezichthouder om – los van de jaarlijkse verslaggeving – te controleren of nettering binnen rekeningen van een klant bij de berekening van de leverage ratio in lijn is met de prudentiële regels. Het prudentiële raamwerk is in die zin – mede vanuit prudentiële overwegingen - anders dan het accountingraamwerk. Over de openbare uitkomsten van de AQR is uw Kamer geïnformeerd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 16        
Heeft u er kennis van genomen dat ING op 20 maart 2017 bij de jaarrekening van KPMG over het boekjaar 2016 van ING &amp;#40;ook&amp;#41; een verklaring heeft gedeponeerd in de Verenigde Staten die EY reeds op 29 februari 2016 heeft ondertekend met een disclaimer ten aanzien van de door KPMG uitgevoerde correcties over de jaren 2014 en 2015? Kunt u uitleggen waarom ING gewacht heeft tot begin 2017 met het deponeren van deze verklaring uit 2016 over correcties van boekjaren 2014 en 2015?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 16   
&amp;nbsp;    
Dit is mij niet bekend. Het ministerie is niet verantwoordelijk voor het controleren van de jaarrekeningen van individuele banken, ook niet in derde landen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
   
Vraag 17          
Is er op enig moment overleg geweest tussen ING en/of haar accountants &amp;#40;EY, KPMG&amp;#41; over deze verklaringen met de regering of het ministerie? Zo ja, wat was de toelichting van ING en/of haar accountants op deze enorme materiële wijzigingen en het feit dat het een jaar geduurd had voordat ze gedeponeerd werden &amp;#40;en het feit dat er twee verklaringen gedeponeerd zijn&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 17  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie het antwoord op vraag 16.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 18         
Welke gevolgen heeft het voor de accountant van ING dat er een zo grote correctie wordt doorgevoerd op de balans?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 18  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er gelden internationale standaarden die worden toegepast door instellingen en hun accountant. Als in het algemeen daadwerkelijk sprake is van een ernstige fout bij controle van een jaarrekening, dan zou dat gevolgen kunnen hebben voor een accountant. Er zou bijvoorbeeld een tuchtprocedure tegen de betrokken accountant kunnen worden aangespannen of een instelling zou kunnen besluiten een andere accountant aan te stellen. Het is niet aan mij om te beoordelen of er aanleiding is voor dergelijke stappen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 19        
Welke gevolgen hebben de wijzingen van de balans voor de ratio’s van ING in de betrokken jaren?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 19  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie de antwoorden op de vragen 1 en 11. Daaruit blijkt dat voor de leverage ratio, de prudentiële kwalificatie leidend is.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 20           
Kunt u deze vragen een voor een en binnen drie weken beantwoorden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 20  
&amp;nbsp;    
De vragen worden één voor één beantwoord. Het is niet gelukt de vragen binnen drie weken te beantwoorden.)

9onumy,14,2018-10-16,Getting started...again.,FEO4,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/9onumy/getting_startedagain/,"   I've been lurking for a while but in the last few days I have decided to get serious about my weight loss. I am 24m 6' and 248 pounds, %23.3 body fat. Before summer I was down to 224 but I have gotten off track in recent months and gained all of the weight back.

   Growing up I was always kind of ""husky"" until I hit puberty and became fairly lean. I was extremely active and athletic playing multiple sports so I was never concerned with what I was putting in my body.

   When I began college I fell into some bad habits. Terrible sleep schedule, lots of fast food and binge drinking on weekends. I didnt play college sports so my activity levels dropped off somewhat even though I still went to the gym and played intramural sports. Then I found out my girlfriend, who I had been dating since junior year of high school, was pregnant. 

   By my sophomore year of college I had a son and a wife, we were lucky enough to be able to live together on campus in a family housing unit. Which was great honestly, but this is when my health started to turn. I spent all of my time in class, studying, or with my family.

  I slowly started gaining weight until I caught myself and started running again and going to the gym. My wife is always extremely supportive and never shames me in anyway, unless I ask her to. Having been an athlete and working primarily in male dominated fields, to that point, tough love is something I am accustomed to.

   Entering my senior year of college I found out my wife was pregnant again, even though she had an IUD. By the time I graduated I was 22 with 2 kids. Oh and our university notified us that they decided to shut down family housing units because they could make more money by housing international students there. 

   So we were essentially homeless and forced to move in with my mother-in-law (not as bad as it sounds) but the four of us living in one bedroom was not ideal, my son literally slept in a closet. At this time my wife was also accepted to a doctorate of nursing program (youngest ever accepted to this particular program at 21yrs old) so I spent all of my time at home with our newborn daughter and 3 yr old son. 

   This was when I really started downhill. My hobbies shifted from sports and exercise to netflix, video games, gardening and of course spending time with my kids. Basically things I could do from home. I started to kind of go crazy as a stay at home dad so I ended up applying for a masters program in environmental health and safety which I absolutely loved, graduated this past May. I also got an internship with a prestigious non-profit in my home town and quickly turned it into a part-time job so we were able to move into our own place in a great location. Things were (are) going great in literally every aspect of my life except my fitness. 

   I think I just got so caught up in school, work and raising a family that everything else just fell to they wayside. Now that my son has started kindergarten and my daughter is in daycare and I have some time to myself I have had an epiphany as to just how badly I have let myself go and it's starting to drag me down in other areas as well.

   For about 2 months now I have ridden my bike to work (13 miles round-trip) at least three days a week. But I wasn't counting calories at that time I pretty much just used it as an excuse to over-eat, I hope I've learned my lesson. I already cook almost everything from home and meal-prep to accommodate my family's busy schedule and any juice I drink is watered down to be 1 part juice to 3 parts water. I've also cut out all alcohol for the time being. I've downloaded my fitness pal and plan to log my calories every day, I noticed that since the last time I used it I can no longer search for items and recipes on the web but have to input everything manually, whats up with that? 

   The majority of this post was just trying to get it out there and create some form of accountability for myself. I'm mostly looking for some good health, nutrition and fitness podcasts or youtube channels to listen to while I'm at work or exercising at home. Any suggestions would be great. You all are so supportive and inspiring I am just glad to be part of this community. If you've invested enough time in this post to get all the way to the bottom I would love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, and critique."
9onupz,1,2018-10-16,Crossroad Ahead.,poor_icarus,u_poor_icarus,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_poor_icarus/comments/9onupz/crossroad_ahead/,"Rock keeps asking me if I'm wearing makeup, and at first, it was annoying, but now I don't care anymore. Malaysians, in general, are very sheltered from a different kind of expression of the male sexuality. You don't need to go far, just go to Thailand, and you can see that there are stranger things men do other than wearing makeup, such as pole dancing for other men and promoting bars in short skirts in the flashing neon lights. 

I've been wearing makeup for a year now, and I've managed to reduce the amount I wear to very little. I only wear the Hourglass stick foundation, which is quite light but high in coverage, and a sweep of bronzer around the face to give back dimension and fake a tan. Rock asked me if I wore blusher, which I definitely don't, or eyeliner, which I avoid like fire, and he accused me of wearing the wrong shade of foundation because my face doesn't match my skin or arm... which is not true because I blend my foundation down to the neck, and of course my arms are a different color -- they're way less tan because they get way less sun. 

It's funny how Rock is so clueless about makeup. Anyway, he's actually a really nice guy. Just like almost everyone else in QC. I really lucked out, actually. And then there's that Family Day coming, at first, I didn't want to go, but after some of them warmed up to me and started talking to me, I feel like I really have to go. 

I want to know these people I've grown to like outside of the work environment, outside of roles of responsibilities and uniforms and time schedules. And I want them to see that while I may fail as an intern, but outside of the workforce, I'm an okay guy, I have many hobbies and opinions, and I'm easygoing when there's not much rules and regulations looming over me. 

Well, to be fair, I know some other people don't really like me and want me to leave as soon as possible because I heard them talking once or twice, but that's okay. I understand that if you want the good of people, you have to take the bad too. You win some and lose some, that's life, everything comes in package deals. 

Working here isn't so bad once you incrementally adjust, but I know that there's always going to be something missing, and I feel like it's a clue to something bigger regarding my ethos and destiny. This is a topic we will heavily discuss once I return from my long, long, long international trips early next year. 

And I don't even know if I'll return to Malaysia alive at all. 

But that's okay, I know that if I die, it's because I died trying to achieve a dream. And everyone dies eventually, anyway, so why not afford the risk? Even this morning, as I was driving to work, I experienced something that could cause an accident, which may be a hyperbole, but please get my rhetoric, which is to say that we take fatal risks every day, when driving, when climbing up a stair, when eating in a restaurant. 

Maybe I have a death wish, maybe I don't, but I know that what's meant to be will be. Because it always has, right? 

And if I die, maybe we'll meet again in a next life. I remember that's what Ratna told me during one of my midnight train rides. People are born again and again until we resolve all our karmic debt and learn the lessons the universe needs us to learn. Sounds crazy, but ever met someone that you instantly hate or love? That's karma, Ratna told me. You've met in a previous life. 

Or, maybe, according to physicists, all the atoms that once were a part of me, will scatter back onto the earth and bounce off each other and become parts of something else, maybe plants, maybe earthworms, who knows? 

I'm not a big fan of the concept of heaven and hell, because I don't think people can be easily divided into two groups of bad and good or faithful and faithless. Everyone's constantly moving across the spectrum, and plus, good and bad and faith aren't really measurable qualities. 

And what if I don't die? 

This is actually the bigger question and almost impossible to answer without actually going through it. 

Realistically, I wouldn't die, because I am not the first person to make this kind of journey, I have heard of the likes of Aria and such, but hey, you just never know. But okay, if I don't die, the only other thing that could happen is my life would change forever, for the better. It's hard to say how or why, but when it does, I'll break it down for you. 

Life is vast and scary, but the stars always light the way back home. "
9onvot,0,2018-10-16,Me [33F] with my ex[36 M] dated 6months (3+3distanced) broke up one week ago;need advice if i should try to make it work,cloisonnenail,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9onvot/me_33f_with_my_ex36_m_dated_6months_33distanced/,"We met when I was exchanging in his city. He's kind and patient. I feel comfortable being with him. I told him I will find an internship in his city and stay with him; and after my graduation I will find a job in his city. He said when I come back, we will move in together. He likes kids, and he told me he want kid with me. We've dated for 3 months before I had to go back to my city(3h by flight) to finish my studies. We told each other ""i love you"" and he promised to visit me.

He smoke joints on a daily basis and i had problems with it. I asked him to quit, he promised to cut back and eventually quit.

After I left, I was actively applying for internship in his city but also other places. After 2 months, i was getting impatient and scared, feeling we have been drifted away. One of the internship accepted me, it was 2h by flight away from him. It was a good oppotunity for me, but I did not want to go because i don't want to be away from him.

I told him I might take the internship and he was sad, kept talking about i will get another internship in his city. But later he encouraged me to go. I put a pause to my response to the internship, and i asked that I fly back to his city and move in together with him immediately. And I will finish my thesis in his city, in the meanwhile we preceed to marrige and family.

The next day he broke up with me, revealing that he was smoking joint the whole time and he owe a huge fine to the government (insurance fine). Further, he told me everything he ever promised me was a lie to make me love him. And he is now in deep financial trouble to survive himself, let alone getting married and having kids. Since we broke, he has been working nonstop and deliberately shutting me out.

I don't know what to do. Should I try to make it work again or should I give up and forget?

TL;DR; : Distanced relationship with info being hidden gone bad, do i give up?"

I really fucked up and underestimated how much work this class is. I've taken summer classes the last 2 summers and I wanted to try for an internship this next one without summer classes to sort of take a break from summer classes. I want to graduate on time, but will withdrawing from this class prevent me from doing so if I don't take a summer class again? 


I'm a full time Computer engineering student but if I drop Physics 2 and i drop below full time status, I'm worried if my financial aid will be affected Is there any thing in particular I should know? Just sort of a loss of what to do. If i drop this class, I could probably still build my other grades back up and finish strong in those classes, but if not, I may end up just taking a huge hit on my GPA in all of them, but passing."

I have already applied for some summer internships with Morgan Stanley and PIMCO but still waiting to hear back from them.

My question is, would it be better to stay for a fourth year and maybe take some finance/economics coursework  or graduate early and try for internships with some investment banks this summer and hope it turns out well?"
9oopnv,21,2018-10-16,Path to learn functional programming,daredevildas,functionalprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/functionalprogramming/comments/9oopnv/path_to_learn_functional_programming/,"Background - After my internship, my supervisor told me that I needed to work on my program design and learning functional programming would be a step in the proper direction as it would force me to think in a particular way. 

Steps taken - He suggested learning scala, but since it is not strictly functional I was not really ""forced"" to program in a functional style.

Programming Language Experience - Java, Python, Scala

Most functional programming language tutorials/books out there focus on the language and not ""functional programming"" (The language is always the easy part - It does not take that much time to pick it up).

I would love any suggestions on how to go about learning functional programming. Thanks."
9opcen,8,2018-10-16,Anybody else keep trying to quit but then ‘life’ happens and you give yourself an excuse to keep smoking?,wu-tang-man,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/9opcen/anybody_else_keep_trying_to_quit_but_then_life/,"So a bit of background about my personal situation I guess...

I keep getting it into my head to stop smoking, to the point where there’s been numerous times I’ve stubbed out a J halfway through ready to quit as I’ve realised weed has way too much of a hold over my life, and I look back at the last few years and realize a lot of it is filled with smoking. It’s been a long process getting to this point as I’ve been smoking pretty regularly for 6/7 years. 

To be honest it’s not actually really affected my life negatively... I graduated with good grades, I’ve travelled a fair bit since then and got myself some good jobs and internships. I also have good relationships with friends and girlfriends. I am not an antisocial person and I exercise regularly. I have had some anxiety/depression over the years and at its worst point I quit weed for 6 months or so and it did really help. 
I actually can almost pinpoint when the anxiety started and it was when I was smoking while very hungover and the cops pulled up to the house- we panicked and hid all the shit but the police never actually knocked on the door... who knows. But it super freaked me out and I had a mini panic attack, the effects of which stuck with me and would hit me every now and then. 

The main reason I’m quitting is that I feel guilty when I smoke. I can’t even enjoy the high that much anymore because I feel bad for doing it. I know it’s not good for my mental or physical health and I beat myself up about not being able to resist and stopping when I’ve told myself I will. I’ll wake up and say ‘okay, this is it, I’m not gonna blaze’ but then by evening time, my friend will light a J and I’ll just go ahead and do it and then wake up the next morning regretting it. 
I also feel like I’m just not that interested in getting high any more. It’s just a bit boring and gets me into some bad habits (I’m really good at healthy eating usually- the only time I eat fast food or sweets is when I’m blazed).

So onto what the title was about...

I’ve been moving around a lot this year and have lived in three different countries so far. Each time I move I think ‘this is the perfect chance to start afresh- I won’t know anyone who can sort and a new place, new friends etc means I can try something different.’ But then ‘life’ will happen and I’ll end up blazing. The first time I moved I met up with some old friends who blaze and I was like ‘ah for old times sake...’ and then ended up blazing multiple times a week. 
The most recent move started well- I didn’t blaze for a month or so but then made friends with people who did, and I’m currently living in an area known for its natural beauty so blazing while out camping or hiking was too tempting. Tbh at first, it was nice to have a blaze again after a few weeks off and while I was out doing good nature stuff. But now I’m back in the same old routine- smoking almost every day and a lot of evenings I’ll stay in with friends and watch Netflix/talk shit.

I’m heading back home in a months time. Again I’m thinking ‘okay- new start, get into the gym, stop smoking etc’, but already I know when I meet up with childhood friends I haven’t seen for close to a year I will wanna smoke with them, and as it approaches Christmas I will wanna have some Christmas smokes with friends over board games and mulled wine. 

I think my plan is as follows- when I return home, focus on exercise and meditation etc. I’m not going to say I’ll quit completely straight away because I know I will have the occasional smoke with friends, and I’ll feel guilty if I said I was gonna quit. So my aim is to only smoke when it’s a big sesh or a special occasion, and to definitely not smoke if it’s just to stay in and watch tv. Then I want to cut down even more, hopefully leading to me just stopping completely in time for the next chapter/move of my life.

I don’t know what I wanted to get out this post... Maybe a discussion with other people in a similar position, or people who have gone through/going through the same stuff. Or just advice on my plan. I know this sub isn’t about ‘cutting down’ but I think this strategy is what will work best for me.

Anyway, love to everyone who read this and is going through something similar. We can all do this! X"
9ophg2,3,2018-10-16,"I Received a $2,100 Emergency Room Bill for a Strep Test",SupplyChainOne,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9ophg2/i_received_a_2100_emergency_room_bill_for_a_strep/,"Hi there everyone, hope the day is treating you well!

&amp;#x200B;

As the title suggests, I've just received a couple bills in the mail for an *emergency room* visit over this past summer. The first bill consists of $1,915 in charges;

* $108.33 for *Lab Services*
* $1,807 for *Emergency Services*

The second bill totals $149.52, it was $244 and it appears my insurance paid $94.48 of the total. I believe this is a charge for the doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

Total Amount Due: $2,064.52

&amp;#x200B;

To provide some context;

* I was working an internship over the summer and had a sore throat worse than anything I'd ever had, and even had mouth sores arise which had never happened when I'd had painful sore throats in the past. I was worried it was strep or potentially something worse, so I took the day off to get a strep test.

&amp;#x200B;

* Over the summer I was living a few hours from my general physician so I needed to get a strep test done somewhere close, I decided to visit *UCHealth,* a very small stand-alone emergency room close to home that was new to our town. It was early in the morning, absolutely no other patients were there, and although my throat was absolutely killing me I was very relaxed and did not require ""*urgent care"".* I spoke with the employee at the front desk very casually, described my symptoms, filled out some paperwork, and was taken back to see a nurse.

&amp;#x200B;

* The nurse tested my blood pressure, took my heart rate, briefly looked at my throat, etc etc, then swabbed my throat took the sample back for a strep test. A doctor walked in shortly after, took another look at my throat, asked some questions, etc etc, about what you'd expect from your general visit for a strep test. Nurse came back, strep test was negative, and the doctor wrote me a prescription for 800mg of ibuprofen (ibuprofen entirely) for the pain. I was free to leave, and spent no more than 30 minutes total in the building.

&amp;#x200B;

So I just now received these bills and I'm unsure what to do! I've never visited a stand-alone emergency room before and I didn't even consider potentially being billed for *emergency services.* I suppose this was my own fault for being unaware of the costs for this type of facility.

&amp;#x200B;

I called the support number on my bill and was told I was rated a **Level 3** out of 5 in regards to *emergency level.* This was ridiculous to me! I was so absolutely calm and casual. I asked to dispute the level 3 I was rated.

&amp;#x200B;

I just received a voicemail now 10 days after filing a dispute and I was told my dispute was denied after review, and ""**level 3 is correct""** because I had ""several interventions during the encounter; a point of care strep A test, prescription medication, and discharge, so this emergency room level 3 is appropriate for the visit.""

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am now, unsure what to do. Should I call back and dispute this further? Is there anything else I can do? The emergency services bill for $1,807 shows insurance paid $0. Should I call my insurance? The lady I spoke with initially who filed my dispute for me mentioned there was an attempt to bill insurance and they provided $0 because I likely have a ""high deductible"" - my insurance is still under my parents name and unfortunately I'm not familiar at all with my insurance, how deductibles work, or how exactly my insurance may handle this case.

&amp;#x200B;

I sincerely do not believe my visit was worth anywhere close to $2,100 total.. however, I'm not sure how to go about fighting this considering my dispute was refused. I realize this may be my own fault for being unaware of urgent care fees, but at the end of it all I feel like this is completely unjust for the service I was provided. I could've had the same procedure done with my normal physician for under $100 no question.

&amp;#x200B;

It's even more frustrating considering UCHealth is owned by Colorado University, the university I am currently a student at. I simply can't afford this bill, and my parents can't afford it at this time either. Any and all suggestions as to what I should do moving forward are GREATLY appreciated.. thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

edit: It is a stand-alone emergency room, not an urgent care center as I had initially typed."
9oqcj3,13,2018-10-16,I want to quit because I hate the person weed has turned me into,evozog,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/9oqcj3/i_want_to_quit_because_i_hate_the_person_weed_has/,"I’ve been wanting to quit for a while, and I want to start today. I recently found this sub, and it felt like the perfect place to lay out everything that’s been weighing on my mind regarding this decision. It’s a bit of a rant, but it felt really good to let it out so thanks for being such a supportive and inspirational sub! 

I feel like with this recent movement of legalization and social acceptance of marijuana, it is seen and regarded by many as a safe and beneficial hobby. While I agree marijuana can do some amazing things medically and mentally for some people, i don’t feel like anyone around me is talking about how detrimental it can be to some peoples mental and physical health. I wish someone would’ve told me it was possible to fall deeply into a rabbit hole of addiction. Some people can have a joint after a long day of work occasionally and be fine. That’s not me. If I get a little high, I want to keep getting high, and high, and high. I’m definitely addicted to marijuana. This is My first time saying this out loud. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed of what I have allowed to happen to myself and my life because of weed. My freshman year of college, pre med, I had a 4.0 gpa. When I started smoking weed the next year, those grades went down. Once living off campus, i was smoking most of the day. Getting ready for class? Smoke. home from class? Smoke. Smoke and sit around and do nothing. When it was time to study, it would be studying WHILE smoking. I convinced myself that it wasn’t affecting my brain in any way, and that the high helped my creativity and made my studying more efficient. Once the smoking started, the anxiety started, and to get rid of the anxiety I would smoke more. 

My senior year of college was a mess. I was depressed, anxious, living in a hostile house, and stressed beyond belief for the MCAT. I would spend most of my time locked in my room, smoking, by myself. Eating vast amounts of terrible food until my stomach was full, then smoking more and shoving more food down my throat. I would even smoke to study for the MCAT! That was normal to me! This was all normal to me! I am so ashamed. I know I could’ve done better on the exam if i studied with a clear mind and made that a priority over marijuana, but that didn’t happen. 

I have been smoking everyday for 3 years. Towards the end of my senior year, I was going through a quad a week, maybe more. This summer, I went on an amazing medical internship in Bolivia for 5 weeks, forcing my first tolerance break since, well, ever. I felt amazing. My brain was clearer, my writing was better, I wanted to go outside, and I didn’t have to worry about smoking because there was no way for me to smoke out there. And honestly, I didn’t think about it a lot because I was busy doing something, exciting things, all the time. My anxiety was ridiculously low, my energy level was through the roof, and i really started thinking about how much weed has taken away from me. 

I am in the worst shape I have ever been in. I weigh more than I ever thought I would weigh, and every time I try to eat the right foods and the right amount of calories, weed would throw those plans out the window. I hate how I look, I’m embarrassed. I realize I have driven high before and it freaks me out how fucking careless and stupid that was, how much I could’ve taken someone’s life or at least damaged my own. I’m scared I won’t be able to continue on to my life long dream career, one that I know I have the capability of doing great in, because smoking became more of a priority. Smoking is my only priority.  

After I came back from Bolivia, I fell back into smoking. Just because it seemed like instinct to me. It’s not to the extent i was smoking before, but it’s still at least once a day. But, i don’t think it’s doing anything for me anymore. When I’m high, I just feel anxious and guilty about being high. I just think about how much I weigh, and I comfort that guilt with more food. When I’m bored, I smoke. It’s just what I’m used to doing. But I don’t want to do that anymore. I don’t want to use marijuana in an attempt to escape feelings of boredom or anxiety or scary life moments. I want to began to feel these parts of life again. 

So I want to quit. I think/hope I’m ready to quit. And for some reason I felt like if I wrote this all down, addressed the overwhelming cons of smoking, and told this to you random internet strangers who are facing similar struggles, that it would be a good, tangible starting point to continue to choose every day, not to smoke. 

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading my rant! :-)I would love to hear from people with similar experiences, feelings, thoughts, and even helpful tips for someone at the beginning of their journey to leaving. "

9oqpuz,157,2018-10-16,The Longest Mile,Empiar,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/9oqpuz/the_longest_mile/,"In middle school, I had a comfortable group of nerds and geeks with whom I would discuss herpetology, play Chess and M:TG, watch Monty Python’s Flying Circus, listen to Weird Al Yankovic, and talk about computers like they were coming into style. 

During my freshman year of high school, however, the arbitrary vagaries and caprices of the school districting lines saw that I was to be separated from my peers and placed into a different school on the other side of town. 

I dressed in what were obviously thrift store clothes long before that became a thing people did on purpose. I only had what turned out to be unpopular interests—to my surprise and chagrin, and I didn’t really know anyone in the new school. Early on in the year, I was forced to learn to catch shit from the popular kids and fling it back twice as hard.

After a few months of this, I was literally recruited by the school's punk rock contingent. A guy with a bright red Mohawk, M, came up one day and gave me a mixtape and a letter. The letter was about the spirit of conscientious antagonism that he had observed and admired in me, along with an invitation to hang out with him and his friends after school. The tape contained the loudest and most disrespectful noise I had ever heard, and I was immediately hooked. The whole interaction was like something from a movie. A mentor figure had given me a talisman, and with it, I could begin to master another world. 

Being “punk rock” then became my job. I suppose it was more of an unpaid internship, actually, but the point is that I was there working it, 24/7. I got along very well with M and his friends. We hung out every day after school, roaming the suburbs of Illinois, looking like…well, _Suburbia_ (1982). Together, there was no pointless taboo into the face of which we wouldn’t point, no questionable authority we wouldn’t question, and no unjust rule that we wouldn’t just break. We empowered each other to be our worst selves for a collective idea of a greater good.

This was our mindset going into gym class on the morning of the Presidential Fitness Exam toward the end of the school year. 

During this test, various stations were set up throughout the gymnasium, and students would rotate through each station in groups to log how many pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, and other exercises each other could do, presumably with the intent of determining our national rankings. We were also expected to run a mile.

Running had once been a bit of a point of contention for this particular class. In the first week of classes, I told Coach L that my auntie said I can’t run, on the count of my ass-mar. While I did actually have asthma, it didn’t really prevent me from running when I felt like it, but I just didn’t usually feel like it in gym class.

After having witnessed this, my new friends had an epidemic flare-up of asthma. They all suddenly remembered that they, too, had been diagnosed in their youths. Coach L approached these claims with the skepticism of someone holding a sincere doubt, but who had been caught up in red tape and hearings too many times to risk officially challenging the claim. 

We would sit on the sidelines and laugh together while the good little conformists played their sportsball games. As long as we remembered to cough and wheeze when anyone looked over at us, everything was fine.

During the Presidential Fitness Exam, though, we were _all_ expected to run—no exceptions, “asthma” or not. This wouldn’t really be a problem for any kid in the class except for one quiet loner, S. 

S was the fattest and slowest runner in our class, and the coach visibly hated him for it. Coach L even encouraged the more athletic kids to pick on S. He probably thought of it as “tough love”—hardening him up for the real world or something—the kind of stuff an authority figure could still believe without irony in the mid-nineties. 

Coach L was particularly wound up for the Presidential Fitness Exam and announced that morning that if S were to come in last on the mile run, he would fail gym class for the year. The coach had actually threatened to hold a kid back a year for being unfit. Immediately, this triggered an intense craving for justice coupled with a sense of impotence. This institutional bullying was emblematic of the very machine against which we were meant to rage…but I didn’t know what I could do about it. 

I didn’t, at least, until we started running. 

S obviously didn’t have a chance on his own. He was, at that point, the least fit person I had yet met. He didn’t, however, have asthma. 

I grabbed my side and slowed down, wheezing and gasping loudly. I trotted as slowly as I possibly could, until eventually, S overtook me. The others among the group of misfits in with whom I had recently fallen saw what was happening, put their hands on their knees, and started coughing uncontrollably until S and I overtook them. 

At this point, about a half-dozen of us were being handily outpaced by S. For about _the next twenty minutes_, we did our absolute best to make it look real, but I doubt anyone had any illusions about what was actually happening, least of all Coach L, who had no recourse but to alternate between shouting encouragement by last name to everyone trotting behind S and fuming until his face was a dark purple.

TL;DR: Bully coach threatened to fail the fat kid if he finished last in the mile run, so my new friends and I followed the kid the whole way.

I've been struggling financially for the past few months and I am feeling so suffocated under all of this that I can't see a way out.

I could barely sleep last night, my heart beating out of my chest, knowing that I was going to type this post up and submit it today, asking for help/advice/suggestions/a way forward.

I feel so overwhelmed I don't even know where to begin.

First, some info about me: I am a 26 year old law student, in the middle of my final year of school. I go to school full-time, am a senior editor on the law school's law review, and I also work two part-time jobs (one is at Starbucks, the other is a legal internship for the federal government that limits me on how many hours I can work). I do about 12-18 hours at starbucks and only 4 hours with the government per week. On top of that, I am doing lots of post-graduation job searching, networking, applying, interviewing and other things to try and help me find decent-paying legal work after I graduate. I have little to no time formyself and It is *killing me*. I am stretched thin, tired, losing weight, struggling to keep up in school and on top of all this, I've always got money and my debt and my insufficient income to help me out on my mind. 

I've tried reading some self-help financial books, but a lot of them seem to be geared more towards people who are already pretty financially stable, who need advice investing or saving for retirement, etc. I can't even begin to think about that right now. It scares me, freaks me out, makes my heart rate speed up. I am terrified that I've fucked over my future, because of stupid decisions and irresponsibility.

When I graduate in the spring, I will have roughly $150,000 in student loans. That thought terrifies me. Currently, I have $17,931.87 in credit card debt. In late spring earlier this year, I opened a balance transfer card to send some of my debt over there, in the hopes of avoiding paying more interest on it. As you will see, that didn't come to fruition, and I've ended up gathering more debt since then...

This has all accumulated on top of my student loans for a number of reasons: cost of living increased much more than I expected, unexpected car troubles/emergencies hit me that I was unprepared for, and during both of my summers in between years of school, I was working away from home, unable to sub-let my apartment, and without student loans in the summer to help buoy me, was paying to live in a different city for work while also having to maintain my apartment at home. I ended up being unable to save anything from either of these two summer jobs, had to rely on credit cards to just pay rent/utilities/travel expenses/etc., and now, here I am. Drowning in debt, suffocating, feeling like there is no end in sight. I'm not trying to make excuses, I know I'm in a deep hole and I need some help to get out of it. 


I am terrified. I am feeling so lost and helpless and ashamed. I'm depressed and suffering mild anxiety attacks, which has never happened before. I never thought this would happen to me but I don't know what to do or where to turn or what to even *start* doing now to fix anything. I hope I haven't ruined my life and my future. I need some help, please. 

To help out, I've tried to outline my accounts, and bills that I know I will for sure need to take care of in the coming months. I don't get another student loan deposit till January. I don't know what to do, or where to begin, or how to move forward. I feel stuck and like there's nothing I can do, but I am motivated to try something to improve my situation.

9ortdm,2,2018-10-16,Career Vs. Love,Dalton_Ruch,JordanPeterson,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/9ortdm/career_vs_love/,"Hello Dr. Peterson/Others

&amp;#x200B;

I am reaching out to try and get some advice for a situation that I am in that has my mind twisting and bending at he will of my heart.  I don't need a relationship expert to get my advice from, I just need people who have life experience.  Let me lay out he scene.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been dating a beautiful woman who is smart, talented, kind and even her flaws are elegant. We met at University where she still is and I have completed my degree and gone back to where I was before.  The good outweighs the bad with this and we have grown in the relationship because its made us change in ways that we would have not been able to without each other.  We have been in a relationship for over 2 and a half years and been truly loved each other for all of that time.  We have been doing a long distance relationship for the past year now (500 miles apart) and we have made it work better than we thought it could.  We have been happy together and we have grown and matured from this relationship. 

I have an amazing opportunity to work at the company that I am passionate about and is setting me out on the right path to live the life I want.  Being only 24 and earning a massive promotion after only a year with the company and made relationships with the right people and earned the trust of the people who I work under.  This has got me very motivated to take this opportunity to the limit.  She has also has received an amazing opportunity with a company that she has a true passion for what they stand for and earned a position that was offered to only 3 of the 260 interns that were in the same field.  She accepted this opportunity just as I accepted mine... problem is that her position is in the same city as where she went to school... 500 miles from where my opportunity is. 

I am not willing to give up what i have going for me, and nor is she.  5 more years of long distance will not work and we have agreed to end this relationship.  We have talked long and hard and I have not been able to come to terms with the fact that I will be leaving everything I have to live up there with her.  We have spoke in depth, and I have thought about it for 3 months before I for sure thought ending this would be the most logical solution.  I do love her and she loves me, we could spend the rest of our lives together and be happy with it, but this situation has thrown a massive wrench in the equation. 

&amp;#x200B;

The advice I'm looking for is... Am I making a bad choice by ending something that is certain (Love) for something that is merely a possibility (Career/Future Career)?  

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear back from anyone who wants to weigh in. I am young and have not experienced as much as most people in their life and if someone has gone through something that is similar to this I would love to know what you're thoughts are.

9ory0q,9,2018-10-16,Approach towards learning C++ in-depth,ronaksing,Cplusplus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cplusplus/comments/9ory0q/approach_towards_learning_c_indepth/,"I am an intermediate level programmer with 2 years experience python. I have written and worked on production code in python during my internship. 3 years ago, I had studied the basics of C++(including OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism,  object embedding, composition, etc.). Now, I want to dive deep into C++ and learn how to write high performance, memory efficient production level code. I know the fact that the knowledge I'm seeking will require me to read a lot of books and building projects over of period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

My planned approach to diving deep into C++ is this:

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Learning\*\*: Read \`A Tour of C++ 2nd edition\` book by Bjarne Stroustrup. In case of in-depth explanation on some topic, refer \`cppreference.com\` or read some reference book like \`The C++ Programming Language\` by Stroustrup. In case, of doubts, ask on stackoverflow or reddit. Also, answer other people's questions on stackoverflow.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Implementation\*\*: After reading \`A Tour of C++\`, learn how to build and maintain projects. Build an open-source command line tool in C++ for linux Eg: A CLI file manager like [https://github.com/ranger/ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) or maybe a \`git\` interface. After the beta of this tool is complete, I'll ask for advice on r/https://codereview.stackexchange.com.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe this to be the first step towards C++. Given my experience in programming, I would really appreciate if someone could point out a better approach or provide enhancements to this one. Any other suggestions regarding tips and practices would be deeply appreciated."
9osd24,3,2018-10-16,Some Observations about the Problems of this Game. (TL;DR at the bottom),dillonherbert,StarWarsBattlefront,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/9osd24/some_observations_about_the_problems_of_this_game/,"Over the previous 11 months I've played this game more than any other because at its core Battlefront 2 is a really fun game, and I mean *really*, genuinely fun. Over that time, I've been able to storm the throne room of Naboo with Darth Maul and defend the clones of Kamino with Yoda. I've blitzed the Death Star with Luke and purged the temple on Yavin IV with Vader. I even got to crush the Resistance on Crait with Kylo Ren and ransack Starkiller Base with Rey. This game has given me so much entertainment the past 11 months (over 1000 hours worth) and I'm very grateful for it because it's been an authentic Star Wars experience from Day 1. There are, however, issues with the game that have been neglected since Day 1. Issues that aren't game-breaking, but they have me questioning (for the first time) how much longer I should stick with the game.


Sorry to much of the subreddit for my first point, but emotes, skins, porting over old maps, new weapons, more star cards, etc. is/are not the issue with the game. They are cool, fun, and exciting but there are much bigger problems than any of those. It feels like weekly I see a ""Moar skins plzz"" post soar to the top of the subreddit and while those are cool, they don't fix the game, and a month later we get a CT from Ben saying ""you asked for more skins, the team have been hard at work on them, now here they are."" It's a small victory for the community because it gives us a couple weeks of appeasement while it allows the dev team time to stall on fixing the actual issues. The biggest being that since December, this is the *pretty much* the same game; it hasn't changed almost at all. The progression update was great for new players and players coming back to the game, but for those of us who grinded the crafting parts it wasn't really a big deal. We've gotten two old maps and one new for smaller game modes and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for GA. It's literally the biggest game mode in the game with the most players and there's been nothing new added to it since December. I mean... How??? No new maps, no new heroes, no new vehicles. Where is the content? Granted, the Roadmap is a good start for when to expect content, but holy cow, I think if we were told at launch we would not get any new maps, heroes, or vehicles until October/November the following year, it might be safe to say this game would have died off a long time ago. 


Secondly, the bugs and glitches. My goodness, ""Boba's jetpack stopped working again."" ""Vader is stuck in a choke animation."" ""Luke's force push did nothing."" I mean, are these bugs being ignored, dumped on some intern's desk, or what? I don't have much else to say about the bugs other than there's still way too many of them.

Finally, the communication from EA/DICE. I'm not sure there was ever a more prevalent and telling example of how out of touch a company was with their community as when EA tweeted that video of a heavy melting Vader with the exploding shot glitch. If DICE was willing to activate a kill-switch on Palpatine when he was broken again, why would they not do it to exploding shot (Sorry, tangent over)? Ben is great. The CT's he's brought have been a breath of fresh air and he at least talks to and engages with us (even if he can sometimes give non-answers) and we had that sledgehammer guy before who did the bare minimum to stay employed. We love Dennis because he seems like a nice guy, Star Wars nerd, who loves this game and the community. The problem is we, the consumers haven't seen any of their hard work's fruition since December. Maybe I'll change my mind for Grievous or Geonosis. IDK. But for now, my faith is fading... Anyway, those are my two cents. Maybe some of you feel the same.


TL;DR- The biggest issues with this game are lack of any new content since December (especially GA), game-breaking bugs and glitches still unfixed, and the drip-feed of communication.

9osl0n,3,2018-10-16,I Need Help Planning Becoming Independent.,thorcapthorcap,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9osl0n/i_need_help_planning_becoming_independent/,"I am 23 years old, about to turn 24 in about a week, and a full-time undergrad student. Right now, looking at my bank statement, I have $0 in checking and $60 in savings. I want to become independent, but my parents have taken many steps to make sure that I stay with them until I am married.

I want to move out, preferably being able to move into my school's dorms so I can get support and have resources while I try to figure out my last year of undergrad. In order to get to that point, I have to amass around $5,000 for the cheapest boarding option and the meal plan, and around $500 in emergency money. I am currently looking for a job, but have a very hard time getting out of the house because I am STILL trying to get my license (not my fault, family issues; I am driving, I am ready, I need help parallel parking, no one will assist me). I am trying to find an online job that I can do remotely after classes. I also currently have an internship that will pay me $2000 at the end of this semester and next semester, but the payout will not happen until the end of December.

Right now, my plan looks like this:

\- Make meals at home, do not waste the little money I have on food.

\- Get a job to work weeknights and weekends.

\- Save around $500 in savings each month.

My father claims that he is always teaching us about business (business owner) but in all honesty, he never taught us anything and always talks about us staying home forever. I do not want this for my future; I want to start amassing savings and be able to handle my finances independently. Can anyone help me begin to lay out a plan of some sort?"

Enlisted in reserves late April and inducted around mid May.
Nominated for kapooka for a June course which suited due to university studies.
Ended up with the flu so I couldn't attend that course.
Nominated again for a January course, now I find out I've been offered an internship over summer, hence I probably can't attend the January course either.
The next time I'm available to do basic is probably late 2019/early 2020.

This is simply due to 2019 being my last year of studies but I don't have a long winter break this coming year due to a timetable change at uni.

They'll probably end up discharging me right? I don't really have a choice, as I've been studying too long and need to finish. I'm not really into the suggestion to just defer considering there's no guarantee I get on any course I nominate for.

Probably should have enlisted after id finished my degree."
9ot7kr,1,2018-10-16,Chronic Nausea for 3 Months with No Explanation,Chaleia,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/9ot7kr/chronic_nausea_for_3_months_with_no_explanation/,"Hey all, I am reaching out to this subreddit as I am losing hope in finding out what is up with me. A little background about me is that I am a 20 yr old female, 5'8"", about 190lbs, and causcasian. On August 7th I woke up after drinking the night before and vomited 4 times. I expected this to be a normal hangover, but after not being able to keep fluids down and being insanely nauseous without relief I headed to my urgent care. At urgent care they tested my urine and found I had abnormal bacteria/urine results so they put me on Bactrim and told me I may have the stomach flu. Well fast forward to now and I am still dealing with chronic nausea everyday without fail. In the beginning of this I experienced some dull stomach pain, but have not been recently. I also notice I burp a lot especially when nauseous. I have been to urology and diagnosed with dysfunctional pevlic floor (but I think this is unrelated). My urine was still abnormal about a month ago and I was treated again with Bactrim. 

* I have also been to GI and have completed:

\- An endoscopy (normal)

\- A HIDA scan (normal)

\- A gastric emptying study (normal)

\- Celiac test (dad is celiac, I was normal)

\- Lots of blood test (normal except for vitamin D levels, I live in MN so this is not uncommon and I began taking vitamin D)

* About 3 weeks ago I caught a virus that ended up giving me a double ear infection, an sore throat, and viral pink eye which I was treated for with amoxicillin. 
* As far as medications go I am on; Lexapro, Larissia birth control, amitriptyline (in hopes it will calm my stomach), omeprazole, and have 4 different anti-nausea medications which don't seem to do much (reglan, compazine, phenegan, zofran) \*I do NOT take them all at the same time lol. 
* It is important (I think) to note that back in February/March I had constant unexplained nausea for 2 weeks which they did a H-pylori test for (normal) and it went away by itself. At the time I assumed it was because of the omeprazole. 
* I also do suffer from anxiety and depression. Although I was having no anxiety at the time this all started. Obviously being constantly nauseated has been ruining my life (had to drop 2 classes, my internship, work impacted). So depression and anxiety wise I am worse now. I am also insanely fatigued and tired (like sleeping 6 hours in the day tired), but this may be due to the new amitryptyline they put me on. I have not thrown up since August 7th until this past weekend after drinking apple cider after waking up (maybe too acidic?). I also know coffee is BAD for my nausea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on where to go next? I sincerely do not believe it is purely anxiety based as in general I was in a good mindset when it started? Could it be the lexapro/birth control? I am at a loss and feel like the doctors are kinda thinking it's in my head. I am open to pretty much anything at this point. I just want my life back.

Thanks all, much love &lt;3"

The company agreed to hire me at the same pay rate, but salaried, so I’d get benefits as well. 

I work on a small, very specialized team, and am about 40% more productive than my coworkers (I have data to back this up). I’ve also taken initiative on quite a few projects to create better internal tools for our team. The majority of my team is 10+ years older than me and are paid 25% more than me.

A few months ago, my girlfriend of almost 2 years and I went through a rather nasty break-up. A break-up that resulted in me having a total mental breakdown and attempting suicide twice. Since then I have been going to therapy regularly, starting from weekly to just now getting to the point of monthly check-ins. Throughout these sessions I have learned quite a bit about myself. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and have taken steps to manage my mental health. Even though I have made great progress, there are still thoughts and emotions that seem to plague me, mainly (what I feel) is an irrational anger towards my ex. 


The break-up occurred during my final semester of undergrad. I was taking two senior capstone courses and was employed at a very important internship, all while also working as a TA (teacher's assistant) which had me teaching half of the curriculum of a 4000 level course that was required for the major. Needless to say my plate was full. However, I have always prided myself on rising to the occasion so I pulled up my bootstraps and accepted my responsibilities. This was my first mistake. 

One could say the stress was tremendous, that would be an understatement, but I stayed strong mainly because my ex was by my side. Our relationship was my saving grace. My ex was a very mellow person and helped pull me back from the edge when my anxiety ran rampant. I loved them with my whole heart and I tried my best to show them that every day. From lunch dates, movie nights, love letters, and surprise bouquets I wanted this person to know how important they were to me. But I was by no means a saint. 

Sex was where our major problems started. Both of us were virgins but we were not unfamiliar with sexual situations. We each enjoyed foreplay and kissing more than having sex so when we tried to it was just...frustrating. This frustration would lead to arguments, mainly started by me. I figured that this was supposed to be natural; I loved them, they loved me. What was the problem? My guess now is that I had not questioned my own sexuality enough and was trying to do what I thought I was supposed to do, not just appreciating what we both enjoyed. Plus I sucked pretty bad at communication. 

I would say that they would get upset, but I honestly would not have known. They were a master at remaining stoic. I could almost never read them unless they were smiling or laughing. Sadness, anger, depression, all of these were lumped under the same shroud of apathy that they would dawn. Granted they had experienced relationship abuse along with family issues for the majority of their life so I don't blame them for their lack of affect. They also had been involved in a some sort of relationship ever since they were in middle school so there may have been something there but I'm not one to question.

March was when things went down. I actually had believed we were moving towards an upswing, we were starting to spend more time together and both of us had a little lull in our coursework so stress wasn't as present. When she texted me that she did not love me anymore my heart and mind shattered. I went full panic mode. They never gave me any real explanation other than that they didn't feel anything anymore which prompted me to say mean spirited things that I very much still regret. The close friends I had made because of our relationship cut ties with me, I felt so alone. That was when I made my first attempt. After I failed this had a huge rippling effect that brought about a little structure to my life that got me through to graduation. My professors, family, and friends helped me stay grounded and together but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. 

Before the break-up she had mentioned wanting to spend more time with a person she knew from high school that was in their nursing program. I didn't think much of it at the time but after what she said I became suspicious. A couple months past, I was still reeling but my life continued on towards graduation and I started to give up on connecting dots that may not have even really been there; however, fate had other plans. A few friends took me out to see Infinity War since my ex and I had always made it a point to watch all the Marvel movies. After the screening, I exited the theater to run directly into my ex on a date with the 'friend' they had mentioned prior to our break-up. At this point it had not even been two months since they had ended things with me. I was devastated. 

The following months seem like a life time age. I attempted to take my own life once again but failed out of fear. I also poorly chose to snoop their Facebook and receive confirmation that she was now ""in a wonderful relationship."" I had more intense session with a new therapist and started medication. Eventually, not long after the cinema incident, I graduated and earned my Bachelor's degree. I have taken time to improve my mental health and I have come a long way from where I was. I have engaged in hobbies that I had long since abandoned, such as creative writing. A close friend and I are even getting ready to embark on starting a YouTube channel together, something we have wanted to do since high school. My outlook on my life and its worth has changed as well. I'm no longer bound by my pain. Although I do realize now that I used to use people as a means to offload my stress and anxieties in order to focus on my goals. I know that I did this to my ex and cannot help but feel remorse. I am also quite hesitant to seek out any form of new relationship because I cannot help but feel like things would end poorly. Deep down I feel like I won't be able to truly trust someone because of my experience. 

I sometimes just get these feelings of anger when I think about this whole situation and where my life is right now. I am so grateful for so many things, and yet I get so upset that my ex gets to go right into the arms of another person, love them as though I never mattered, and be happy while I tend to my wounds. I truly want to work through these emotions, I want to be able to say, ""Good, they get to be happy. On with my life,"" but there are times when that is so difficult. We used to watch sunrises, and I used to think how beautiful they were when the light shown onto their face. The sun still rises, even after our relationship ended. I tell myself that sunrises are still beautiful, even if it's for a different reason now. But the anger still lingers...am I an asshole for feeling that anger towards them? Also, I'm sorry this turned into a rant and I hope I have not broken any rules.

**TL;DR My ex and I went through a very bad break-up and I've devoted a lot of time as well as money towards my mental recovery. My scars are still fresh and trust is now an issue when I consider future relationships, but I have made a lot of progress. However, she was able to go straight into a happy relationship. I want to feel happy for them but I cannot shake an (irrational?) anger that I feel when I think about the whole situation. Does that make me an asshole for having those feelings?**

21 M, 6’3”
So just as a timeline- 
Jan. 2018
I decided that by the time I graduate college, Summer 2018, I will have finally lost the weight I have been promising myself. At the start of the year I was 295lbs, with a goal to get down to 210. 
With my lifestyle (and possible foolish) determination, I was determined to cut weight hard and fast. I began eating much less- probably around less than 1000 calories a day (I know, this can be a little risky) and exercising a lot more everyday mainly playing basketball and other cardio activities. 
I was losing good weight- by late May I was 230lbs. I felt the best I had felt in years. But I began to stagnate and couldn’t tell why. I was close to my goals and graduated (woohoo!) but then had two months where I lived back with my parents again...and got a little too comfortable. I started packing on weight again and lost control of myself and recently (Sept 1st) moves out on my own again. 
It is now Oct. 17 and I am 265lbs again. I feel devastated and lost.
I have a weird work schedule across an internship and job -
I work 10am-3pm, then again from 6-11pm and am exhausted when I get home. Off Monday and Tuesday. Not enough in the budget for a gym as I used to have. So I have about two hours of free time after commuting to and from work. I have been eating very poorly, fast food and the microwave have been my best friend, and I can’t seem to find any time (or motivation) to cook. 
I want to go hardline with this weight loss- I am not really into losing 2lbs a week on a “safe” diet. I just want this weight gone and feel as though I have enough experience with cutting calories fast as I have done before without getting sick or doing any real damage to my body. 
Can someone, anyone, PLEASE help. How can I motivate myself? Can anyone guide me with information on foods/substitutions that will encourage my metabolism to kick it up a notch? I’m looking for killer cardio exercises that will kick my ass. Seriously I want this to hurt- so I won’t put this fucking weight back on. I’d like to be down to at least 230 again before the holiday season rolls around. I can feel with each pound I put on falling into my old ways of depression and loneliness.
Please help:( 
PS. I’d like to update this post as a sort of diary as a way to hold myself more accountable- not sure if that will help. But as I may have conveyed, I am more than desperate.
Thanks again,

I posted here yesterday believing I was going through my first breakup today. I'm here to say that we did. After 2.5 years she only gave me 15 minutes to talk about it and closure. I know super fucked up and unfair... I felt like trash like everything was just for nothing. She didn't give me the decency to give me the time I needed. All this happened this morning that she wanted to meet up today at 6:30PM. I asked her if she was breaking up with me and she said yes. She even told me twice that she made up her mind. 

Fast-forward to when I was on the way to the city where she went to college (she's on an internship right now). I asked if she wanted to eat. She said no.. she ""already made plans to eat with her friend."" I was like okay... but in my head she was being so rude. She then agreed to meet with me at an In-n-out while I ate. I had already planned to give her her favorite flowers and a list of all the things I love her in an attempt to fight for her. When I gave her the flowers she went in the car and when I came in she was crying a little bit. We talked for a little bit and caught up on the last 2 weeks of space. Then, she went in and ended up breaking up with me saying that she's been thinking about this for a while and the space I gave her let have a clear head to think about this. She said she fell out of love and didn't love me anymore. She said she gave up. She didn't even let me read my list. I fought and asked if it was me, or if theres another guy. but she said no. she said it was her. I asked the reason and she said she didn't know.... Throughout the talk she would occasionally check her phone too and see if her friend was ready to hang out. (I feel like she told her friend to make sure she doesn't stay any longer...) In the beginning of the talk she was like ""I got to go by 7:10... it was already like 6:50 -6:55... She told me that shes ready to be friends whenever I am.. 

I ended up telling her how it was so unfair to me that she only gave me 15 minutes. She chose that city so she can hang out with her friends after and go to a club event of her college organization. I told her how it was unfair for us to go to that city. I told her how it was unfair how she's been treating me in the dark. All she said was one sorry.. 

Then that was it. I asked her if thats it then shes giving up and this is goodbye. and she said goodbye.. 

I'm extremely sad at how I just felt like nothing to her..

I need support and guidance please. This is my first break-up.. I would really appreciate it. Thank you"

So I am in the midst of a career transition and working full time (health) whilst studying part time to get where I want (Programming/Computer Science). Anyone have experiences with career transitions? I suppose it may help others as well who are in the same situation. 

I guess the thing for me is that I'll have to start all over and look for internships which is a significant pay cut, but sometimes you just have to take a risk in life. Having not much knowledge of the IT employment sector, I've been doing my research and just sending resumes to where I can for internships and even graduate positions. I haven't finished my graduate diploma for IT yet (I have a master's and bachelors in a completely different field) but I can't imagine it won't hurt having some interview experience or even getting myself on a recruiter's radar. Any tips out there from people who work in the field? Thanks for hearing me out guys! "
9oxgkm,5,2018-10-17,Should I accept this offer or stay at my current job?,TheRealRory,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/9oxgkm/should_i_accept_this_offer_or_stay_at_my_current/,"I'm 22, graduated University this year, so I've only been in my current job 4 months; I'm a Data Scientist/Software Developer for a mid sized marketing company. I enjoy the job, and its in an area I'm interested in (Data Science/Machine Learning).

About a month ago a friend recommended me for a Software Dev job at IBM. I wasn't looking for a new job, because I liked my current one, but I knew he was paid well, and he said it would only be an interview so I thought why not.

Fast forward to now, I did the interview and got an offer. I've been thinking about it for a week now, so time is running thin and I'm still just as unsure as when I received the offer. I've actually never been so conflicted about anything in my life.

To give the full details, accepting the offer would mean going from £25K to £30K (I work in Belfast, so 30K is a really good salary for a graduate) and the pension at IBM is a lot better. The job itself is a more standard Software Development role for web apps. I actually did an internship doing the same thing, and I did really enjoy it, but the thought of leaving the Data Science/Machine Learning behind has me conflicted. I told my boss about it, who in turn told his boss about it, and we all chatted about it together; they mentioned the possibility of increasing my salary to encourage me to stay, but I get the feeling that they won't, and its been long enough now, and I need to make a decision.

When I talk to my contact at IBM, he likes the stress that with IBM I will have so much more opportunity, to move around, both role wise and physically. My friend that works there also says he really likes it, on the account that they don't really care about you leaving early or coming in late etc. as long as you get your work done.

Its difficult to put all my thoughts about this into a Reddit post, but would it be silly for me to leave a job after only working here for 4 months? Will I get similar opportunities like this in the future, or is this too good to pass up?"

I'm on a quest for a monitor to merge my desktop and laptop experience at home. I've recently returned to university to study EE &amp; CS, and I've found myself exclusively using my laptop for my development, even though it's significantly under powered compared to my desktop. I recently had to wipe the desktop because I brought it to an internship to run some machine learning algorithms that had proprietary data on it, so it's sitting collecting dust.

Ideally I would like a to find a monitor that can do the following:

A. Dock, display, and power the laptop through USB-C. (Should be pretty easy as it's under a 50W TDP)

B. Built-In KVM to seamless switch between the desktop and laptop using the same keyboard and mouse.

I'll describe my situation with some bullet points

* I'm 21 (single for tax purposes), and I graduate this semester ( :D )
* I made around $15,000 from my internship
* I'm currently enrolled in college, and I paid my way through (no debt, been saving since I was 14... whoop!)
* My 1098-T generally shows around $5,000 - $8,000 for the full semester year
* My parents allowed me to stay at home for free, so I commute to college
* For approx 70% of the year, they paid for my groceries
* Our house got destroyed from Florence (6 ft of water), and my parents are receiving help left / right while I had to relocate and begin paying rent
* I pay gas, insurance, phone, etc.... but without their free rent... I definitely could not be debt free now
* I have a side business where I made approx. $5,000.
* Last year, I got raped in terms of taxes owed from my side business ($6,000 last year)

Main question: If a file as a dependent, will it reduce my withheld from my current internship? My goal is to break even with getting my taxes back from my withheld to pay for my taxes for the side business.

Don't get me wrong, I've definitely put back about $1,500 to pay for the taxes.. but preferably would like to keep it :). Since I'm a dependent, my parents receive around a $2,000 boost on their taxes from the 1098-T (and blow it on stupid shit..); however, they did technically pay for ""50%"" of my expenses (counting rent).

Any advice would be helpful!"

9oz10t,16,2018-10-17,LL wife doesn't make sense,throwaway1789712,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/9oz10t/ll_wife_doesnt_make_sense/,"I , a 31HLM, have my 30LLF wife that's not making any sense to me. She doesn't want to have sex in any form or fashion for weeks at a time and only does when she finally ""gives in"" to get me to stop asking.  

The confusing part to me is that I know that she masturbates. For someone that says they have no sex drive at all, she's still pleasuring herself. I asked for sex last night and was denied yet again so I asked her if she had masturbated lately and she admitted she had in the morning after I left for work. I was angry and began questioning her as to why she could be horny enough to masturbate, but never seems to want to do anything with me. 

She just kept saying that it's different and doesn't want to have actual sex. When I pressed further, she said sometimes having sex hurts and she's just not turned on. I'm thinking, that fucking 12"" dildo apparently doesn't hurt you, so my average sized dick shouldn't.  As to the not being turned on, I asked what turns her on enough to masturbate, but I can't seem to turn her on regardless of what I do and she says that she doesn't get turned on, sometimes she just feels like masturbating and she either does or doesn't.  I asked what she's fantasizing about while masturbating and she says she doesn't think about anything, just focusses on the feeling. 

So I'm at an impasse where she apparently doesn't get turned on, but is masturbating at least once a week by her own admission while fantasizing about nothing and denying me sex at every turn regardless of what I do. We just started counseling recently with sex being the main problem. 

The counselor says that my sexual needs aren't being fulfilled because I'm not fulfilling her needs of doing things with her so she doesn't feel connected. I already do 90% of the housework, cooking, cleaning, yardwork, taking care of dogs and I go to at least 75% of the things she invites me to do even if I don't want to. So, I'm not seeing how I can do more stuff with her while we both work full-time jobs and I spend a majority of my free time doing things around the house that need to be done. 

So I'm being told to do more things and then I'll get what I want, but at this point, it's like an internship where I do all the work with the promise of getting paid down the road once I meet the grade.  How much shit do I have to do before I can have a loving sexual experience with my wife that I can enjoy because she is also enjoying herself?

EDIT: I also mentioned to her last night that she's perfectly content with the way things are because I'm doing everything at home and she's getting exactly what she wants, which is 0 sex and all the free time in the evenings to do whatever she wants. It's up to her to want to change because she holds all the cards, sexually speaking. She knows it's up to her to make personal changes or things aren't going to get better. "

Do I send my CV or is that too forward? I would like to make sure he remembers me, but I don’t want to come across as blatantly networking or being insincere for the sake of gaining a new contact.

*****

I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa (but you can choose a different name, if you prefer). I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are.

Ideally this would go on for a bit. I like buildup.

Ideally I’d find a partner who wants to chat and role play beyond this scenario assuming there’s some chemistry.

Sometimes I have a lot of time, sometimes I can only write once a day. "

9p29j7,4,2018-10-17,"[NeedSupport] Wife separated, living in mental health facility, has been dating and most likely cheated... How to process and what to do?",aplawson7707,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/9p29j7/needsupport_wife_separated_living_in_mental/,"Before anybody asks, yes, I have begun therapy. A few days after I found out my wife has been cheating, actually.

&amp;#x200B;

My (33M) wife (29F) had a horribly abusive and traumatic childhood, including serious criminal neglect, physical abuse, and extensive sexual abuse. As a result she has some very serious mental health issues which were not news to me when we married, although I didn't understand them or realize their magnitude. We have been married for 11 years and we have two children under the age of 8.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently we relocated for an internship I was beginning. Shortly before the move she began to exhibit much more crippling depression and insecurity than usual. She has always been relatively depressed and EXTREMELY insecure. She absolutely hates herself and needs almost constant reassurance to identify the lies she tells herself. She didn't start therapy until about February of this year, though. She had a complete nervous breakdown in December of last year and she never really recovered from it. Bedridden for months, countless nights crying for hours before finally falling asleep - if she did sleep. For 9 months I was working a full-time job, not making the bills, trying to care for my disintegrating wife, and trying to care for my kids and make sure they weren't neglected or affected too greatly.

&amp;#x200B;

We would get into arguments when I would try to comfort her and she would lash out at me to push me away. Not to mention the anger I was almost constantly seething with at the people in her family/life who had done these things to her and made her this way. But through it all, we had an INCREDIBLE relationship. The kind of marriage you dream about having.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, in September, I found out she was reaching out to an old flame - not necessarily trying to start a relationship, more like trying to get closure on why they never worked out. They had history and there was one time in the past where there may or may not have been infidelity between her and him. I also found out that she had been asking her family to come steal her away in the dark of the night because she didn't want to be married to me anymore. It completely blindsided me to find out that she wasn't just unhappy with herself and her mental health and suffering, but that she was unhappy with our marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

She had another breakdown the day after I confronted her about it and I ended up having to take her to an inpatient mental healthcare facility. They released her to me so I could take her to another much better facility a few hundred miles away and a MAJOR fight ensued. The same fight as always: I say something wrong when trying to support her, she lashes out and says things she knows will hurt me and make me ""go away"". After the year we'd been having and the back-breaking effort and pain of trying to care for somebody I was not equipped to care for while at the same time bearing every ounce of responsibility in our family, she accused me of being abusive, manipulative, controlling, and an awful husband. She used the same language to describe me that she does to describe her abusers in the past. It broke me. I lost my temper. I screamed and yelled at her for miles. It was the worst day of my life and I would give anything to take it back, but I just can't.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward: She was discharged from the second facility and sent to stay at a residential mental healthcare facility 4 hours north. Since she's been there, she's had the freedom to come and go as she pleases, has weekends free, and has been making ""friends"". There have been a couple weekends since when she has gone on fairly long road trips with these ""friends"", many of whom are other men. She has been using dating apps, seeing other men, sending THOUSANDS of text messages back and forth with random men in the area, and I recently discovered that she visited a hotel for a couple hours last weekend which was about 4 hours away from her facility. It wasn't an overnight stay - it was only a couple hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what my therapist says and I'm following his advice. I've cut her off financially and I have communicated to her that I will no longer be pursuing her like I was. I'm not giving up on us, but the harder I chase her the further she runs away. She knows that there is nothing she could ever do that would make me leave her or give up on her, so she knows she can get away with this if she really wants to. So I'm communicating to her in no uncertain terms that by sleeping with another man or even dating as a married woman, she's changed the nature of the game. I won't share my wife with another man. So I'm done chasing her while she's doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you guys is twofold: First, what do I do? What would you do? What have you done to make it through something like this and save a marriage? Second, how do you process the pain? I've never felt pain like this in my entire life. It's soul-crushing. I'm in therapy and I'm trying to take care of myself - if nothing else, for my kids' sake. But how do you process hurt like this?

&amp;#x200B;

Please weigh-in and tell me what I need to hear. This is absolutely killing me and I can't imagine life without my best friend.

Edit: So many of you have been supportive, helpful, and have helped me identify my co-dependence and the abuse that I have allowed myself not to see for so many years. I am finally coming to understand that I have been married to a woman with a personality disorder and I had no idea what that was doing to me. I see now how my co-dependence has affected me and how emotionally abusive and controlling my wife has been to me and my children. I am heartbroken but I have taking a stand. I've cut her off financially and I have told her that she is free to go if this is the path she wants to pursue. She is on her own and she no longer has my support nor me. I'm currently talking to my therapist about divorce and what my next move should be. I am so thankful to those of you who have helped me through this.

There is, however, a small faction of people in this sub who are compassionless, condescending fucks who have made me feel responsible not only for the disintegration of my family but for the infidelity itself. Thanks for fucking up all the self respect I've managed to muster up in the last couple of days. That's exactly what I needed. I don't know how to thank you enough. Also, go fuck yourselves."
9p2f4m,1,2018-10-17,Major Choice,AshamedCupcake,prephysicianassistant,https://www.reddit.com/r/prephysicianassistant/comments/9p2f4m/major_choice/,"Hi everyone!

After completing my freshman year as an engineering student, getting an engineering internship and hating it, doing first semester sophomore year taking pre-reqs to switch to accounting and realizing I want to do more than that, I have finally decided I want to do the pre-PA track and eventually go to PA school! I am planning on getting my CNA certification this winter, start getting clinical hours this summer, and do as much community service as possible whenever I can. My current cGPA is a 3.76 after taking gen chem, calc 1-3, diff eq, and some gen eds but it will likely go up after this semester because I am currently enrolled in easy business classes LOL. I can somehow still graduate on time in 5 more semesters. The only thing I am unsure about right now is my choice of major.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my two options with pros and cons:

**Biology major, molecular and cell biology minor, women gender and sexualities studies minor**

**PROS:** better chance at a high GPA, more diverse classes so that might stand out?, only have to get 1 semester of orgo (lighter version that combines highlights of 1 and 2) (hence higher GPA) 

**CONS:** only taking PA prereqs in terms of ""high level"" science(P&amp;A, micro, biochem, genetics, gen physics/chem/bio), almost all science classes are 2000 level, maybe 1 3000 level  and 1 4000 level. I don't know if this would make me a weak applicant.

&amp;#x200B;

**Molecular and cell biology major**

**PROS:** more high level science classes, micro/biochem/genetics are all MCB 

**CONS:** Orgo 1 and 2 required so probably a lower gpa, less diversity in classes

&amp;#x200B;

I am equally open to both options! I just want to make myself the best candidate I could be even though I'm off to a ""late"" start (compared to people who enter college Pre-PA). Thanks in advance for any help you can offer :)"

I'm a college junior in Philly studying biomechanics and human performance engineering. I'm set on applying to O&amp;P Practitioner programs next year. 

My school has a co-op system which allows me to take on full-time 6-month internships in the spring and summer (April - September) and this would be a prime time for me to get experience hours in a clinic. I already have about 30 hours and I know this is something I would like to continue with.

My ultimate goal would be to get a paid (part-time or full-time) internship for 3 or 6 months at a clinic. My main question is: How do I reach out to nearby facilities and practitioners asking about this? What is the proper way to introduce myself and my program and ask about the possibility of earning experience hours? I'm struggling to find the line between ambitious and pushy, and I would really appreciate some advice from those in the field.

Thank you!"

Not sure how to move on...,Maybe_Joel,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9p2yoh/my_22m_girlfriend_20f_broke_up_after_nearly_four/,"I'll try to make this short but I apologize if I become too detail-oriented, sometimes I tend to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a senior in high school, I finally got to know a girl named Katie a little better, before she was just an acquaintance. She was a year younger than me so we never really shared classes or anything. But we quickly starting going on dates and we became very close, very quickly. We started our relationship on Feb. 14th 2015 (cheesy, I know.)

We did everything together. I even grew very close to her parents and they would have me over their house quite often for dinner. She was an only child so I guess her parents really loved having someone else in the house. Anyway, I became part of their family pretty quickly.

Fast forward till when I graduated from high school, my parents wanted to send me to a university but the money just wasn't there at the time. So I went to my local community college. No big deal, it was nice to be close to home to hang out with Katie.

A year from then, when she was deciding on a college to attend, she was thinking of going to a university near our city or somewhere about 3 hours away. It was a hard decision, but she chose the far school. I remember being stressed out because I was worried about long-distance. But when she toured the school, I went with her, and I really enjoyed it. I ended up transferring there with her so we could stay together. My parents were doing much better financially at this point so thankfully it was possible.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past two years at college, we've spent nearly all of our free time together. Of course we have the occasional spat, but who doesn't? Even though we had separate dorms, we basically lived together because we were always in each others' rooms. We were best friends and really, everything was amazing. She's pretty smart, so to save money, she planned to graduate in three years so we'd end up graduating at the same time. We planned to spend our senior year living together and we couldn't be more excited. We planned on renting a house with one of her friends so we could split the rent three-ways. Ironically, she really wanted to share a room, which I said no to because we were young and we need space. It ended up being a fight but she eventually gave in.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of our junior year, last year, she planned to study abroad in Peru for the summer. I was really excited for her and I knew it'd be a great experience. When she left, however, I definitely didn't do well. I just felt very depressed and it was hard because I knew I missed her a ton and it felt like she was too busy having the time of her life to think about me (not that I blame her.)

Two months later when she got back, I was overjoyed. We spent the rest of the summer together, mostly me over her house hanging out with her and her parents. It was great. But then one day, she randomly mentioned she wanted to go to Peru for an internship for 6 months after she graduates. It was shocking, but I was okay with it and I told her I was willing to be patient for her. A few days from then, she started to get very distant and it was definitely confusing. When I was finally able to get some answers, she said how she's ""scared that I'm the only person she's really dated"" and similar stuff. It was hard to hear, but I told her we should figure this out before we move in so it's not a disaster. She agreed and told me she loved me, wanted a future with me, and that we'd figure it out. I know guys in Peru were all over her, but I didn't think the attention would matter that much. But whatever. I tried my best to push past it.

&amp;#x200B;

After we moved in, things were good for a little while until the same thing happened again. She started to get distant to the point where she said me touching her made her ""extremely uncomfortable."" It was hard to hear but I just felt bad for her because I was worried about her mental health. I told her I was willing to be patient with her until we could figure things out. Eventually though, she said she wanted to take a break. We tried that, it was awkward. She then came back and said how she still loved me and didn't want to be distant. So we tried being back together, but things didn't change. The distance was still there. 

We broke up on Oct. 1st, a week after stopping the break. She told me ""she loves me but she needs these experiences (dating other guys) before she can settle down and that right now she wants to be alone to 'find herself.'

At first, I was just in shock so I didn't know what to say. But for the next week and half, I couldn't help myself around her and I would just beg and plead for her to come back and ask her questions like ""Why do you want to break up?"" ""How can you stop loving me?"" I honestly just felt pathetic the whole time but I was suffering a lot and I just can't understand her reasons. Every time I approached her, she would put up a wall and came off as very cold. It was hard to witness because I felt like she was now just a complete stranger.

Last Thursday, I lost it and I needed an answer. We talked for a while and she was finally empathetic and showed some emotion when we talked. It helped me see that she's in pain too and that I just need to let her be free. It helped me understand a little better and I tried my best to accept it. I even woke up Friday feeling pretty good. But Friday evening, she mentioned she was going out with a ""friend"" and it was very clear that she was lying. After she got dressed nicely to head out, I sat down with her and told her ""Thanks again for opening up to be yesterday and leveling with me. It helped a lot and I want to learn to be okay with just being your friend. Hell, maybe in the future whenever you do go on a date, I think I'll be comfortable hearing about it so I can check up on you if you're gone for a really long time.""

She said ""Oh, are you sure you'd be comfortable with hearing that? In that case, I'm going on a date tonight.""

I was just in shock because I didn't know what to say. She'd apparently made a tinder only a week after we broke-up and she's already getting ready to date new people. I didn't know how to react so I just told her ""have a good time I guess"" and then she went outside and got in his car, and she was off, just like that.

I felt like total shit and my other roommate was gone so I was just alone for the night. After a few hours, I tried to be productive and and clean my room. When breaking down a cardboard box, I couldn't find my scissors. ""Oh, I know Katie has some."" I went into her room, and with no intention of snooping, I went through her desk drawers and found an empty 3-pack of condoms. It freaked me out and I didn't know what to do. It just hurt so much.

&amp;#x200B;

When she got home, I tried my best to be nice and ask about the date normally. I then mentioned how I had no intention of snooping, but I found the box. I just asked her if she was okay because I was worried about her. She assured me she was. I asked if it was just about sex, and she said no, that ""she always enjoyed having sex with me."" 

We couldn't come to a conclusion so we just went to bed. I couldn't sleep at all. Maybe got two hours of sleep. I called my mom in the morning and she just said to come home for the weekend, which I did. I ended up posting on facebook asking ""Friends at school, is anyone in need of a roommate?""

She sent me a text saying ""Look, if you wanna move out, that's fine, I'm just trying to find my happiness."" I got upset and wrote a long text telling her how she was selfish and that she is completely inconsiderate of my feelings and that she only cares about making herself happy. Like, you couldn't give me at least a month to calm down before you started dating again? And did our relationship seriously mean that little to you?

She then responded with a few long texts apologizing saying ""I fucked up I'm sorry"" and ""you're my best friend and I can't imagine you not being in my life"" and stuff like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I got back on Monday and we talked a little bit, but I still just feel like shit. She told me she deleted tinder and that she's willing to give me time to heal. I'm able to forgive her but I can't let her go. I still love her so much. I had no doubt that I was going to marry this girl. It's so hard to see her and know I'll never be able to touch her again and that she would rather hop in bed with some random dude. I don't know if I can live here any longer but I don't have anywhere else to go at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post. Probably way too long. I'm just so lost and I don't know how to move on. Can anyone offer some advice?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Girlfriend and I dated for nearly four years, moved in together, and then she dumps me. A week afterward, she makes a tinder and buys condoms and starts going on dates. I'm stuck and I don't know how to move on...."

I am currently a junior majoring in accounting and finance. I have a 4.0 GPA and am doing fairly well in school. I am also working part-time right now, about 20 hours a week on top of 18 credits. 

I've been applying to internships for over a month now (tax, audit, and some finance internships here and there). I think I've applied to well over 20 places. I had one interview that I thought had gone well, but I never heard back even after sending a follow-up e-mail.  Other than that, nothing. 

I know some people who have already gotten internship offers at Big 4 firms, meanwhile I can't even seem to find something at a small or mid-sized firm. I'm getting super discouraged. 

I'm not sure if it's my resume that's the issue or if it's the fact that I don't really have leadership roles at school. I am in two clubs in school, but don't really actively participate because I have a job outside of school so I don't even have that on my resume because I feel like it's pointless fluff. 

What should I do? I'm honestly feeling pretty pessimistic at this point.

But me and my ex started dating 5 years ago. It was about 2 weeks before we began undergrad and we were both studying to go into pharmacy and really it was love at first site. 

Honeymoon phase was amazing, it lead to us taking each other’s virginity and being very very open about everything. Not a second was terrible and I couldn’t ever give those memories up. They were the absolute best times of my life, just pure joy and love. 

Sophomore year comes and we’re still in love, I’m living with my grandmother and she’s living at home but we take all the same classes and text all the time. Probably a bit too much but you know it happens. We are hanging out every weekend, going on dates, spending so much time together when we weren’t working or studying. 

Junior year, now to clarify, I’m very affectionate, not to the point of let’s say clingy, but I love to hold hands, kiss, makeout, just physical affection is my favorite. Around this time she completely stopped having sex with me, like we would multiple times a week when we could, whether it was in a car, wherever to like once every 2-4 months. She would move away from my kisses, and say I just don’t like it it’s gross. 

Okay so junior year we lived in the dorms again at college and this was a very bad time for her. She struggles with depression and was to the point of drinking a bottle of wine a day and sometimes trying to cut her wrists. It’s a big deal, but my mother was way worse and I handled that well. I knew how to deal with it and I loved her more than myself, so I stayed. I wanted her to be loved, and that’s all I could offer. Just love, she’s the most amazing person and I wanted her happy. 

Later on say our senior year she texts me one night out of the blue talking about her depression like we were talking already but she changed the subject to her depression. She said she loved me more than anything else in the world, and was positive I was the man she was going to marry, because I saved her life. Her words not mine, she said if I wasn’t there she would have killed herself. 

So sometimes I get super jealous, usually when she was out at bars with friends without me and so would text her like an hour prior and then just randomly hopping on Snapchat or Facebook or Instagram and she uploads like a picture to her story. So I would think like wtf? And lose my shit. I would text a lot of mean things, I’m not going to sugarcoat it. I was saying things like hope getting railed by some dude was worth it. You’re probably out sucking some dick, I’m not proud of it but I’ve since owned up to my issues and started going to counseling. It’s been helping a lot with my independence and also with my confidence. 

So now we take a year off school and focus on taking the PCAT which is basically the MCAT for pharmacy school. We’re working full time and maybe see each other once a week, it sucks but we make it work. We then take it and do well and start applying to schools, planning on going to the same one and getting an apartment, living together for the duration of school and being happy. Even planned to get married 6 months after graduation. Planning to even get her pregnant 6 months before graduation. Everything was amazing it was really happening. 

So summer hits we apply to the schools and there’s two that really catch our eye, her grades were much better than mine, so it was no issue of if she was going to get in. But it was me. So we pick a favorite and stick to it. Thinking I’ll for sure get in. So she gets accepted and I don’t get a reply for a while, and so my ex turns down the other school because of how sure we are I’ll get into the other. So she puts money down and I ended up getting denied. Damn it sucks, but whatever it’s just school we can still talk all about our days and a little separation will do us good. 

Well This lead to her getting so depressed saying we’re going to break up, and it’ll be because of me blah blah blah. She says I’ll get jealous I assure her I won’t and continue to work on myself. 

So I start school two weeks before her and do my thing, she decides she’ll live at home, nbd I’ll get an apartment with a buddy and it’s 35 mins from both of our schools. So I’m going to school and eventually she starts and makes friends with these girls and eventually these three guys approached them (three girls) and they became friends. Alright weird but no big deal. I say something about it to her like asking if they’ve flirted and she said no they’re all just friends and there’s no one flirting with anyone. Of course I know that’s bullshit but she’s naive and could barely tell any social situation apart so whatever. She gets mad because she thinks I started to get jealous, which yea but I wasn’t being my old verbally abusive self. 

Two weeks go by and out of the blue from her she says we need to talk. I say I know what you’re going to say where are we meeting and she does the expected and breaks up with me. Saying she’s been unhappy for a while now and it’s just time, we don’t work well together and I ask if she’s with one of the guys and she says no of course not we barely show affection (really just her) so why would she be affectionate with someone else? 

Fair enough, so I’m devastated, this is the love of my life or so I thought. All I want is to be with her. Well two weeks go by I’m feeling a bit better, we’re still talking but she says we can’t keep talking. Okay, so we don’t talk for 2 more weeks and she texts me around 1145 at night saying shes sorry she’s been ignoring me, cause I texted her a few times a week prior just asking if I could get some closure or clarification. So she’s out at a bar with her friend and she says to me I want to go home. I take my chance and pick her up, and we stop to get food, and she starts bawling about how she misses me, and she’s missing all these important events like me giving immunizations, starting internships, and I just hug her for 20 minutes while she calms down, I take her home and she ends up being locked out. And asks if she can spend the night at the apartment, yea sure not a big deal. So we sleep in my bed and I end up cuddling with her all night, we wake up and I expect that she’s going to say alright we can try and give it a second shot. But no I go to drive her home and she says we can’t do this, she’s sorry and she starts crying I say no this is crap you obviously love me still. To which she replies with not as a boyfriend anymore. I’ll always care about you and I always see you in my life, but I don’t see you as my husband or us making a life together. 

I’m devastated, that was 2 weeks ago and I’ve wanted to die every day. I don’t have my best friend and she’s all I want. She was mine and I loved every second of being with her. Literally every second was worth it. No I’m not going to hurt myself but I do just wish my pain would end. I wish it was gone and idk what to do. 

Please just help me in anyway you can. Idk how to get over her or if I should keep trying I just really don’t know. "

First post here, looking for some insight on a full time position I was just offered.

I attended school in socal, and since then have worked at school in the design department, as well as a packaging design intern. 

I recently found an internship at a consultancy that specializes in electronics. And ultimately I'd like to work for a large electronics company. The thing is, I don't like how I'm treated here. My boss doesn't respect both me and his clients, which makes me wonder how he even has them. In addition, he seems off in certain ways... He will be scolding the other intern, and sporadically then next second talking about how he's going to set up his new computers, and the next second how much he hates people when he drives.

I've only worked here for a month and he offered me 53k, that being 25 hr, paid biweekly.

At the moment I work 2 days at the packaging design place, and 3 days here. The major cons are both my boss being very disrespectful and the drive being an hour up, and an hour and a half down, and I already dread the commute everyday. And every day here I'm just drained by how he acts.

I think if I were to consider this, I might just find a room for month to month rent, while I keep looking for new jobs. 

But on the other hand, I'm not sure how he would take me turning it down if I had the option.

If you guys were in my position, what would you do?"
9p3i7y,1,2018-10-17,Hi Reddit. My (21M) wife (22F) is having difficulty with her first job out of college. Need advice.,somethingaboutwandw,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9p3i7y/hi_reddit_my_21m_wife_22f_is_having_difficulty/,"Throwaway.

Hi, Reddit.

My wife and I have been together for nearly eight years and married for almost five months. She graduated from a great engineering school in early June and got her first 'real' job (not an internship/co-op) in August. She's been working there ever since. However, the past few weeks, work has truly been stressing her out. Her workday is usually 7-4, but she goes in at 6 and comes home around 7 Monday through Friday, and works on weekends as well (reading over notes, email, etc). She's a great worker and was a fantastic student, but she's having trouble.

Almost everyday, she comes home crying, telling me about work and how overwhelming it is. Some nights, she can't sleep, or will wake up at 1-2 a.m. and not be able to go back to bed. I talk with her, tell her she's doing great, console her, etc, in addition to trying to find out what the issue is. Everyone at work is telling her she's doing amazing, but she seems to think otherwise. She's always been like this, one to exceed and THEN go a step further, in school, sports, our relationship - everything. But this job seems different. I've never seen her like this; breaking into tears when recounting a simple story at work and not being able to sleep is not the normal her.

My question: Is there anything I can do to help her? She thinks this is normal since it's her first job out of college. I'm still in college, almost done, and none of my internships have been like this, so I tend to say all jobs ARE NOT like this. But she's not quitting anytime soon. So what can I do to help? I talk to her everyday when she gets home, but I try to stray away from work (talk about our kitties, upcoming events, classes, other stuff) but the conversation inevitably comes back to her work. Her anxiety is too high to talk about anything else. I try to make sure her dinner is ready when she's home (warm, of course), watch her favorite shows, take nightly showers with her, and give her a body massage before bed, all in an attempt to relax her.

But it's not working. I think it's getting worse. Sleeping is hard for her, talking about work without breaking down is hard - I've never seen her like this and I desperately want to help her cope and give her encouragement. I love my wife and will do anything to help her. But I'm lost on what I can do to help this situation. I don't see her at work, I don't know if it's really that difficult or if she is putting pressure on herself to be perfect; I just see her crying everyday when she comes home. And I don't like that. We don't like that. I want to try and help.

So, Reddit, do you have any advice for a fledgling married couple? How can I help her cope with her extreme anxiety with relation to her job?

tl;dr: Wife has tons of anxiety concerning job, comes home crying, can't sleep at night; I want to help her as much as I can. How can I do more to ease her stress?"
9p3ixy,0,2018-10-17,How do I(20F) express interest to crush(30M) I rejected due to being in relationship at the time,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9p3ixy/how_do_i20f_express_interest_to_crush30m_i/,"Hey reddit, I'm in a bit of a pickle.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the situation.  I (20F) was interning with a guy named ""John"" (30M) and we really hit it off.  He asked my number and a date on the same day; I don't know what came over me but I agreed.  It wasn't until the day of the date that I needed to make sure the dinner date was a ""friendly"" affair.  Our conversion went like this:

Me: So this is friendly right

John: I would of asked you to lunch if that was the case

Me: Oh I don't think my boyfriend would be ok with that, can I bring a friend?

John: Gonna pass, cheers

&amp;#x200B;

I dreaded the next day cause I was his intern but he was so chill about all of it.  I felt terrible I didn't mention my boyfriend at the time and he just carried on as usual.  However over the next few weeks we started to flirt again and I really started to like him.  I mean I hated that I liked him, he wasn't normally my type but I just couldn't help it.  He was kinda a dick but also a gentleman at the same time.  I tried to drop hints to him just out of curiosity and he'd ""play"" along but then shut me down.  He confused me, he'd hold my hands and tease me but then wouldn't do anything if I gave him a hint.  I know its wrong but I never mentioned my boyfriend ""Todd"" (23M) around him cause I suppose I wanted to seem available (I admit it I liked the attention).  I'd let it slip out a bit or that other guys were asking me out just to see what he'd do but nothing.  

&amp;#x200B;

This continued for about 4 months until he got another job and left.  He took my hand and told me: 

""You know where to find me if you're available and bored"" 

Then he just left and I figured he'd contact me but weeks turned into months, etc.  I had recently moved in with Todd at the time and we still had 11 months on the lease so I kinda brushed it off.  I thought that it was just a crush I'd get over but it just kept needling me every time I noticed how quiet it was without him. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a month and a half since I've seen him, some of his friends are still at work with me and I hear things about him and I dunno I just really miss him.  I miss him teasing me, pissing me off and even his lame jokes.  It just drives me a little insane; ""John"" ran into my best friend recently and they had a chat about me and she said he smiled yet didn't ask how I was but mentioned he was casually dating and wasn't exclusive.  Feel like he did it on purpose cause he knew she'd tell me.

&amp;#x200B;

Also John visits a good friend of his that lives in the same apartment plaza I live in and I'm sure he's seen me walking my dog in the morning (He use to joke about it cause I'd walk them in the rain).  Why doesn't he just say hello?  Anyways it was starting to affect my relationship with Todd and I decided we needed a break.  I love Todd and he's never treated me poorly and is such a giver but god I feel bored.  I thought living together would make us stronger and it did but we're 9 months in now and I feel suffocated.  Todd understood and I moved into our guest room to sort myself out.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now it brings us to present day.  So here's my question:  

**How do I express my interest in ""John"" without coming off too needy?**  

I've thought about leaving a hand written note on his car at my apartment plaza or getting my best friend to deliver my message to him but I dunno yet.  I can't do it over social media cause I only use snapchat and he doesn't have it so that's out of the question.  Also should I just wait until my lease is over, I feel bad forcing Todd into basically being my roommate but I don't want to let John slip through the cracks if there's a chance he still feels the same way about me.  

&amp;#x200B;

In short: **Had a thing for crush(30M) but then turned him down because I (20F) was with SO(23M) at the time but now free to pursuit crush(30M), only problem is how to.**

9p3kqb,1,2018-10-17,"My Story of Son and Dad, so far...",heresandtheres,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9p3kqb/my_story_of_son_and_dad_so_far/,"**WARNING, VERY LONG STORY, LOT OF TANGENTS, REPEATED WORDS, (MAYBE MOSTLY ARTISTS/DESIGNERS WOULD UNDERSTAND THIS STORY BETTER)?, OBVIOUS MOMENTS OF LIFE, ETC.**

&amp;#x200B;

Hello,

First thing's first, I am Asian, which is already an obvious thing in an Asian household. Also, obvious of whose father wouldn't expect a lot from their child, I know. There are times though when I want to drop it all, BUT of course I can't as I have made it so far, etc. etc. Story goes in bullets, but will be a long list:

\-Did not study at all in high school/cheated my way through of C's-A's.

\-Junior year of high school, my dad offered/forced me to go to an art academy, being a graphic designer himself as he has graduated from an art college and have always love doing design/art. It was an opportunity for him to show me and for me to find something to do with my life as I did not know what to do.

\-Went to the art academy while attending high school of junior/senior year while also going to SAT prep school too.

\-I enjoyed doing art/design as it seemed like an easy gateway compared to normal colleges/uni's of textbook studying, math classes, science classes, etc. I knew for art that I would only have to do design and essays.

\-But comes the journey of up and down moments between my dad and I. My dad came to a point where he was telling me to do this and that, practice this and that, watch tutorials this and that, look at magazines this and that, look at books this and that for all the possible inspiration and design knowledge I can get from the obvious sources of art/design. This was of course hard for me as I have a tendency to suck at being consistent and this seemed like another ""studying"" type of journey for me as it was and of course I should've expected it, but hey, I mean... like... I don't know, never mind.

\-He would yell his lungs out at me whenever I would fuck up a design of typography, layout, compositing/editing, etc., as it was seen to him that I did not practice and look at inspiration enough to create such a shitty work. And when after when I would be scolded immensely, I came back of course with something that he was impressed with as I was scared out of my f-cking mind to not f-ck up again. But this was a consistent habit as it was and is still is a hard habit for me to develop to look at Youtube tutorials daily, look at magazines daily, create/design something daily, etc. It's just all another form of studying to me which I can't seem to fix/learn. I know it sounds immature and I know that this is probably a common problem of kids not studying, blah blah, wanting to play games instead, blah blah, etc. And yes, this leads to another point circling around gaming, but thats later explanation.

\-So with the hardships that I dealt with of constant backlashing, yelling, points of telling my parents I wanted to suicide, points of quitting and coming back, came finally the day when I finally got graduated high school and got accepted into a prestigious art/design university. This wasn't the end though of my dad's reign on me.

\-I am a **SENIOR** now in my current university and I feel like I have lost it completely to keep trying other than to pass and get it over with. But of course there is the reasoning behind the back of my head of what the hell would I do if I was to quit and what would my parents tell and do to me if I was to say that I just don't have motivation/passion for art/design anymore? Oh, and I attend an art/design university in NEW YORK, so most people should already know that art/design schools are mostly more expensive than Ivy Leagues, especially in New York and California, so the amount of money that my parents have invested is insane on top of dorm/apartment fees. (But I did nearly get full scholarship so... Still, we are not rich, do not misunderstand. My parents just have a high sacrifice amount for me... WHICH I know, I should be thankful for and repay them back with motivation and passion, but it just doesn't seem to work that way for me...)

\-So main problem is that over the almost four years of my college life is that I barely did any ""self-practice"". Meaning that all the things that my dad wants me to do of look at Youtube tutorials, look at magazines for inspiration, etc. etc., has BARELY happened over the almost four years. I literally have been making it through of life and death and moments where I do still have and developed my design knowledge and skills as just doing the work from school and internships.

\-I have been blessed though to have attended 3 internships so far like Viacom, MTV, and 26FIVE. All 3 being very rare/high opportunities for young college designers who are looking for internships, these 3 out many others are listed as very hard to get into. So my college life hasn't been totally shit as I did love to work in the real world, it's just school that's dreading me down into an abyss of not wanting to study simply. BUT that I have to do and still study on a daily basis BECAUSE the art/design community is very competitive, blah blah, etc. Its well-known and yes it is very competitive to survive and such.

\-Over the years, yes, I have been blessed, forgiven, scolded, etc., of an up-down journey. It has been fun, boring, tiring, suicidal, difficult etc. And once again, yes I do know that most/all people have been through this type of journey, yes I know, I get it. I'm just simply getting this off my chest, so don't get me wrong.

\-It's just that as I do obviously know what is right and wrong, I simply can't seem to do the right, consistently.

\-What I mean by this first of all is that I am addicted to gaming. But more as in a sense as I genuinely enjoy gaming. And of course ANYONE can ""genuinely"" enjoy gaming as it is widely seen to be enjoyed. But at the same time it is of course looked down upon and as a waste of time and it certainly is of different aspects. I've been gaming the second I have touched a computer. **THIS PART IS JUST TANGENT STORY ON THE SIDE THAT COULD BE ANOTHER STORYTELLING.** **-&gt;(My parents never really stopped me at at all as if I was to backtrack the story, my parents are the type of Asian parents who are NOT normal Asian parents, but still have their moments. Biggest example is that my dad bought me a brand new Camaro in high school. Other examples are that they bless me with a ""never-ending"" allowance compared to other families. And what I mean by this is that whenever I ask money to go out, they simply provided me the funds to enjoy myself. Normal here and there as comes other points of me being straightforward to my parents.... but wait, sorry, this is just another story though. Back to the point of me venting/wanting advice)**:

\- So yes, I do see myself as an addicted gamer as I game literally every single day possible of 3-10 hours, but I have found it to be something that I just enjoy to do everyday. It has come to a point as it is my last year, that I have started streaming on Twitch officially like around last week or 2 weeks so far. I made this decision as first of all how this even was possible was that my dad bought me a GAMING laptop this year in January when I was starting to get ""good and passionate"" for 3D motion design and you need powerful computers to render those type of animations and graphics and gaming laptops simply had the best opportunity for it. And this proposition was from my dad as he offered to buy it for me for STUDYING purposes. My mom was skeptical as she knew that I am still addicted to gaming, but I just never show it, but she just knows, gut-wise. I on the other hand, knew for a FACT that I was MOST LIKELY use it for gaming and I have been. I have literally not done a single bit of self-study with the gaming laptop since January... And my dad has been on a monthly to bi-monthly basis checking on me whether I have self-studied and created stuff, which i have not. I have been simply telling him that I am busy due to school, which is a factor to him of understanding but at the same time he doesn't buy it as he says that I should still be sacrificing my time no matter how busy I am, which is obviously true in anyone's mind if you were wanting to strive to be the ""best"" in your area or a certain level of being ""awesome"" at what you do. In my sense, I would say I'm at a point of being comfortable, but definitely way too comfortable as the art/design world keeps evolving of new techniques and such as any graphic designer would know.

\-But back to my gaming habit/passion, I reached Twitch Affiliate yesterday, which to whomever may not know, is the level before being Twitch Partner. Twitch Affiliate is a level where Twitch company grants you the opportunity to receive subs from viewer and those subs are payments towards you a monthly basis if the viewer keeps on subscribing monthly. The only difference is that if you're a Twitch Affiliate you get less of the income of subs while Twitch Partners get most of the income. ETC. ETC. It can all be looked up how to reach these levels. And for me, to reach Twitch Affiliate, was more of a bigger passion and motivation to game more for my viewers and such.

\-PROBLEM IS... That once again, I am in my SENIOR year of university and my dad is on the edge of me not creating any new stuff my Instagram platform as it is where my design works get uploaded. He called actually today (as today was the moment of the monthly/bi-monthly check-up of lecturing me, scolding me, saying that he'll take my gaming laptop away as it seems to him that I don't need as I am not creating stuff, etc. etc.) And of course I panic as I have just started my journey on Twitch AND reached Affiliate JUST YESTERDAY... It did come to a conclusion as it is ALWAYS the same conclusion of lecturing/scolding/scary moments that he says he'll send me sh-t to study and look at and then make stuff after to show him weekly/daily. We always come to this conclusion of me ""lying"" that I'll start studying and trying, and him trusting me, etc. etc... Yes, it is hard for me to keep lying, but I just can't tell him my feelings as I have come so far, parents have spent an excruciating amount of money towards me as NY is the land of being expensive of literally everything, and that deep-down of course I still do not want to quit art/design, but I'm just not sure entirely if I want to do this for the rest of my life.

\-Gaming has been something that I've been able to do consistently. And to be paid and entertain through this consistent passion/motivation/habit that I have is ideally something that is logically working out in my head at the moment, BUT at the same time doesn't work out due to the social norms of gaming looked down upon, there is no guarantee if I could make a living's worth of a future family, etc. etc. It just all depends on my luck  towards the journey of being a full-time streamer/gamer, which is technically not possible to make a life-worth income...

&amp;#x200B;

Wow, I have typed a lot. I definitely could of typed probably 3-5x more of this that branches and expands into more story, but who read it at that point... I mean WHO WOULD READ THIS LOLOL... I mean if there is anyone who did read all of this, seriously I appreciate your time. I don't even need feedback really as most answers are obvious common-sense, but I just don't know what to do as

FIRST, I can't self-study for shit whether it be academics, art/design, business, etc. As I simply have just not found something that I can do for HOURS without a problem like gaming.

SECOND, I love/am-addicted-to gaming...

THIRD, my parents would probably kill me/be very disappointed and blame the gaming laptop, etc etc. It would be a family chaos towards my parents, grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc. God damn, it would just be a disaster if anyone found out that I would want to game instead of pursue the art/design career lolol... Its really an unimaginable situation/scene.

FOURTH, gaming/streaming is definitely not a guaranteed life-worth income for me/parents/future family, BUT of course who knows? Might pop off and get lucky, might not...

FIFTH, slightly want to suicide and drop it all, but don't worry, I don't think I have the guts anyways to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm going to end it here for now. Thank you to anyone who has spent the time to read this all.

Hope you guys have a great day.\~

How do you deal with what you are told what God says about you? I'm being told on a continual basis I'm going to hell because I am a male in a woman's body and I'm seeking to correct what went wrong in the womb. lol. I only have my boyfriend who is supportive. My mother is the one who tells me I'm going to hell, but in a polite way I might add. She never rightfully says it, but she's always hinted that if I do take T or change my genitalia that I will most certainly be going to hell. Now, I'm on of God forgives all his sinners and that we are not to Judge one another that will be his doing when our time has come. And so I'm trying to be male and be female body at the same time because we live with my mom. I won't be able to move out until at least Jan 2021...maybe Sept 2020, but I graduate school May 2020 and I won't be able to have a job until then. I'm strictly doing school. I have internships, but they only last 10-12 weeks up to 16 weeks. So it's not like I can use the paid internship money to get an apartment. Plus, we have 4 animals and that's not gonna happen in an apartment so we have to either rent a house or save up to buy our first house. Which we are thinking of buying a travel trailer and then living in an RV park. So we have options. Anywho! 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to believe in God, but I can't be me with the idea that I'm going to Hell. Like, I'd rather be miserable and at least go to Heaven if such a place exists. Yes I do believe in it. Please don't tell me it doesn't exist. Some people don't believe, but I am a believer. I need other likeminded believers not non-believers to talk with me. If there happen to be any on here. I grew up in the church St. John's Church of Christ. Then, when locals died off and new members came in that were hispanic, they decided to outcast the hispanics and call it the Lutheran Church and try to make it only German descendants so I wasn't too happy with them, so needless to say when that happened, I left. Never went back. Even tho they were literally my family. Everyone was related, well the old German's and the families of the old codgers. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend wants me to be me, I want to be me. I prolly won't be me until after I graduate which puts me at transitioning when I'm starting work, but I can deal with that. I don't want to have to deal with my family on me transitioning. OMG I have a catholic grandfather who would shit if I told him I were trans. Nope, haven't told most of my family. Keeping that a secret, I'm now ready to go down that rabbit hole. Anyways, any christian ftm's on here I'd love to pick your brain on how you feel about God and life and being trans.

Edit: so I thought about it all day some more and then talked over with my bf this evening after class. Depending on how much it’s all gonna cost me I’m starting Dec or if too costly then I have to wait till I graduate. But he made it clear he isn’t ashamed of me, he just doesn’t want a target on my back from people in our conservative area to label me as something and then be harmed. At least that’s how he’s putting it. Which does make sense to a point cuz there are a lot of trans related crimes happening in this country/world. But he says at home we are still lovers and partners in crime, but in public we are just really great best friends who share a house together. They don’t need to know same bed. 

If I can just get my mom out of my head I’ll be ok. "

I live a miserable life and will continue to do so until I die of old age.  I'm a college student majoring in something I dont enjoy with an almost failing grade point.  I was forced to study engineering by my parents, and it is just the worst fucking thing imaginable.  Everyone in my major pretends they're the smartest person in the entire fucking world and is a kissass to the capitalist system that enslaves us.  They worship corporations like gods and its pathetic and disgusting.  It's too late to change my major because I dont have the money nor time to go through with that.

My entire family has not helped whatsoever.  Whenever I say anything about my depression or suicidal tenancies, they silence me and force me to act happy even if I am not.  They all yell at me because of my lack of care for internships.  Even if I wanted to have an internship, no one will accept me because of my GPA.  Besides, the demand for engineers is pretty much gone, and if there are, they're most likely going to be outsourced to immigrants who are much smarter (due to a better education system) and desire lower wages.

There is no future me whatsoever, my life is fucking garbage, and I just want to fucking die.  Why does it matter if I live?  I'd rather much not live at all than continue with the miserable life I have."

9p4c7h,1,2018-10-17,"is my ""straight"" friend into me?",brooklynwalker1019,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/9p4c7h/is_my_straight_friend_into_me/,"Alright, so I have this ""straight"" friend whom ive been friends with for a year, and I dont know if he's into me. I'm a straight guy, and id totally be okay if he's into me. I just want some of y'all to give me some advice because I dont want to ask him straight up and make things awkward. I put straight in quotation mark because he said he wasn't interested in girls and lacked a sexuality. He said he couldn't see himself dating a girl; moreover, when I asked him if he could see himself dating a guy, his answer was no. Some of the reasons why I think he might be gay and into me are as follows:  
1. He sometimes texts me some suspicious texts like “I miss you man” or “god I fucking miss you” or “I can’t wait to see you tonight” or “god I fucking love you” or “fuck man why are you so amazing”. There’s this text exchange that speaks volume, it goes like this  
Him: can’t wait to see you ya   
Me: same ;)  
Me: glad I made your night   
Him: glad you were the one that made it happen   
Me: all the way from Whiby (I’m visiting him from whitby)   
Him: god I fucking love you   
Him: no homo   
Me: lol no homo   
He also sometimes texts “fuck my ass” whenever something is bothering me.   
2. He loves Taylor Swift and Lana del Rey (went to concerts with a guy friend he said)   
3. See more in the following paragraph  
He's been a really good friend, too much of a good friend to the point I think he's treating me like his boyfriend. He's bought me lunch and baked me cookies. I remember one time, I had an interview on campus and forgot my tie. I texted him and told him about it, and he just replied asking what type of dress shirt Iwas wearing and went to campus to bring me a tie. Whenever we'd hang, he would look straight into my eyes and smile. One time during Spring break, we happened to travel to the same city during the same week. I texted him and see if he'd wanna hang, I got a response right away that said ""where are you? I'll pick you up right now. We'll go to my favourite restaurant. You know! The one I always talk about?"". He's always talked about that restaurant and how it'd really cool to bring me to that restaurant. He then uber me back to downtown to my place (he paid for my uber). He always texts me back right away. I'm talking bout within 5 seconds I'd receive a text back from him. One time I walked him back to his place after school, and he invited me inside insisting that he should make me something to bring home to eat. He made me a burrito and had me bring home. He's a really good cook. He always talks about how I should come over one day and make me dinner. I also remember seeing one of his snaps, it was a snapshot of texts exchanged between him and his sister. The snap basically showed a text of him saying how he only had one friend, and he liked him. I am not sure if his ""one friend"" is me. He always makes time for me whenever I ask him to hang. Like if I text him and ask him to meet in 10 minutes. He'd always says yes. He knew I had a gf at the time we became friends, and he didn’t care or show jealousy. We recently broke up, and I’m now single. Even now that I’m single, he’s still treating me the same like he’s always been. Maybe just a lot more “I miss you” and “you’re fucking amazing “ texts. He did apologize and said that he’s texting me a lot more “emotional” texts because he’s going through something at work (he’s leaving his internship and that’s why he’s been emotion he said). He hasn’t made a move or anything. He still buys dinner and pay for entrance fee to clubs occasionally. He would tell me that “you’re so funny Elio” and “you’re so cute” when I’m saying something funny. He has only said those in person tho, never once via texts. Whenever I visit him from whitby, he would always pick me up at the station via Uber and Uber us to restaurants. Never once has he asked me to pay for the Uber. Also, he brought me out to this f\*cking fancy rest recently. He also recently had me over for dinner. It was obvious that he went all out. He said he spent 6 hours in the kitchen making the food. The presentation and the food was like restaurant quality. I honestly felt like it was a date. He took a pic of me and said I looked cute and adorable. He even walked me home afterwards. Am I overthinking that someone who isn’t interested wouldn’t go to this length to “pull dinner”? Every time he insists on walking me home even tho I tell him that he doesn't have to, he always insists.

Came to Melbourne for a month on a business trip last month and fell in love with the city. I am very used to moving (did my high school in east Canada, bachelor's degree in Toronto, semester abroad in London, work in a third world country, masters in Montreal, and now work in Toronto). I'm currently working as a full time engineer in research and development. I'm interested in moving to Melbourne and wondering if it's feasible.

About me: 1.5 years work experience + 1 year internship. 
Bachelor and masters at the two best universities in Canada. (GPA 3.5 and 3.9) 
Canadian

My company doesn't have an office outside Canada 

Questions:
1)  As a Canadian (common wealth) , is it easier to move to Australia? (work / permit resident)

2) possibility of landing a chemical engineering job? (I don't plan to move except if I have an offer in hand)

9p4sod,5,2018-10-17,Implementing UPnP,JoebaltBlue,FPGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/9p4sod/implementing_upnp/,"I'm a student on an internship working on a small project by myself for work.  However, I'm starting to feel that FPGA's using UPnP is the way to go with this rather than knowing the host PC's IP from the start as you can't guarantee a customer would (This is no way guaranteed to ever be market ready, but it'll be sent to the SkunkWorks if I can do a decent enough job, so I want to build it with the assumption that a random user doesn't know what an IP is).  I have to develop a system where I have a bunch of microcontrollers controlling buttons/LEDs/maybe a mini display/etc, but they have to be controlled by a single PC.  I had previously done this using Raspberry Pi's but if the company wants to move forward with using it I have to switch to FPGA, which is fine and a good excuse for me to stop solely using Python.  (Also considering trying Verilog as I've only used VHDL up until now).

After doing research into Ethernet thanks to [FPGA4Fun](https://www.fpga4fun.com/10BASE-T0.html) I have a general idea as to how Ethernet works at an FPGA level.  Previously I had been just arping a network to find Pi's based on their MAC addresses, which I imagine might not fly with some network admins.  Thus, UPnP seems to be the best way to go about this, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to implement it.  If anyone has any advice or information about it, I would greatly appreciate it.  I've yet to buy any FPGAs either, but it's the company's money so it is allowed to get moderately pricey but I have no idea what my limit is.  I work in Tokyo, so luckily there are a fair few stores that sell FPGAs which I'd prefer to check out in person rather than ordering online."
9p4uif,1,2018-10-17,Negotiating Salary,phantomp64,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9p4uif/negotiating_salary/,"Hi All,

I’m just getting my career started very soon, contingent upon my graduation.

I’m currently an accounting intern at a private company.  A department that lost their full time accountant transferred me over to their department, and I’ve been completing all of the tasks that were assigned to the previous accountant within 24 hours, on top of creating automation to reduce monthly and weekly process/report times. 

They’ve been very open about wanting to hire me as soon as I graduate. There are a few coworkers who have decided to seek opportunities elsewhere, I don’t believe they plan to backfill those spots. I honestly think I can consolidate two of the roles (accounting position and an analyst position) to within 40 hours a week. Obviously this is a cost savings for the company. The company also currently has an automation initiative, which is where I excel, and they don’t have many candidates for this initiative and plan to make me the lead for finance. 

I have a few questions about how I should go forward from here, as graduation is within weeks.  

Is it too early to talk about salary, if I already have offers from other firms? I personally don’t want to go to them if they have yet to offered me anything, but coworkers and significant other has told me otherwise. 

The accounting position’s pay has a midpoint of 70k, and the analyst leaving has a salary of 89k. Is it too much to ask for 80k as a first full time job? They’ve seen my work output and have been very pleased, but I also want to be paid for what I think I may be worth (to the company), as I think I would have more drive if the pay were higher. I have thought about offering the fact that I can automate most heavily rule-based process and reports, that don’t require human judgement. 

Please let me know your thoughts, any input would help, whether I’m crazy or I should go for it. Etc.

Thanks"
9p4un4,1,2018-10-17,I never wanted to be a burden...,chibin3ko,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9p4un4/i_never_wanted_to_be_a_burden/,"So I moved away from home 6 years ago to start studying. 1 Year in I had to drop out because I didn't like the program. Unfortunately it left me unemployed and it gave me economical problems. Then I started working, well more like an internship. It didn't lead to anything. I got a different job and the boss was an asshole and fired me illegally 3 months into a 6 month contract. I was left once again with no money. Then I got back into studying, and it just didnt work... so again I dropped out. Oh and did I mention I have severe issues with sleep and anxiety?


And again I got a job. This time it lasted a year. Then one day I got attacked by this girl I assume was on drugs while I was on my way to work. She was much bigger than me so I couldn't do anything until a guy got me out of it. It sort of traumatized me so I got an even harder time with my anxiety. I ended up on a 6 month long sick leave from work until my doctor and psychologist decided that I should just quit. That was in may this year. Oh and the police never found the attacker.


Through these 6 years I've struggled so much. I always wondered why I can't find my place in life. Turns out I have ADD... I found out in august. No wonder I couldn't get into uni studies. I'm still waiting for the docs appointment so I can get actual help for it. The psych health care here in sweden is not the fastest...


During these years my mom has been pitching in with money to help me. It hasn't always been easy but she has basically been the only one there for me. I know it's hard on her and I feel guilty everyday for being such a burden. She never has money for herself because she always has to help me.
And now my siblings... I don't even know. One of them messaged me today and asked if I'm trying to do something with my life or if I even care that our mom is getting more and more burned out everyday because of ME. I've been crying all evening. I feel so damn worthless.


My dad only cares about his own family. Ever since he remarried when I was 8 I haven't been a priority for him. And now I feel like I can't rely on my mom either anymore because my siblings all hint that I am making her feel like shit. I know I am and it makes me feel so guilty. I never meant to be such a burden. I'm 26 and I just NOW found out why I've been so ""dumb"" all my life (ADD, which is also why this post might end up a bit unclear and chaotic).


I feel like I have nobody to talk to anymore. I don''t want to burden my mom anymore and I'm getting scared of the thoughts in my head telling me I'm a failure and everyone would be better off without me.


""Mom is just getting more and more tired. Are you even trying to plan for the future or not?"" I can't get her words out of my head. I just hate myself and my fucked up life right now. I feel so fucking alone."
9p5ch5,1,2018-10-17,[Futa4F]Employee of the Month for all the right reasons...,Why_must_you_know,futarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/futarp/comments/9p5ch5/futa4femployee_of_the_month_for_all_the_right/,"Working for a startup definitely has its benefits, especially a successful one. Me personally? I worked for a successful startup. Hours were great, the people were better, and their ""open mindset"" meant that they were very accepting of my girlcock, an absolute monster that'd dwarf any man's dick. I had the perfect skillset for the job, but I had been worried that having such a sizeable extra appendage wouldn't fit their feminist, ""all female employees"" agenda.

So what if I had a huge cock? I could just be as girly and feminine as every other woman who worked here. They just didn't get massive boners that threatened to rip right through their pants at all hours of the day. Most of the ladies here were understanding of my needs, to varying degrees of course. Quite a few were willing to give me a quick handjob in the bathroom, some would use their mouths, and the really nice ones would let me fuck them, though they seemed to enjoy that as much as I did.

That didn't really matter now, because now what I needed was release. I quietly got up from my desk, feeling an erection beginning to form. It was only 9:15, but my cock wasted no time in waking up. I nonchalantly made my way out into the hallway, the slight bulge of my slacks quickly becoming more and more noticeable. Hopefully some lady would be willing to help out in the bathroom, if I didn't run into a kinder soul on the way there.

-----

So! An all-female, hipster, modern tech company where one employee happens to have a huge cock, and the others are happy to help her out. We could do several short scenes with this one, all sorts of angles. Maybe her deskmate decides to hide out under her desk for a little bit? Or a friendly, understanding coworker is in the bathroom when she bursts in at full mast? Maybe it's an intern's first day on the job, or the CEO calls our lucky futa into her office to experience this cock she's heard so much about. As the title may have hinted, it'd be a fun tilt if her coworkers/superiors enjoyed her cock, and it helped her get professional success? e.g. a raise or a promotion? The more ideas you've got, the better!

I think it'd be fun if it was frowned upon for her to fuck in common areas, so we could incorporate that and the risk/taboo along with it.

I was intentionally vague on details so we could pick a ref for her. I have some I like to use, but if you have ones you like I'll definitely consider them! Basing her appearance off a celebrity is also an option. Same goes for any coworkers of her's you'd like to play.

Finally, my kinks(Some may not fit as well as others): Huge everything, bulges, distension, tons of cum, cum inflation, spanking, public sex/teasing, freeuse, name calling, cock worship, non-penetrative sex(titjobs, handjobs, etc.), pregnancy, lactating, tight clothes, teasing, casual sex/nudity, dirty/crude talk, and playing as youtubers/celebrities

Limits: Scat, piss, gore, bdsm, etc.

Please put a pun into your first message~ Can't wait to see those envelopes!"

Justnomil may be going down in flames these days but you guys are some serious supporters.  This post will be long so grab a snack and settle in for this lovely dozy of an update and some explanations.  

I am fine, my husband is awesome, and we had our weekly doc visit today.  We are at 38 weeks today and sweet little girl is super healthy, dilated at 2 and fully faced.  She is also currently enrolled in two tae bo classes that begin at 11 pm and 2 am for about an hour and is currently kicking the hell out of me as we speak, so I can find the time to update my wonderful reddit family.  Thank god she is like me and sleeps a good chunk of the early morning away.  For those of you not in line with those terms, means she's healthy, ready to come any minute and in the correct position.  I have been walking my ass (please leave me alone about my cussing,  I can't drink, smoke or have any other form of fun and this is seriously the only thing I have left) off and bouncing on a bouncy ball and the contractions have started but are in no way consistent or regular, so we wait.... 

Meanwhile in Kansas my jnmom must have started going completely crazy because the calls started last Friday and have spanned thru this morning.  Let me start off by saying that I have to answer my phone.  Sending clients to voicemail isn't an option for me.  I coordinate with extremely high strung contractors, architects, designers and engineers on a daily basis (mostly men who cannot grasp the concept of maternity leave) who will take their business elsewhere.  I love my job and I'm good at negotiating with the terrorist I call clients, but we have built a reputation and in no way am I letting anyone jeopardize the way I feed my family.  Calls will be picked up and I refuse to hide behind my voicemail.  I also don't know my parents phone number or current address.  They were always moving around and getting evicted or trying to skip out on rent so I haven't the faintest idea whats going on with them these days.  Because they are literally con people they are not on any social media that I'm aware of and my mom has literally changed the spelling of her name multiple times to try and hide from all the money I'm positive she owes the government.  She's not smart, but she thinks she is.

Anywho, the first call from her came in on Friday:

Me: Business Name this is Southern speaking

Twisted Mom:  Southern MESS THIS IS YOUR MOTHER (why do they use first and middle name?  It really really irritates me)

Me:  Long Pause and deep breath, Mom I can't talk to you.

TM:  Young lady I want you to know that I have your number.  I know my rights and if I have to take you to court it is going to be hell for you you stupid bitch.  YOU BETTER LISTEN TO ME AND DO AS I SAY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  CPS IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR BABY AWAY BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT AN UNSTABLE LITTLE SHIT YOU ARE!!!!!!!!!!!  I WILL HAVE THAT BABY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!! (Yeah they for sure called CPS and tried to get my unborn child taken from me, thanks for the confession moron)

Me:  Mom I really can't talk to you.

TM:  YOU HAVE RIPPED THIS FAMILY APART FOR  THE LAST TIME AND I WONT LET YOU GET YOUR CLAWS INTO MY BAAAAAABBBBBBY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YOU WILL SIGN OVER CUSTODY IMMEDIATELY AND YOU WILL LISTEN TO ME AND DO AS I SAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!(um you mean my baby, and over my cold and very dead body)  YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PISS POOR ATTITUDE AND WILL NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING IN LIFE, YOU WILL DO AS I SAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Followed by more incoherent screaming.

I hung up, took down the number and had it sent straight to voicemail.  She followed this up with 12 more calls and out of shear curiosity or maybe I am just glutton for punishment I took a listen to 6 of them before I stopped out of shear exhaustion or disgust, the jury is still out.

Call 1:  Southern Mess, this is your mommy, baby I am really sick and the doctors don't think I will make it much longer.  You have a responsibility to me to make this right, and bring me my baby.  I can take care of a baby and you never really liked kids, what are you going to do with a child?  (She just rambles on for 5.47 more minutes.  This is not the first time she has pulled out the old ""I'm terminally ill trick"".  She once professed to be diabetic (she's not) and played the cancer card (nope never diagnosed).  She's also always getting lumps and also claimed ALS and Lupus, nothing wrong with her except shes crazy)

Call 2:  SOUTHERN MESS PICK UP THE PHONE!  PICK UP THE GOD DAMN PHONE YOU STUPID BITCH!  YOU FUCKING BITCH, YOU ARE SO FUCKING WORTHLESS!  I AM YOUR GOD DAMN MOTHER!  PICK UP THE PHONE NOW OR I WILL CALL THE LAW ON YOU!  PICK UP THE FUCKING PHONE... STUPID BITCH! (Can anyone say mood swing madness, this was my childhood)

Call 3:  Incoherent screaming

Call 4:  Southern Mess this is your mom, I know that CPS will be paying you a visit and I hope for your sake you can act right.  Baby listen, this is not a game and you don't want your poor and defenseless baby to end in the system.  Do you know what they do to babies in foster care.  Their are people who will rape and beat your child.  Please Please Please baby, mommy is begging you to listen and sign the baby over to us so we can take care of it.  The baby will be with family who will protect and love it.  You need to grow up and listen to me, pick up the phone Southern Mess.  PICK UP THE PHONE!

Call 5:  Incoherent crying and sobbing

Call 6:  Southern Mess I need you to understand that I love you, but in hurting me you are hurting our father and savior.  You and I both know that God is watching you hurt and destroy our family.  Baby your soul is so dark I am really really worried about you.  No one can stay in such a dark and hurtful place for so long, the devil has taken over and you need to  walk in truth and light.  Baby please come back to mommy and let her handle all of this.  I know you are a good girl and just need to really think about how you are causing pain to others.  (She goes on for a while with the religious aspect which is hilarious because growing up we never went to church.  She has claimed to be Baptist, Catholic, Methodist, Jewish and even Mormon once when it suited her.)

This is getting long so I'll update you guys some more tomorrow.  Thanks for all of your support, you guys have been awesome and my therapist even mentioned that she thinks this is a great release for me.  She was hesitant at first bc she had never heard of reddit and was worried about internet trolls, but I showed her the comments and she is encouraging me to write my heart out.

Also yes, my lawyer rocks and I will be handing over all of this to her for her to present to a judge for a cease and desist first.  She thinks if we send one out signed by a judge we will have a much easier time later down the road getting a restraining order.  She is just worried bc in our state it is extremely hard to obtain one, but she did intern for a few judges and is willing to wine and dine some old friends to plead our case over dinner.  Gotta love the justice system!  Nighty night!!!"

Anyway, she had been there for a few weeks when I started.  Naturally I ask her a lot of questions, and eat lunch with her. After complimenting her on her outfit, I notice her wearing a very similar setup a few days straight. (Professional skirt with a top that hangs just right under a blazer.) While at lunch she always took the blazer off and, made it a point to stretch, bend over, squeeze her breasts together, or play with the necklace that hung right above her cleavage. On day three I ask her to go out the next night. 

We leave work late and meet at a bar. She had taken off her blazer and shirt to expose a skimpy little white tank top that allowed me to easily make out the pink bra underneath and her skirt was noticeably higher.  We end up dancing, then grinding, then making out, then at her home. She has sleeping children at home and a cute young babysitter (20) waiting for Amy to get back. (If this story is received well, I might post about the threesome with the sitter  a few weeks later). I wait in the car for the all clear and sneak in strait to the master-bedroom upstairs at Amy’s direction. 

I walk into the room to find lingerie set out with cuffs, and a vibrator. I’m shocked, having expected something a lot less kinky on our first try. She sees this and tells me “As long as nobody at the law school knows about any of these details, you can choose whatever you like.” She could tell by the way I was acting that I was surprised, yet very intrigued.  She then shows me an entire cabinet door in her closet of things I might choose from.  There was a gag, straps, rope, dildo, and a butt plug. I grab the plug and she comments “only if I’m putting that in you”,  so I put it back. I  grab the cuffs and say “ this is enough for me”. 

Before I even say “me” her tongue is down my throat. In between kisses I’m told “tell me what you want” “use me” “can I have your cock?!!?” I’m really enjoying this, and know how to handle myself, so I begin to tease her, and talk dirty. “If your good, Ill fuck you round 2”. She squeaks and squeals and says “whatever you want baby”. 

So I continue to talk dirty calling her “my slut” while rubbing her pussy from outside of her black panties (She had managed to remove most of her, and my clothes very quickly).  Her panties are wonderfully warm and wet, and I shiver thinking about using her hole however I like. It is mine!  I use my strength to lift her up, and throw her onto the bed a few feet away from us. She LOVES that, and starts to moan and squirm. 

 I position myself between her legs, kissing and rubbing up and down them. All while squeezing her exquisite breasts, spanking her ass, and listening for her approval. I tear off her panties (literally, they were the lingerie type that I can easily rip). And she Squeals and giggles again. I began to lick her pussy, slopping up all the juices while giving her pressure with my fingers. She grabs my hair and grinds against my face, and I do my best to keep up while she fucks herself with my tongue. She has her first, very intense orgasm after just a few minutes of this, and takes almost as long to calm herself down. “Ready for more.” she gasps.  So I tell her “I guess it ok if your mouth gets some cock”. I cum to find out Amy gives the best bj I’ve had. - I took advantage of that many times in the future. –

She gets nice and sloppy, while sucking hard, and taking me balls deep. She sticks her tongue out with my cock down her throat and licks my balls for what seems like over a minute. She keeps doing this, edging herself closer to passing out. When she comes up for air she sucks harder while swirling her tongue around my head and then pressing  the tip onto my urethra as hard as she can. It may sound unusual but my GOD was that the best part.  I last pretty long, respectively, but soon I grab her hair, shove my cock into her throat as far as it will go, and squirt a weeks worth of cum down her throat. 

She had been grinding on my leg and fingering herself throughout this, getting close. So  I begin to finger fuck her rapidly and do the ‘come hither’ motion on her g-spot until she orgasms again. 
We recover some more and she asks if it was time for fucking. I tease and deny her until she is begging for my cock and starts to ferociously finger fuck herself.  I take her arms and pin them behind her and cuff them. I continue to deny her until she is begging, squirming and trying to rub her pussy against her thighs. I put her into the pronebone position hold her down with an arm on the cuffs and count to 20. I then tell her “you’ve waited long enough” and shove my cock into her pussy balls deep, fast, and forcefully. She screams, but loves it. I fuck her hard, deep, and fast, putting force into my thrusts.  She cums, I keep going for a bit, and then we cum together. I cum as deep into her as I can possible go, squeezing the cum out of my balls by pressing them forcefully against her ass. 

I collapse next to her and leave her on her stomach cuffed for close to 30 minutes while we both recover on the bed.  We shower, I enjoy nibbling and biting on her tits and nipples, and we go to bed. She slept with her head on my chest, hand on my cock, and legs wrapped around mine the entire night. I wake her up the next morning, and receive a mind-blowing, sexy, and slow bj.  I have to sneak out because the kids would be up “anytime now”.

Apparently I had fucked a friend of Amy’s. She told her that I was “a good dom if asked”.  That helped me out a lot because I would have never hit on a classmate for fear the entire school would know.  This relationship lasted until winter break when I went and got myself a girlfriend, because I’m an idiot.

9p6rsy,5,2018-10-18,Secret life of Hamtaro Miuranger,Cinemus_Prime,berserkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/berserkers/comments/9p6rsy/secret_life_of_hamtaro_miuranger/,"I'm really scared now, guys. I think Miura's finally lost it. He stopped working on berserk altogether. Now he just draws increasingly gruesome catboi porn which he forces me to read before burning it all one page at a time. I ask him why. He tells me it's already reached it's audience.

Last night Miura discovered alcohol for the very first time in his entire life. I told him not to drink so much, that it would only make him sick, especially since it was his first time, but he told me I didn't know jack shit and that I could go watch furry porn on my new phone for all he cared.

I tried to talk the intern Miura had chained to the radiator into helping out, but he's been awfully quiet for the last couple days and he didn't break that pattern today.

And so all I could do was stand by and watch Miura poison himself before my very eyes. It broke my heart to watch him like this, but nothing would convince him to stop, not even my tears. If anything, that seemed to provoke him to throw the empty bottles at me. One of them missed and smashed against the radiator, showering broken glass all over the poor intern.

He didn't shout or even react, but still I had to check on him, so I rushed over. What shocked me was just how much glass had dug into his skin. But still he didn't have any sort of reaction.

Miura told me to leave him. I told him to give me the key. He threw another bottle, this time not even half empty. It smashed against the radiator, and... well alcohol and heat don't mix well. I was raised since birth to be Miura's sex slave boy, and even I know that much chemistry.

I dragged the catatonic intern as far away from the fires as the chains would allow and begged Miura for the key. His eyes only went wide with terror as he watched the fire spread. I quickly realized I would never get through to him and rushed to the bedroom to grab the blankets off the floor. If I couldn't get the intern away from the fire, all I could hope to do was smother it.

But halfway there, Miura grabbed me by the bell collar around my neck and pulled me in close to explain exactly what would happen if I burned his bedding. I explained what would happen if I didn't and rammed my knee into his tiny impotent dick before running back to the office where the fires had almost reached the intern.

I threw the blankets onto the fire, patting them down all over to smother the flames and stop it from spreading any further. It took a long time and when I was done, my hands were almost as badly burnt as the bedding.

The intern looked at me with those same empty eyes. But at least he was looking at me instead of the empty air. I smiled a little, and asked if he was alright. He looked above me, and suddenly I felt my throat collapse as Miura grabbed my collar from behind, pulling me up to eye level with a strength I never expected from him.

His eyes bore into mine and he asked me to repeat what he said he would do if I ruined his blankets. I did... and he did.

Now I'm stuck in yet another broom closet stripped of the clothes I had only just been allowed to wear again, and robbed of the phone I was given by Uncle Buronson.

Luckily, I knew that glimpse of freedom wouldn't last and kept the intern's phone up my ass the whole time for just such an occasion. I've already texted Uncle Buronson to tell him everything that happened. Now I'm just waiting for him to come save us while I share this story with the you guys.

I'm not a religious person. Theology was never part of my training. Still though, if you can, I'd appreciate it if you prayed for me, and the Intern, and especially Miura. I don't know what's happening to him, but I do know this much: he's the one who needs help more than any of us.

Please, Uncle Buronson, come quickly."
9p6tww,0,2018-10-18,My [22F] girlfriend doesn't seem over her ex,astrongbabyweakadult,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9p6tww/my_22f_girlfriend_doesnt_seem_over_her_ex/,"I've \[24M\] recently started dating (3 weeks) a girl and the conversation of ex's came up. She has recently moved countries (2 months ago) and thus broke up with her boyfriend (according to her his internship was ending soon too so he was also moving away eventually) before moving, so their relationship didn't sour but more it was forced to end because of the move.

When I was being told this I couldn't help but feel sort of sad as if I wasn't the only guy on her mind but I understand that she cant just forget about someone she cared about in such a short time. I asked her a few direct questions such as, do you think about him when we hang out or have sex / still text him (she says not much anymore) and she replied no (but admitted to thinking about him on previous dates with other guys) and that she doesn't want to end things with me.

The thing that bothers me is, if this guy suddenly appeared in this city, I'm fairly certain they would just get back together or she would start considering it - her reply to this was that he won't appear here that its a silly scenario i created.

Do you think I'm being irrational? I'm not a jealous type of person at all but I do like to think that the person I'm with only has me on their mind romantically at least.

Do you think it's reasonable to want break things off?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** New girlfriend moved countries for a job and had to break up with a guy she was dating. She doesn't seem over him which is understandable because the relationship didn't end in a sour way. Not sure if  I'm being irrational  on wanting to break things off because I feel like I'm not the only person on someones mind romantically.

9p7fw2,13,2018-10-18,Financial Abuse and Special Needs,TitanicBead,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/9p7fw2/financial_abuse_and_special_needs/,"So, the school isn't really doing enough in the 3 hours they have with my son (speech delay) and he's not making enough progress. Last year, he did very well but now he has all new teachers, teacher assistants, and specialists that have done fuck all. This is the best school in the immediate area, so they see a lot of people coming in and out to do internships, looking for job experience, etc. Nothing is really constant.

Private speech therapy will cost $500 per week, and the only way to go about that is to get him an ASD diagnosis. The school isn't willing to dx him with it since he doesn't have many of the traits, but the specialists we pay out of pocket are willing because my half-nephews have a diagnosis and a metric shit ton of developmental delays. Plus, since we're poor it's the only way we can afford therapy. It's a wink-wink nudge-nudge situation, and they don't think it'll hurt anything either way.

However, he's thriving at his school besides speech and his teachers will certainly treat him different/badly. Last year he had a friend with (mild) ASD, and he was introduced as ""Sam with Autism"" and the teachers acted as if he wasn't all there mentally, even though he was pretty much just like every other kid and intelligent, but quiet and shy.  My son just made another friend and was invited to her birthday party (and she specifically asked for him to come, excluded some other kids) and I'm worried about the social impact. He has no repetitive behaviors, restricted/obsessive interests, no need for structure or routine and socializes appropriately. He's very affectionate and empathetic, gifted intellectually, but still has lingering issues with speech.

I was told we can always get the diagnosis taken away later, but it still worries me. My nephews (another district in a different state) are bullied mercilessly and they have been in a self-contained special ed class since day one. I'd opt for homeschooling but I have a chronic illness and financially speaking, I need to go back to work in a few years too.

I feel like I'm failing my kid no matter what I do. My husband is acting like an idiot so I'm going to have to look up his IEP and try to figure out changes we can make/requests/etc, and try not to get screwed over. To make things worse, my husband stole my debit card and drained all of my savings ($5,000) to spend on random shit. He has a history of doing this, but the previous time he did it was about eight years ago and we have been together for about 16-17 years total. His mother is similar, and has stolen his identity and ruined his credit (and yes, it was definitely her.)  I thought he was over it. We discussed divorce, and I seriously considered it and terminating his parental rights because he's a deadbeat parent as well... but, that would mean moving back to my impoverished hometown with my abusive and drug-addicted family. As you can imagine, all the schools there are failing, and even in the nicer parts it is dangerous to drive to the store due to random gunfire, fighting, drugs, etc. 

So, now I need to find a way to acquire and save money again. I'm going to try to force husband into therapy, which he's willing to do, but I'm so tired. I can't imagine a therapist not telling him he's a piece of shit either. When I had PPD, my psychiatrist called him a ""fucking idiot"" on accident. He refuses to parent without prompting or do chores (mow the lawn while I watch the kids, help me fix something, buy groceries on his way home from work, etc) unless I start having a nervous breakdown. My sister suggested that I simply just handle the finances on top of everything else, but in that case he would do absolutely nothing except go to work, come home and play video games. My anxiety is so severe I'm barely functioning and I've lost weight.

I don't really know what to do but continue to push through school and try to get some sort of independence, so I can bail if need be. My husband searches through my purse, is there I way I can make some kind of account he doesn't know about and start putting away money? 

My father is not well and I'm due to inherit a significant amount of money when he passes, and I am certain that my husband will try to take it and blow it when he gets anxious again. I need to keep that safe."
9p7pce,237,2018-10-18,Wohnungsmarkt München,RainbowRay33,de,https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/9p7pce/wohnungsmarkt_münchen/,"Hallo zusammen,

&amp;#x200B;

ich arbeite selbst in der Immobilienbranche (Gewerbe und Einzelhandel) und meine Familie hat seit den 60er Jahren ingesamt 67 Wohnungen in München, verteilt auf 2 Objekte. Wir haben derzeit keine Belastungen auf den Immobilien und somit auch keine Verbindlichkeiten gegenüber Banken weshalb wir nach wie vor günstige Mieten anbieten können. Ein Objekt ist in Innenstadtlage am Gärtnerplatz und hier habe ich vorerst intern im Haus versucht eine frei werdende Wohnung zu vermieten. In der Regel funktioniert das auch immer weswegen ich mir den Stress bei Immoscout nicht geben muss.

&amp;#x200B;

Diesmal haben mir tatsächlich alle Leute von der Warteliste sowie auch bereits bestehende Bestandsmieter/WG's abgesagt. Also habe ich mich hingesetzt und ein ansprechendes Exposee erstellt und zum Preis von 14,60 € kalt eingestellt.

Die Anzeige ist nun mittlerweile 24 Stunden Online und ich habe sage und Schreibe über 300 Anfragen bekommen. Klar ist der Preis und die Lage super aber WAS ZUM FICK?!

Ich weiß das der Markt einfach abgefuckt ist aber das es so schlimm ist hätte ich wirklich nicht vermutet. Unsere Stadt-, Landes- und Bundespolitik hat hier so heftig versagt und das Thema bewusst ignoriert das es nun völlig eskaliert ist.

&amp;#x200B;

Ich bekomme ständig Bestechungen angeboten nur damit die Leute eine Wohnung finden. Achja von den über 300 Anfragen arbeiten ca. 10% bei BMW. Wäre mal gut wenn der Autobauer entsprechend mehr Wohnungen für seine Mitarbeiter kauft, Kohle haben die ja eh genug.

Ca 20% schreiben mir weil Sie wegen Eigenbedarf gekündigt wurden - Vielen Dank für so einen umfassenden Mieterschutz lieber Gesetzgeber. Habt Ihr ja super hinbekommen und Frau Barley soll jetzt nach Brüssel wechseln? Sie war grademal 1 Jahr dran da etwas zu verändern?

Sonst sind viele Paare dabei und paar Alleinstehende. Ich werd die Wohnung jetzt aber nicht dem 0815 McKinsey / Rechtsanwalt o.Ä. vermieten. Die finden eh was. Ich werde wohl ein Paar reinlassen die eben nicht reich sind und noch am Anfang Ihrer Berufskarriere stehen.

&amp;#x200B;

Ich bin aber echt nach wie vor schockiert wie verzwickt die Situation mittlerweile ist.

Ein kleiner Appell an Euch. Wenn Ihr Euch auf Wohnungen ins solchen Städten bewerbt, seid bitte nicht böse auf den Eigentümer wenn er Euch nicht antwortet. Man wird wirklich regelrecht überflutet mit Anfragen und ich hab nebenher ne junge Familie und arbeite in nem regulären Job.

&amp;#x200B;

Vielleicht möchtet Ihr ja ein paar Eurer Erfahrungen loswerden und bisschen Frusttherapie betreiben. Ich will Euch damit auch nur aufzeigen das der Aufwand der durch sowas bei mir entsteht enorm ist und ich offengestanden nie eine 100% objektive Entscheidung treffen kann/werde. Und ja es wäre einfacher mit Makler, aber der steht genau vor demselben Problem und wird die Wohnung eh an nen Bekannten weiterverschachern und dann darf ich dafür auch noch Kohle lockermachen. Nein Danke

&amp;#x200B;

Ray

Edit: Hört mal auf mir Bestechungsangebote per PN zu schicken Ihr Wahsninnigen :)"

I I have recently given my GRE and TOEFL. I am having doubts regarding my future career and I need help from someone who can evaluate my profile and my research and give me some suggestion as to 'where to' next. 

**Profile for fall 2019:**

Nationality: Indian

GRE: 322 (167Q, 155V)

TOEFL: 102-110 expected

GPA: 7.79/10 Bachelors in Computer Engineering

Work Experience: 15 months as Software Developer working in an Investment Bank as a consultant as of today. Worked on multiple java projects with spring framework. 

Research Paper: 1 written perfunctorily as a part of final year project in bachelors.

Letter of Recommendation: Can provide 2 academic and 2 professional LOR.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to pursue **Masters in Computer Science from USA with specialization in ML**.

&amp;#x200B;

**I understand that I don't have enough research nor the gpa to get me in tier 1 universities** and there must be a university applying beyond which will probably be futile for me. Something like University of California San Diego (the best I can get). 

&amp;#x200B;

**I want to get my degree from the  best university I can get with the above profile that will enhance my professional value and get me a job in the best of tech based companies out there.**

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: 

1) Can you do preliminary evaluation for my profile and provide me a list of universities? (My list in decreasing order of likelihood of getting an admit IMO: Stony Brook University, University of California Irvine, Georgia Tech, University of California San Diego, University of California Los Angeles)

2) Do you think it will make sense to get more work experience and apply next year that will increase my chances of landing an internship and job in tier 1 tech companies?

3) Based on my research and asking around- No offence to Stony Brook, but if I apply from Stony Brook and UCLA for an internship/job in Google, I have same chances of landing a job(based on my skill set). Is this true?

4) Will going  to Stony Brook give me a chance of applying for an internship and job in all the companies or will there be certain restrictions?

5)My inclination towards Stony Brook is due to its lesser cost of education. Is there any downside to this? Will my chances of landing a job in any Silicon Valley company be reduced?

6) I understand that I have quixotic goals of landing a job at Google or Facebook. I only want to understand if I will get a call from them after viewing my resume. Whatever happens after that depends entirely on me and my skill set but will it matter the university I apply it from?

7) Will it matter If I apply for fall 2020 instead of fall 2019 and in the meanwhile try to do an independent project, some social service and independent courses(iTunes University or edx or coursera) to get a grasp of what I am getting into?

8) Will my increased work experience of 1 year increase my likelihood or getting into a better university and a job at Facebook?

9)Can you tell me the best universities I can get in in fall 2019 with that profile?

10) Can you tell me the best universities I can get in in fall 2020 with the below profile:

\- GRE: 170Q, 160V (retake gre)

\- TOEFL: 102-110 expected

\- GPA: 7.79/10 Bachelors in Computer Engineering

\- Work Experience: 27 months as Software Developer working in an Investment Bank as a consultant when I apply.

\- Independent project on Machine Learning.

\- More business problem solving knowledge with additional work experience.

\- Independent MOOC courses.

Please help and guide. Thanks."

So a ""little"" more detailed explanation; I broke up with my girlfriend about a week or two ago because it just wasn't working, I could not see a future with her. We were each others first REAL relationship, sure we both had other relationships, but neither of us went above 3rd base with our ""exes"". Anyways, the reason the relationship didn't work was because of many reasons: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) She was ""too nice"" to everyone, she never stood up for herself or me, and it got to a point where she was trying to please everyone except me.

2) She never admitted her mistakes even though it was obvious; she never apologized unless I beg her to, and, 

3) She LOVED arguing. My family background isn't so great, I live at home with my parents and one sister, and no one gets along for more than an hour, there's never peace at home. I grew up in a very dysfunctional and mentally abusive family, thus, peace is an essential characteristic I look for in a relationship, which this didn't have. 

&amp;#x200B;

We'd been dating for two and a half years with a lot of ups and downs; it was going great throughout the first year and a half until I found out that she wasn't loyal at the beginning of the relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, there was this guy, this fling of hers who in my point of view kept messaging and harassing her (she didn't feel harassed and still tried being friends with him until I said that I wasn't comfortable with it). He kept asking to meet her and instead of her saying no, she would be like ""sorry I cannot right now, I'm busy, maybe next time."" Her response would hurt me because he wasn't the only guy interested in banging her, she's a gorgeous woman who had her fair share of looks from every other guy. I never spoke my heart because I'm not as secure as I'd like to be about my self, and I didn't want to show that to her. Eventually, she'd say this to every guy, and I told her that it made me uncomfortable, justified it as being kind to these guys and then it didn't happen AS OFTEN as it did before, which I still appreciated. Flash forward a year and a half into the relationship this guy messages her again, and we were in a perfect place at that point of time, we both were really happy in general and times were good. So I started fucking around with the guy using her phone, trying to bait him and play a prank on him, I sent him on a 4-hour drive ""for a good time"" and it was funny, we laughed it off although she felt bad for the guy and I didn't understand why. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) The guy was a jerk, only interested in flinging with her.

2) He said disgusting shit like ""he's your boyfriend, not your husband, so its fine to cheat on him.""

3) He asked her for nudes - TO WHICH SHE GAVE A VERY POLITE ANSWER - NOT DECLINING - NOT GIVING - INSTEAD OF BLOCKING THIS FUCK WIT. (Beginning of the relationship, say first 3 months?). After I told her what the fuck I don't like this, she blocked him.

&amp;#x200B;

I understood that she was the kind of person who wants to please everyone and I accepted it. Anyways, we had access to each other's phones since it was a very open and trustworthy relationship, I used the WhatsApp web feature after he messaged to talk and lure him, she was obviously with me then. After the whole thing finished, I wondered why she felt bad to give this jackass what he deserves, I've read all her chats before, vice versa, and from my point of view it only looked like he was harassing her. So I went back on WhatsApp web to read the chat again to figure out why could she feel bad for him, everything was one way right? Wrong, upon looking at the history, THINGS SHE HAD DELETED FROM THE START OF THE RELATIONSHIP RECOVERED AND APPEARED THERE, she was as much as a party as he was, and this gutted me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read the chats from the start again and again because I couldn't believe my eyes, it was shit like ""We'll meet after my college ends"" ""I'm horny are you free right now"" ""I prefer doing stuff in the car"" blah blah blah, it hurts even to type this now. I called her right away this was 7 AM, I stayed up all night reading the chats again and again and then moved on to other chats to find possible similarities, there was a lot of flirting with other guys but nothing as serious. I told her what I found and broke up with her straight up, she was sleepy and confused and was trying to calm me down. She then proceeded to come over and calm me down and explain things, and this is what made it worse, ""I don't remember what happened it doesn't sound like me"". She apologized, she said she might have been in a bad place blah blah and how I made her a better person, and she doesn't want to lose me. It wasn't enough for me, I told her that it's over, but she was persistent over the days to follow and eventually we got back together. Again, then what followed was more fucked up, she started acting like the victim whenever I tried to talk to her about it to console myself. All I wanted to hear was ""I'm sorry; I did attempt to cheat on you"" (She said nothing happened after the relationship, only a month before the relationship begun). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways more fights about that, back and forth then we were okay then we were not, and it's not been stable for the year the followed that. There was also another huge incident which was her fault (This happened before all of the above happened) which of course she didn't apologize until it was too late. In the final year, stuff was good sometimes, stuff was horrible other times, and I started feeling like it was more bad than good. Finally, a tiny fight where again she didn't admit her mistake and didn't apologize ticked me off and I went to her and broke it off face to face 100% serious. I ""broke up"" with her multiple times after the WhatsApp incident but it never lasted, this one will. Now what the problem is that she ""doesn't want to lose me"", she still has deep feelings for me, but I lost a good chunk of my feelings in the past two-three months. She tried getting me back into the relationship again but I know it's just going to end up back here, so better late than never. Also, she still doesn't think that the last fight which ticked me off was her fault, which it clearly was. I know when I'm wrong I do apologize whenever I feel like I've made a mistake. The breakup is now finally mutual because I helped her realize that this would never work, she's always wanted a Romeo which is far opposite of what I am. Our core principles are also very different; I'm really practical when it comes to everything, money, relationships, and my career. She's more like ""live for now"", cabs everywhere, fancy restaurants, fuck saving money. Which I do respect but it's obviously not a compatible relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

She said if not a relationship, she doesn't want to lose me as a friend, to which I agree, but I know that it's not healthy. I am still attracted to her, sexually and emotionally. I would hate to see her with other guys and I won't be able to move on. Funny story, we went to a bar after the breakup ""as friends"" with her group of friends, and a truth or dare question was ""What do you regret the most"", she said ""Including my mom so much into my life"" (Brown parents, curfews and stuff) which is fine, it kind of hurt that it wasn't fucking this relationship over but no problem. Few questions later ""What have you done to someone who didn't deserve it"".. Answer? Sent an ex-fling far away. Boom, I'm fuming, I didn't create a scene but I casually got the fuck out of there. REALLY? IT WASN'T CHEATING/ALMOST CHEATING/BETRAYING ME?...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, she actually apologized for that, surprising.. We met a couple of times after that as friends and it was okay, kind of fun. I do want to stay as friends a little bit because I lost all my friends when I started dating, it was my fault because I neglected them, honestly, they weren't ""FRIENDS"" more like a hang-out group, so no regrets there. I'm yet to find a best friend I can really hit it off with. I'm not social and lean toward the introverted side. I'm lonely, and I have nowhere else to turn, work is full of people much older to me (I'm a full-time intern 9:00-6:30), college (I attend once a week, sometimes..) is full of fuckwits who aren't ambitious and only want to party 24 7.

&amp;#x200B;

This is more of a rant thread than seeking advice, but advice would really be appreciated. What do I do regarding her? Should I cut all ties? I remember things sometimes, and it drives me nuts! I honestly just want to say fuck it, cut all ties with everyone, go to the gym, get the magic body (I'm a little healthy, probably a big factor of my insecurity) (I'm lazy AFFF). Save up for braces to fix my fuckall teeth which my fucking parents are busy neglecting because ""we can't afford it"", even though the latest gadgets and useless waste of money things are okay. My sister, 30 years old still fucking feeds off my parents, and she is a waste of life, I might sound like a complete fucking tool but I can assure you that I have nothing but hate in my heart for her. A completely different story, won't fall into that, but let's just say that if she, the major source of hatred in the house, wasn't in the picture, I might have had a functional family, she drives both my parents crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to forget my upbringing, my past, be the most confident person I can, and I then think everything will fall into place. What do you guys think?

3. She  LOVED arguing. My family background isn't so great, I live at home with  my parents and one sister, and no one gets along for more than an hour,  there's never peace at home. I grew up in a very dysfunctional and  mentally abusive family, thus, peace is an essential characteristic I  look for in a relationship, which this didn't have.

We'd  been dating for two and a half years with a lot of ups and downs; it  was going great throughout the first year and a half until I found out  that she wasn't loyal at the beginning of the relationship.

So,  there was this guy, this fling of hers who in my point of view kept  messaging and harassing her (she didn't feel harassed and still tried  being friends with him until I said that I wasn't comfortable with it).  He kept asking to meet her and instead of her saying no, she would be  like ""sorry I cannot right now, I'm busy, maybe next time."" Her response  would hurt me because he wasn't the only guy interested in banging her,  she's a gorgeous woman who had her fair share of looks from every other  guy. I never spoke my heart because I'm not as secure as I'd like to be  about my self, and I didn't want to show that to her. Eventually, she'd  say this to every guy, and I told her that it made me uncomfortable,  justified it as being kind to these guys and then it didn't happen AS  OFTEN as it did before, which I still appreciated. Flash forward a year  and a half into the relationship this guy messages her again, and we  were in a perfect place at that point of time, we both were really happy  in general and times were good. So I started fucking around with the  guy using her phone, trying to bait him and play a prank on him, I sent  him on a 4-hour drive ""for a good time"" and it was funny, we laughed it  off although she felt bad for the guy and I didn't understand why.

1. The guy was a jerk, only interested in flinging with her.
2. He said disgusting shit like ""he's your boyfriend, not your husband, so its fine to cheat on him.""
3. He  asked her for nudes - TO WHICH SHE GAVE A VERY POLITE ANSWER - NOT  DECLINING - NOT GIVING - INSTEAD OF BLOCKING THIS FUCK WIT. (Beginning  of the relationship, say first 3 months?). After I told her what the  fuck I don't like this, she blocked him.

I  understood that she was the kind of person who wants to please everyone  and I accepted it. Anyways, we had access to each other's phones since  it was a very open and trustworthy relationship, I used the WhatsApp web  feature after he messaged to talk and lure him, she was obviously with  me then. After the whole thing finished, I wondered why she felt bad to  give this jackass what he deserves, I've read all her chats before, vice  versa, and from my point of view it only looked like he was harassing  her. So I went back on WhatsApp web to read the chat again to figure out  why could she feel bad for him, everything was one way right? Wrong,  upon looking at the history, THINGS SHE HAD DELETED FROM THE START OF  THE RELATIONSHIP RECOVERED AND APPEARED THERE, she was as much as a  party as he was, and this gutted me.

I  read the chats from the start again and again because I couldn't  believe my eyes, it was shit like ""We'll meet after my college ends""  ""I'm horny are you free right now"" ""I prefer doing stuff in the car""  blah blah blah, it hurts even to type this now. I called her right away  this was 7 AM, I stayed up all night reading the chats again and again  and then moved on to other chats to find possible similarities, there  was a lot of flirting with other guys but nothing as serious. I told her  what I found and broke up with her straight up, she was sleepy and  confused and was trying to calm me down. She then proceeded to come over  and calm me down and explain things, and this is what made it worse, ""I  don't remember what happened it doesn't sound like me"". She apologized,  she said she might have been in a bad place blah blah and how I made  her a better person, and she doesn't want to lose me. It wasn't enough  for me, I told her that it's over, but she was persistent over the days  to follow and eventually we got back together. Again, then what followed  was more fucked up, she started acting like the victim whenever I tried  to talk to her about it to console myself. All I wanted to hear was  ""I'm sorry; I did attempt to cheat on you"" (She said nothing happened  after the relationship, only a month before the relationship begun).

Anyways  more fights about that, back and forth then we were okay then we were  not, and it's not been stable for the year the followed that. There was  also another huge incident which was her fault (This happened before all  of the above happened) which of course she didn't apologize until it  was too late. In the final year, stuff was good sometimes, stuff was  horrible other times, and I started feeling like it was more bad than  good. Finally, a tiny fight where again she didn't admit her mistake and  didn't apologize ticked me off and I went to her and broke it off face  to face 100% serious. I ""broke up"" with her multiple times after the  WhatsApp incident but it never lasted, this one will. Now what the  problem is that she ""doesn't want to lose me"", she still has deep  feelings for me, but I lost a good chunk of my feelings in the past  two-three months. She tried getting me back into the relationship again  but I know it's just going to end up back here, so better late than  never. Also, she still doesn't think that the last fight which ticked me  off was her fault, which it clearly was. I know when I'm wrong I do  apologize whenever I feel like I've made a mistake. The breakup is now  finally mutual because I helped her realize that this would never work,  she's always wanted a Romeo which is far opposite of what I am. Our core  principles are also very different; I'm really practical when it comes  to everything, money, relationships, and my career. She's more like  ""live for now"", cabs everywhere, fancy restaurants, fuck saving money.  Which I do respect but it's obviously not a compatible relationship.

She  said if not a relationship, she doesn't want to lose me as a friend, to  which I agree, but I know that it's not healthy. I am still attracted  to her, sexually and emotionally. I would hate to see her with other  guys and I won't be able to move on. Funny story, we went to a bar after  the breakup ""as friends"" with her group of friends, and a truth or dare  question was ""What do you regret the most"", she said ""Including my mom  so much into my life"" (Brown parents, curfews and stuff) which is fine,  it kind of hurt that it wasn't fucking this relationship over but no  problem. Few questions later ""What have you done to someone who didn't  deserve it"".. Answer? Sent an ex-fling far away. Boom, I'm fuming, I  didn't create a scene but I casually got the fuck out of there. REALLY?  IT WASN'T CHEATING/ALMOST CHEATING/BETRAYING ME?...

Anyways,  she actually apologized for that, surprising.. We met a couple of times  after that as friends and it was okay, kind of fun. I do want to stay  as friends a little bit because I lost all my friends when I started  dating, it was my fault because I neglected them, honestly, they weren't  ""FRIENDS"" more like a hang-out group, so no regrets there. I'm yet to  find a best friend I can really hit it off with. I'm not social and lean  toward the introverted side. I'm lonely, and I have nowhere else to  turn, work is full of people much older to me (I'm a full-time intern  9:00-6:30), college (I attend once a week, sometimes..) is full of  fuckwits who aren't ambitious and only want to party 24 7.

This  is more of a rant thread than seeking advice, but advice would really  be appreciated. What do I do regarding her? Should I cut all ties? I  remember things sometimes, and it drives me nuts! I honestly just want  to say fuck it, cut all ties with everyone, go to the gym, get the magic  body (I'm a little healthy, probably a big factor of my insecurity)  (I'm lazy AFFF). Save up for braces to fix my fuckall teeth which my  fucking parents are busy neglecting because ""we can't afford it"", even  though the latest gadgets and useless waste of money things are okay. My  sister, 30 years old still fucking feeds off my parents, and she is a  waste of life, I might sound like a complete fucking tool but I can  assure you that I have nothing but hate in my heart for her. A  completely different story, won't fall into that, but let's just say  that if she, the major source of hatred in the house, wasn't in the  picture, I might have had a functional family, she drives both my  parents crazy.

I  just want to forget my upbringing, my past, be the most confident  person I can, and I then think everything will fall into place. What do  you guys think?"

However, I didn't want my 3 years of studies to go to waste, so I decided I will try to get an internship to see if I can get some experience on my resume and possibly actually like accounting in the real world. I ended up getting an internship at a big engineering company for an AR role, which was boring but very laidback. After I had a big company on my resume, I decided, ok, lets see if I can make the most out of my degree and see if I can get a full time job at a big company, and if I don't, I'll just apply for computer science programs and do an undergraduate degree. Fast forward a year later, I'm in big 4 audit, mind you I'm in private, so the hours aren't suicidal but it still wont be great at year-end. I've finished my cpa modules, have the capstones and cfe next year, and then if I pass and stay 2 years Ill probably be a cpa. I know I sound ungrateful for where I am, but, in 2.5 years I don't want to come out of the firm looking for these comp sci jobs and being rejected because I don't have an STEM degree. What can I do in the mean time to increase the likelihood of landing a comp sci position or even getting into a masters program so that I can land that position without doing an undergrad?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Got into big 4 audit with no interest in accounting and want to go into comp sci. How can I do it without either getting an undergrad after my cpa or dropping big 4 and getting an undergrad now?"

Hey guys and girls,

So  a ""little"" more detailed explanation; I broke up with my girlfriend  about a week or two ago because it just wasn't working, I could not see a  future with her. We were each others first REAL relationship, sure we  both had other relationships, but neither of us went above 3rd base with  our ""exes"". Anyways, the reason the relationship didn't work was  because of many reasons:

1. She  was ""too nice"" to everyone, she never stood up for herself or me, and  it got to a point where she was trying to please everyone except me.
2. She never admitted her mistakes even though it was obvious; she never apologized unless I beg her to, and,
3. She  LOVED arguing. My family background isn't so great, I live at home with  my parents and one sister, and no one gets along for more than an hour,  there's never peace at home. I grew up in a very dysfunctional and  mentally abusive family, thus, peace is an essential characteristic I  look for in a relationship, which this didn't have.

We'd  been dating for two and a half years with a lot of ups and downs; it  was going great throughout the first year and a half until I found out  that she wasn't loyal at the beginning of the relationship.

So,  there was this guy, this fling of hers who in my point of view kept  messaging and harassing her (she didn't feel harassed and still tried  being friends with him until I said that I wasn't comfortable with it).  He kept asking to meet her and instead of her saying no, she would be  like ""sorry I cannot right now, I'm busy, maybe next time."" Her response  would hurt me because he wasn't the only guy interested in banging her,  she's a gorgeous woman who had her fair share of looks from every other  guy. I never spoke my heart because I'm not as secure as I'd like to be  about my self, and I didn't want to show that to her. Eventually, she'd  say this to every guy, and I told her that it made me uncomfortable,  justified it as being kind to these guys and then it didn't happen AS  OFTEN as it did before, which I still appreciated. Flash forward a year  and a half into the relationship this guy messages her again, and we  were in a perfect place at that point of time, we both were really happy  in general and times were good. So I started fucking around with the  guy using her phone, trying to bait him and play a prank on him, I sent  him on a 4-hour drive ""for a good time"" and it was funny, we laughed it  off although she felt bad for the guy and I didn't understand why.

1. The guy was a jerk, only interested in flinging with her.
2. He said disgusting shit like ""he's your boyfriend, not your husband, so its fine to cheat on him.""
3. He  asked her for nudes - TO WHICH SHE GAVE A VERY POLITE ANSWER - NOT  DECLINING - NOT GIVING - INSTEAD OF BLOCKING THIS FUCK WIT. (Beginning  of the relationship, say first 3 months?). After I told her what the  fuck I don't like this, she blocked him.

I  understood that she was the kind of person who wants to please everyone  and I accepted it. Anyways, we had access to each other's phones since  it was a very open and trustworthy relationship, I used the WhatsApp web  feature after he messaged to talk and lure him, she was obviously with  me then. After the whole thing finished, I wondered why she felt bad to  give this jackass what he deserves, I've read all her chats before, vice  versa, and from my point of view it only looked like he was harassing  her. So I went back on WhatsApp web to read the chat again to figure out  why could she feel bad for him, everything was one way right? Wrong,  upon looking at the history, THINGS SHE HAD DELETED FROM THE START OF  THE RELATIONSHIP RECOVERED AND APPEARED THERE, she was as much as a  party as he was, and this gutted me.

I  read the chats from the start again and again because I couldn't  believe my eyes, it was shit like ""We'll meet after my college ends""  ""I'm horny are you free right now"" ""I prefer doing stuff in the car""  blah blah blah, it hurts even to type this now. I called her right away  this was 7 AM, I stayed up all night reading the chats again and again  and then moved on to other chats to find possible similarities, there  was a lot of flirting with other guys but nothing as serious.

I was kind of regretting sharing my story on  reddit, but it really does feel nice coming across replies like yours..  I tend to blame whatever fuckups happen in my life onto myself, because  who else is responsible? This has got my self-esteem really low and  these little happy replies kind of remind me that I am too hard on  myself. I've posted this on other subreds and would like to copy paste a  reply to give you a little more insight and seek more advice as it  seems you were once on this boat and things are much better for you now.

Honestly,   I may have been a little harsh in my rant, she really is a sweet  person  and would make a good friend, but scars don't heal so quick, I  do need  time to heal.

Like I mentioned  in another  comment, I'm a dumbwit when it comes to being social. I'm  not a very  confident person, right now I'm just looking for a friend, a  real friend  not an acquaintance who I can drink and party with and  forget about two  minutes later. I really haven't found anyone  throughout my life who  fits my definition of a friend. It is my fault  though, being an average  person, I've set my expectations so high that  in my point of view  nothing fits the bill. Although I know I should  lower it, I don't want  to.. I want to feel special for a change,  blessed with amazing friends.  Right now I can't think of anyone who  knows more about me than her and  I'm just hurting myself long term by  accepting her as my friend.

I really   don't want to message those ""friends"" again, because during the 2.5   years of the relationship, I learned what friends mean and those guys   were more or else just people I drank and had a good night with and   didn't give a fuck about the next day, vice versa. I really really   really have always just wanted a group of best friends like in   'friends', who know everything about me, vice versa and I really can't   find anyone at work or university who fits the bill. Obviously, they   aren't just gonna fall into my lap and I will have to put in effort, but   being asocial it's hard! She would honestly make a good friend because   we do know and still love each other knowing all our faults and I get   that it's almost impossible to be friends right now if every little   thing from the relationship would tick me off. I'm just trying to fill   this hole temporarily because I really am fed of up feeling lonely all   the time.

\_\_

 I really want to but it gets so fucking lonely! We would honestly make  great friends, but now that the physical aspect had been introduced,  there's no way to overlook that.

I've  read some ex-couple's who remain friends after the relationship, and it  works out well for them, how.. I never understood that, I would love to  be mature enough to let everything go and just be friends, IMO they're  probably exaggerating and such a thing does not exist.

It does, thanks for acknowledging it feels a little good.

I would really like to know what does her being so clingy and practically begging me to atleast stay friends with her mean? I mean if she cared so much she would right her wrongs, what I wanted from her was: 

1) Be stronger and independent, don't be afraid to say no.

2) Don't argue and justify so much over small things that are obvious, when it's my fault I immediately apologize, but she needs a whole day to understand that it was her fault.

3) Learn to apologize a little.

&amp;#x200B;

What she wanted from me?

1) Be more romantic, when she knew in the start of the relationship that this isn't me.

2) Not to escalate fights, I agree I escalated fights because she would just not understand that all she had to do was apologize for her mistake and not argue and justify every letter. 

3) Watch my temper, control my words. I agree, I'm foulmouthed, I say a lot of shit I don't mean, but again this falls into the escalation point, let's not start shit to get to that point? I've always been foulmouthed, I used to game a lot, gamers would relate. (I tried to control my mouth, but little things like ""dumbass"" ticked her off."

PART 1 - WCW MONDAY NITRO 09/18/1995-Before we can kick off any great Nitro action (or talk about Hulk Hogan, surprisingly), our ears are pierced by the sounds of loud ambulance sirens, and we're sent backstage, where Mean Gene is looking to interview, well, an ambulance. Or, you know, whoever's about to get out of it, my way is funnier though. Out comes Kevin Sullivan and The Giant, who seem to take glee over the whole issue of “I broke your \*\*\*\*ing neck, hahaha!” Giant and Gene also have a back and forth about how Giant's dad would feel about the whole situation, and I remind you, the backstory here is that Giant is the SON OF ANDRE THE GIANT!

1. WCW TAG TITLE MATCH: AMERICAN MALES VS HARLEM HEAT (W/SISTER SHERRI) (C.)This was actually supposed to be American Males vs The Blue Bloods – I'm sure I'll have more to say about the Blue Bloods in future episodes, but it's the team of Lord Steven Regal, better known to us as NXT GM William Regal, and Sir Robert, Earl of Eaton, former legendary Midnight Express member Bobby Eaton, with the gimmick of “British” despite being as Alabama as \*\*\*\* - but for reasons that make about as much sense as Booker T's WWE commentary, Harlem Heat (1) attack the Blue Bloods unprovoked; (2) offer to put their new WCW Tag titles on the line against the Males; (3) HOW DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE?!?!?! Before I get into the match itself, the American Males... Holy sh\*t, I don't know who thought that this would get over with a traditional Southern audience (especially the male portion), but here you got future eye-patch wearing Flock member Scotty Riggs, teaming with Marcus Alexander Bagwell, whom many of you might remember more from his later years when he becomes Buff Bagwell. And then probably none of you might remember him from that time he became (and I believe still is) a website mail order male prostitute. I wish that was a joke! They're a couple of decent athletic workers here, playing a Gawddamn Chippendales gimmick, because that's what male Southern rasslin fans have been clamoring for! Oh, and they have possibly the WORST entrance music (well, worst entrance music that is actually music) in the whole industry. Seriously, check this link out, it's okay, I'll wait for you.r/[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7awnRAdbPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7awnRAdbPk)It's so terrible and I LOVE IT! Most people remember it for the Devo-esque “American Males” refrain, but my favorite bit is the first verse, the part that sounds like it's a Trey Parker parody song on South Park, where the singer warns women “If they want to talk to you, you better not listen 'cuz you might wind up in critical condition”, which makes me wonder... are they \*\*\*\*ing women so hard that it sends them to the local medical facility? Because HOLY SH\*T if so! And yes, I would rather review terrible (but kinda awesome) WCW theme songs than this match, because while it's not a bad bout by any stretch, like most Harlem Heat matches for the first couple of years of Nitro's existence, this is more about the overbooked nonsense of a finishing sequence than anything else. After stuffing the hot tag comeback from Bagwell (who got to throw like 3 dropkicks as his entire hot tag spot), the ref gets distracted by Booker and Riggs fighting outside (because the antics of the illegal men in the match are more important than the match itself), Stevie holds Bagwell's arms to deliver a Tiger Suplex, and... Wait, sorry, that's wishful thinking on my part, he holds Bagwell's arms so Sherri can get up onto the apron and hit the future Buff with her shoe, but a randomly appearing Col. Rob Parker appears to snatch her from the apron, and carry her backstage. Stevie recovers from this lack of outside interference and instead attempts to Pumphandle Slam Bagwell, randomly loses control of his legs, and just falls over backwards for no reason, and Bagwell covers for the three count, giving us new WCW Tag champs and ending the epic one day reign of Harlem Heat. Holy sh\*t... So to summarize: (1) The tag titles are decided in what was essentially a one way jobber squash, that ended in favor of the team getting squashed; (2) featuring a ref distraction off of nothing illegal happening; (3) where the romance between an old timey plantation owner and the woman he had been sexually harassing factors into it; (4) and the finish is basically “Stevie gets so distracted by the sight of his manager being brought backstage to get laid that he forgot how both Pumphandle Slams and standing work”. Can you SEE why I didn't want to talk about this one? Brb, going to listen to the American Males theme another dozen times because that's preferable to a Harlem Heat match finish.-I'm pretty sure this is like the 3rd episode of Nitro I've covered where “Mean Gene interviews Ric Flair” is a thing (or maybe just 2nd episode?), and I have zero complaints about this. Of course, the night before, Pillman interfered in Flair's match with Arn Anderson, and the narrative being spun here is “Arn, you're a d\*ckbag because you brought in an interloper to interfere in Horseman business, woo!”, but that never seemed to be the case to me. It looked more like Pillman just interfered on his own volition because... reasons, so I dunno. But that's just me being nitpicky about an angle that I know goes to some stupid places by the end of it, the promo itself is fantastic, and Flair is the perfect amount of fired up and pissed off at what happened at Fall Brawl.
2. MR WONDERFUL PAUL ORNDORFF VS JOHNNY B. BADD: Well, talk about an interesting clash of styles and character arcs here. Badd is fresh off of a victory over Pillman the night before, which gives him a shot at Sting's US championship. Orndorff is fresh off of a match against no one on Sunday's card, and is going through a (sadly way too brief) career renaissance after a psychic who looks like a Q-Tip gave him a brief locker room self help session. See if you can guess which of these two men get protected by the finish! I know I've said it before, but holy sh\*t, Orndorff is so awesome here. He wrestles a very much WWF kicky punchy kind of style, but brings a surprising amount of snap and intensity to everything he does, enough so that it looks like 80's wrestling done on fast forward. Badd gets to shine with some great Cruiserweight offense as well, and you wouldn't think that this clash of styles would work so well, but it makes for a fun match. And then comes the very much “because modern day WWE booking strategy” finish to this WCW match, which sees Badd try to hit Orndorff with his own finish (the Piledriver), Orndorff try to reverse it into a back body drop, Badd countering THAT into a sunset flip, Orndorff almost going over, but then hooking the legs and getting the pinfall. WHELP! Sure, Badd has a title shot coming up, but I guess it's more important to make Mr Wonderful look strong? Because...?-BAHAHAHA! I forgot this was a thing! So some of the stars of WCW did a cameo on Baywatch at around this time, and we get footage of the time Kevin Sullivan tried to murder Randy Savage on set. Not a joke! Macho's doing bench presses on the beach when Sullivan walks up to him and tries to \*\*\*\*ing strangle him with the bar of the weights! When that doesn't work, he does the next most dangerous thing – THROWS SAND IN HIS EYES! - and punches him until Flair of all people makes the save. Would it be sh\*tty of me to make this the highlight of the night? This leads into Okerlund interviewing Savage about what happened, and Savage is so grateful to Flair for saving him from a Satanic midget that he basically tells Flair to \*\*\*\* off. WWE Babyface everyone! Wait, sorry... WCW Babyfaces everyone! He also suddenly spins the narrative of “LEX LUGER IS A SCUMBAG WHO TURNED ON ME AND CHEAP SHOTTED ME IN WAR GAMES!”, because he is an idiot manchild who doesn't understand the concept of “accidental physical contact”, and who ALSO thinks that STING is evil along WITH Luger. Hahaha, holy sh\*t! Luger makes his way out (as well he should), and blames Savage's jealousy on this whole conflict, and yeah, that makes sense, based on what we know of his relationship with Hogan in the WWF. This leads to Macho and Luger challenging each other to a match, which is going to take place on not tonight!-Because we need to kill more time before our main event, we get our SECOND hilariously awesome Dungeon of Doom related video package of the night, as well as a recap of the Hogan neck breaking at Fall Brawl. In the video, Hogan is sitting on his prized motorcycle (which was never seen prior to this, I believe), but that big, nasty, stinky Giant (and yes, “stinky Giant” is Hogan's go to insult for the guy!) shows up in a DUNGEON OF DOOM MONSTER TRUCK and RUNS OVER HOGAN'S MOTORCYCLE, laughing like a madman. Spoiler alert: this is ABSOLUTELY a vital part of the continuation of this angle, and holy sh\*t... You won't even believe how stupid this gets if you have never seen this era of WCW...
3. MAIN EVENT: FLYIN BRIAN PILLMAN VS RIC FLAIRIf you want to see something that feels absolutely out of place, but is also awesome as hell, get a load out of FIRED UP BABYFACE RIC FLAIR taking Pillman to the woodshed! Seriously, dude is seriously doing things you never see in a Flair match, like no selling a beating in the corner so he can reverse it and lay in some chops, using the patented “flip over the top turnbuckle” spot as a defensive maneuver, and perhaps weirdest of all, ACTUALLY LAND OFFENSE FROM THE TOP ROPE instead of getting grabbed by the d\*ck and thrown off. It's weird, and although the main event is way too short, it's fantastic while it lasts. Flair just locks in the Figure 4 out of nowhere and wins the match clean as a whistle, which for a Nitro main event match is a \*\*\*\*ing godsend really. Flair cuts a brief post-match promo basically telling Arn he's a dead man, and challenges him to a match next week. I can't remember if it's the match next week where it happens, or the week after, but spoiler alert: it leads to a cage match featuring the SADDEST CAGE OF ALL TIME! Well, maybe second saddest, that baby blue WWF cage with gaps between the bars so big that you could fit a full Sin Cara through them was pretty sad. We go off the show on a weird note, I don't know if Heenan was trying to get his sh\*t in and Eric no sold it or what, but out of nowhere Heenan chimes in with “Something's going on in the back!”, Bischoff replies with “Something IS going on in the back” and just continues with what he was saying, and the show ends. Weird!

PART 2 - WWE MONDAY NIGHT RAW 09/18/1995-If you ever wondered why people nowadays question Vince McMahon's ability to do commentary, the first 3 seconds of the show (after the intro) are him sh\*tting the bed and welcoming everyone to “a special Thursday episode of Raw”. That aired on a Monday. Holy sh\*t! I think that maybe this was pre-taped on a Thursday, but if so, way to kill your own kayfabe Vince! This would be the last time in history that Vince would kill kayfabe, ahem...

1. 1-2-3 KID VS RAZOR RAMONDespite the fact that Kid hasn't been a jobber for like one year+, they preface this match by showing old footage of that time Kid stopped being a jobber, got the upset victory over Ramon, and earned the name “1-2-3” (after going through a million other variations of “The \_\_\_\_\_ Kid”). We also get another brief recap video of Razor and Dean Douglas' confrontation at Summerslam, and I'm sure that won't factor into the match at all! Ahem! Despite my long running (well, long running in real life, not in article form) joke that Raw's mission statement from it's formation in 1993 until, like, early 1997 was to put on the most boring, kicky punchy chinlocky matches possible, the two Kliq members say “nuts to that” and give us an actual match, wrestled with a sense of urgency, great intensity, and in ring storytelling. Most of that intensity comes from Kid, with the story here being “1-2-3 Kid has a chip on his shoulder and something to prove, where Razor is both underestimating Kid and doesn't want to hurt his friend too badly”. It is absolutely the right story to tell, and anyone who remembers sh\*tting on Waltman and tossing out the term “Xpac Heat” REALLY needs to go back and rewatch these pre-Xpac matches and see how far ahead of most of his peers Kid was as an exciting, high flying worker. Oh, remember that Dean Douglas joke I made above? Well, you'll NEVER believe this, but after the ref gets taken out by a “ref bump” (which I put in quotes because he got grazed at best, and sold it by SAILING OUT TO THE FLOOR), GASP, Douglas runs interference! He delivers one splash to the back of Razor and then bails. This apparently KILLS RAZOR DEAD, because he doesn't move, both match participants who AREN'T doing racist Cuban impressions for a living recover, Kid slowly crawls over and lives up to the numbers in his name, getting the win. I'm sure Razor will be just as giving in putting over non-Kliq member Douglas at the PPV on Sunday! Ahem...RESULTS: 1-2-3 Kid def. Razor Ramon via pinfall-Speaking of Douglas, he buries both Kid and Razor AND puts himself over in the form of WRESTLING REPORT CARD! Fun stuff, as far as dead in the water midcard heel acts go.
2. TATANKA AND KAMA MUSTAFA (W/TED DIBIASE) VS SAVIO VEGA AND BOB “SPARK PLUG” HOLLYFor those of you behind on your Occupational Gimmicks, this is “Wrestling Indian”, “Wrestling MMA-ish Guy”, and “Wrestling Race Car Driver” all in one match. Most of these men are pretty much close to the versions of them you remember (at least in name), Kama Mustafa is the former Wrestling Voodoo Priest Papa Shango, and future Wrestling Pimp The Godfather. Man, dude made an entire career out of occupational gimmicks, didn't he? For being such a throwaway, meaningless tag team match, the action is surprisingly good whenever the faces are in control; Vega is almost like a Caribbean prototype Kevin Owens here, this chubby guy who decided “\*\*\*\* it, I'm going to do some high flying sh\*t”. Holly wrestles a more traditional style, very much akin to an early 90's Southern rasslin fired up, athletic babyface, which is surprisingly pretty dope. Whenever the heels are in charge? Eh, not so good. Don't get me wrong, they work the traditional tag team tropes of “build heat on the babyface by cutting him off from his corner until he makes the hot tag” paired with “the babyface on the apron (Holly here) keeps distracting the ref by trying to right injustices in the match and allows the heels to cheat”, that part's awesome, and I can't help but think of how much more I'd enjoy this match with better heels involved. Tatanka was never the greatest worker as a face, now that he's heel, it's basically babyface Tatanka but without the fired up comeback or offense that's designed to pop a crowd. Bleh. And while history will remember The Godfather as being a marginal worker at best, holy sh\*t, he's so green here that Kama makes The Godfather look like \*\*\*\*ing Kenta Kobashi by comparison. Dude is seriously working a martial artist gimmick and can't even convincingly KICK his opponents. Kama's greenness comes into play for the finish too, where after making the hot tag, Holly goes for a diving crossbody block, I THINK the idea is supposed to be that Kama catches him and powerslams him for the win. What happens is that he accidentally turns this into the laziest version possible of an All Japan finish, falling backwards, attempting to turn for the powerslam as he falls, and basically dropping Holly on his \*\*\*\*ing head. OOPS! He would be punished for such recklessness and/or accidentally bringing the Northern Lights Bomb to North America by enjoying many more years of employment, and being inducted into the Hall of Fame.RESULTS: Kama and Tatanka def. Bob “Spark Plug” Holly and Savio Vega via pinfall-Ramon comments on the whole Dean Douglas situation via faux-Scarface pre-recorded promo, and he threatens to murder Dean via carving him up.
3. JEAN PIERRE LAFITTE VS SOME JOBBERYes, I'm carrying over my modern wrestling review gag of referring to any non-notable enhancement talent as “some jobber”. As for LaFitte... Holy sh\*t, yet ANOTHER WWF character I almost don't want to explain because you'll think I'm lying, and he's in an even dumber angle to boot! LaFitte is Karl Ouellette, former Quebecers teammate of Jacques Rougeau, and legit pretty good for a big man wrestler who seriously only has one eye. Because of only having one working eye, Vince decided that it would be great to slap an eye patch on him, and give him the occupational gimmick of WRESTLING PIRATE! Right now, he's feuding with Bret Hart over – I swear I'm not making any of this up – the fact that he once came out during a Hitman match and stole the glasses that Hart gave to a kid, right off the kid's face, and then LATER stole Bret's jacket! This is seriously a reason for a wrestling feud! For reasons I can't even begin to fathom, this jobber manages to get in way more offense than he should, and while it's not much, dude looks like a total backyarder wrestling in a \*\*\*\*ing diaper, and the match should have been like 3 moves long. Instead, it's LaFitte taking way too long to beat this scrawny beanpole, and the legit best part of it all is Hart literally phoning in a brief chat with Vince and Jerry. Wrestling Pirate hits the Cannonball (a top rope Rolling Senton) for the win.RESULTS: Jean-Pierre LaFitte def. Some Jobber via pinfall-Before our main event, we get a brief video package for the main event at In Your House on Sunday (and yes, this is seriously a GO HOME SHOW), putting over the fact that one or more titles are guaranteed to change hands. Monsoon knows all about the importance of titles changing hands, after all, he once added sudden death overtime to the non-finish of a 60 minute Iron Man Match to ensure a new champion was crowned, ahem...
4. MAIN EVENT - WWF TAG NON-TITLE MATCH: MEN ON A MISSION (KING MABEL AND SIR MO) VS OWEN HART AND YOKOZUNA (W/JIM CORNETTE AND MR FUJI) (C.)Oh man... So torn on how I feel about sitting through this... One one hand, we got Yokozuna, who is still pretty dope for being way too fat, and Owen Hart, who is the absolute \*\*\*\*ing best. On the other hand, you got King Mabel, and the literal only good thing I have to say about that is “thank GAWD I don't have to review the pile of sh\*t that was King Of The Ring '95!” Mabel would of course go on to become Viscera, who started as a Satanic cultist, and then morphed into Sexual Chocolate 2.0. Sir Mo didn't do a whole lot of note outside of the WWF, but he did have runs with the USWA in Memphis both before AND after his WWF career, so there's that I guess. The match is actually fairly watchable whenever Mo is in the ring, whether it's with Owen OR Yoko, he's actually better than I remembered him being for a dumpy looking power wrestler. The nicest thing I'll say about moments involving Mabel is “Well, at least Owen made him look like a million bucks by bumping his ass off for him”, because see my above thing about Owen being the absolute \*\*\*\*ing best. It's heel team vs heel team here, with Owen playing the role of face in peril, so I guess that MOM are heelier than thou tonight? The crowd is surprisingly hot once Yokozuna gets tagged in to square off with Mabel, which tells me that this crowd absolutely does not give a sh\*t about good wrestling. Of course, Mo is the legal man in the match when this tag happens, so we're spared that showdown for the time being. That showdown happens after the commercial break, and it's AWESOME if you like immobile fat man combat. It doesn't last long (THANK GAWD), and the tag champs get the win after a tandem drop toe hold from Owen/leg drop to the back of the head from Yoko, while Cornette has the ref distracted.

&amp;#x200B;

RESULTS: Owen Hart and Yokozuna def. Mo and Mabel via pinfall-HBK and Diesel get a pre-recorded promo putting over their Triple Header match at the PPV, and it's Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash, of COURSE it's awesome. Say what you will about Nash as a worker, and Michaels as a backstage prima donna, but if there's anyone in the WWF circa '95 I want cutting promos, it's these two.-Speaking of guys I want to see cutting promos in 1995, our true main event is Jim Cornette talking! Say what you will about Corney and his grumpy old man take on modern wrestling, dude was one of the greatest managers of all time, it's a toss up between he and Heenan, and one of the best and most entertaining talkers of all time. Hell, he's STILL one of the most entertaining talkers of all time now, especially when he's discussing wrestling history. Or burying Trump and/or Russo! Corney does his best to put over the PPV main event (and while he doesn't have much to say, he is AWESOME at saying it), and Vince (who's conducting the interview) cuts him off to basically say “NO THAT'S NOT HAPPENING! THE KLIQ ARE THE BEST, \*\*\*\* YOU!”, and holy sh\*t... I thought that modern commentary babyfaces are biased! Actually, Corney does hit a very important talking point here: that HBK and Diesel HAD been partners before, and that ended with them fighting, whereas Owen and Yoko are a dedicated, loyal to each other tag team. This is absolutely the right narrative to tell here, as it plants that small seed of doubt and adds a nice wrinkle to the storyline. We close the show with Lawler giving his prediction on the main event: that Yokozuna will pin Diesel to win the WWF World title.

TV RATINGS: Raw def. Nitro 2.7 – 1.9  How the \*\*\*\* does THAT even happen?!?!?! I'm guessing that Raw had a lot of buzz about it because of the Kollision  of the Kliq opening match, but that's basically all the show had going for it! The rest of the matches were mostly watchable but still, nothing you'd want to go back and rewatch, and certainly not memorable in any way. Nitro may have had its down moments, but we got a title change, and a super fun main event. Luckily, the tide would (temporarily) start turning for WCW soon enough.

HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: Ric Flair vs Arn Anderson. It really was a toss up between this and the 1-2-3 Kid/Razor match on Raw, because honestly both were great. Which is funny when you consider that both match were essentially fueled by similar “good friends turned enemies” storylines. I mainly give the nod to Flair/Pillman because at least that had a clean finish.

LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: As much as I want to give it to Raw's main event, because King Mabel is not something I want to see in any of his forms, I can't. Owen Hart and Sir Mo carried their ends of the match so well that it wasn't nearly as bad as it had any rights to be. I have to give the Lowlight nod to the Jean Pierre LaFitte squash match, which honestly wouldn't have been the worst match of the week had it just been like 30 seconds of Wrestling Pirate wrecking the skinny diaper wearing jobber and looking super strong going into his match with Hart that Sunday.

NEXT WEEK: WWF In Your House 3, or the 3rd Anniversary of In Your House if Michael Cole was calling it! Owen Hart and Yokozuna face Kliqers Shawn Michaels and Diesel where a title change MUST HAPPEN! Unless the match ends in count out or DQ! And perhaps more importantly, Bret The Hitman Hart faces a Wrestling Pirate to retrieve his stolen jacket! ANYTHING can happen in the WWF, especially ridiculous gimmicks and angles!-The Intern

9pa14d,3,2018-10-18,The anime's problem with first episodes and finales,StabnShoot,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/9pa14d/the_animes_problem_with_first_episodes_and_finales/,"I love Studio Bones' animated adaptation of My Hero Academia: it's faithful to the original, has smooth animation and even improves on the manga in certain ways.

But if there is one thing that I dislike about it (besides OP 4) it's how they handle the first and last episode of the season, at least since Season 2 began. 

I understand that MHA's plot structure is unorthodox compared to other Shonens and takes more after western comic books, and as such it is harder to pintpoint the exact moment an arc ends since they all have a certain impact on one another, but it seems that Studio Bones is using the finales as early first episodes that foreshadow the following seasons. 

I strongly disagree with this. The first and the last are the most important episodes of the season. The first should hype people enough that they tune in every week to watch the others, while the last should both give a sense of closure and give a little tease of what's going to happen in the next one. I get what they're trying to do: starting an arc early as a cliffanger may sound like a good idea at first, but what happens usually is that the hype for the cliffanger dies in the span of a few months and the first episode of the new season is going to be a slow paced filler.

Season 3 has the worst examples; I cannot express how disappointing the first episode (basically a beach episode but with a pool) was and how it almost killed my hype, and the last episodes introduces the Big Three, which killed the possibility of a killer premiere for Season 4, which instead is now more likely to start with Izuku searching for an Internship.

At least, that's what I think. What's your opinion on the matter?"

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Great way to kick off the show for anyone who finds Eric Bischoff's commentary style (note: yelling “HULK HOGAN”, “BACK LEG FRONT KICK”, and not much else) to be tiresome: Ric Flair sneaks up on the announce team and cuts a coked up shouty promo on Dabbalay (again, his pronunciation of “Double A” when he's screaming) by stealing Bischoff's headset and screaming a promo for all of us at home, but no one in the arena. The only shame is that Bischoff got the headset back!

  
\-We also get a recap video package for the Savage/Luger “Luger's career on a pole match” tonight. Wait, sorry, I forgot, Vince Russo isn't with the company yet, so it's just a regular match with Luger's career on the line. It also covers the events of last week, where Luger was going to help the Dungeon of Doom destroy Savage, but then get attacked by The Giant because... Reasons?

  
1: “OPENING MAIN EVENT” (???) - LEX LUGER LEAVES TOWN MATCH – LEX LUGER VS MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE

  
During the introductions, Bischoff goes into full subversive shill mode: he encourages audiences not to turn into Raw if they want to see what's happening “elsewhere in the wrestling world”, but rather to call the WCW hotline and get all of the results from Mike Tenay. With scumbag tactics like this being employed, it boggles my mind that the WWF's response was “let's do terrible parody skits with Billionaire Ted, The Huckster and the Nacho Man”. The match starts with the most intense COLLAR AND ELBOW TIE UP sequence you'll ever see. Seriously, it's like both guys wanted to parlay “we're angry at each other and fired up” without sacrificing basic wrestling fundamentals, so the opening minute of the match is them locking up so hard that they SPILL OUT TO THE FLOOR, STILL IN TIE UP! There's something ludicrously incredible about that to me. Once the action proper kicks off, Savage plays the role of fired up babyface, Luger plays the role of cowardly heel (trying to take a powder to the floor early), and Bischoff plays the role of “guy who'd rather talk about how they're maintaining contact with Hogan's car phone so they'll know when he arrives at the arena, than talk about the match”. The pacing and action in this match, thank GAWD, is more like early 90's Savage than what we usually see on Nitro, and that's a breath of \*\*\*\*ing fresh air, and to Luger's credit, he holds his end of the match beautifully as well. Tell me if you've ever seen this counter before: a guy is trying to fight out of a backslide, and just as he's realizing that he's lost control and about to go over, he puts his foot underneath the top rope so he can't be backslid far enough for his shoulders to hit the ground. How cool is that? And would you believe me if I told you that LEX \*\*\*\*ING LUGER pulled that off?!?!?! I'm telling you, as much as the world remembers him as being a sh\*tty worker, the dude was underrated whenever he put his work boots on. Which sadly wasn't often enough but still. Macho hits the Big Elbow and gets the visual pin after a ref bump, which makes Savage look stupid when you consider that he can SEE THAT THE REF IS DOWN! Like I'm not even talking “oh, the ref is in his peripheral vision”, the unconscious ref was practically RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM! This brings out The (big stinky wart infected (TM Hulk Hogan)) Giant, who sneaks up on Savage (who is in the process of trying to wake the referee up) and hits him with a big Chokeslam and leaves, not touching Luger this time. Further proof of how awesome Luger could be as a character worker: both he and the ref recover at the same time, and he first starts to pin Savage, but then just to be an extra d\*ck, he picks the unconscious Savage up and puts him in the Torture Rack for the win. As far as \*\*\*\* finishes go, this was actually pretty cool, and while the match really seemed like it ended too soon and suddenly, what we got was really good. My favorite part though is that the commentary team play it up like “Luger didn't know that The Giant was there!” While I'm sure that it's plausible that he didn't know specifically that Giant interfered, there's something about the thought of him getting knocked out by the Big Elbow, seeing Savage unconscious, and going “Yep, that was ALL LEX BABY!” that just cracks me up hardcore.

  
RESULTS: Lex Luger def Randy Savage via submission

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Before our next match kicks off (and if you know your wrestling history, your reaction when you see the competitors will be similar to mine, which was something like “HIOGFKOHOHFOG YES!”), Disco Inferno comes out to badly disco dance at the entrance ramp for... reasons.  It has pretty much zero bearing on anything that happens, but if the idea was to get over Glen Gilberti as being an obnoxious d\*ck, mission accomplished. Although they could have done that just by having him talk, ahem.  


  
2: EDDIE GUERRERO VS DEAN MALENKO

  
\*\*\*\*... YES!!!!! At this point in his career, Eddie wasn't quite the Eddie that we would come to know and love. Don't get me wrong, he was still incredible in the ring, but he might as well have been Mexican Dean Malenko here: better at the in ring stuff than almost anyone in the world, but with the character personality of a trash can. Ironically, when I first got into the mid 90's era of WCW, I was kind of “meh” on Eddie until he went heel and started developing that personality he lacked, but absolutely loved Dean. No, I don't even know how any of that makes any sense either. It might not have helped that Eddie came out to the most stereotypical Mexican theme song possible, just saying. As a note, apparently Eddie earned the right to show up on Nitro tonight by wrestling a match on Worldwide by beating Jushin Liger, and... now I'm angry that we don't have episodes of Worldwide on the Network! For anyone out there who knows condescending Big League Wrestling apologists who sh\*t on anything that's not big men doing big man moves (the Vince McMahon special), and think that exciting matches don't mean anything, show them this match, please. Watching an audience go from “we don't give a sh\*t about either of these small guys because we don't know who they are” to popping like mad for pretty much everything they do speaks highly to the ability for great, exciting pro graps and its ability to connect with an audience even when the personalities involved don't. So we got this amazing match with great, fast paced technical wrestling and #GoodLuchaThings, there's only one thing that could make it more exciting, and if you're WCW, that thing is MAKING IT ALL ABOUT HULK HOGAN, because \*\*\*\*ING GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!! Throughout the match, Bischoff keeps chiming in with “We just heard Hulk is only X minutes away from the arena!”, and then when Hogan arrives, we go to the WORST SPLIT SCREEN KNOWN TO MAN in order to see it! Seriously, each of the picture in picture screens only take up the bottom quarter of the screen, leaving us a full top half of the screen being the Nitro logo and FLAMING METAL OVERLAY! And then when Jimmy Hart starts talking to Hogan about how Giant's in the building, we CUT AWAY FROM THE \*\*\*\*ING MATCH TO FOCUS ON HOGAN INSTEAD!!!!! And NOW you see why I stopped watching WCW from 1994 (Hogan's arrival) until the nWo angle started because holy sh\*t... This is too \*\*\*\*ing much. They should have called the show WCW Monday Night Hogan and be done with it. Hogan, for his part, is stupid, because he's sporting a (may I remind you) BROKEN NECK, but he's still out here to hunt down The Giant here tonight. And he's dragging scrawny Hart along with him, which makes me laugh too much to completely hate it! Thank Gawd the in ring action bookending the obviously more important Hogan stuff was still incredible enough to be must watch. The match finish comes out of nowhere, but is super dope, with both men trying to use technical wrestling superiority to take each other down, and Eddie countering a victory roll by sitting down and picking up the win. Awesome stuff, and I can only imagine how much more incredible this must have been for the live crowd than for those of us watching at home. Post-match, a fired up Malenko teases attacking, but instead demands a rematch down the line, which Eddie accepts. 

  
RESULTS: Eddie Guerrero def. Dean Malenko via pinfall

\-So remember Hulk's mission statement earlier of “Brother, you and I brother are going to hunt down The Giant brother!”? Well, apparently he decided the best way to do this was to come to the ring and do an interview with Mean Gene? O.....kay? He basically comes out to the ring to rip his shirt and declare that he's going to go backstage to find the big stinky nasty Giant, and literally none of this makes any sense. I guess Hogan just needed that spotlight? Okay, never mind, it makes perfect sense. But wait, it's not over! In a moment that doesn't absolutely telegraph that some further angle is going to happen, Hogan sticks around to slap hands with front row fans, when all of a sudden an old woman THROWS POWER IN HIS EYES! She jumps the guard rail to beat the sh\*t out of Jimmy Hart with her cane, and then assaults Hogan with it as well! Giant and the Zodiac show up, and wait a minute... That's not a woman, that's a man baby! Specifically Kevin Sullivan in drag! Giant rips off Hogan's neckbrace, and BREAKS HIS \*\*\*\*ING NECK FOR THE SECOND \*\*\*\*ING TIME! And then in my favorite part of this whole segment, Sullivan pulls out the FACIAL HAIR TRIMMERS OF DOOM, and shaves Hogan's trademark walrus stache in the most hilarious (and retroactively accurate, when you think of Hulk's views on race relations) manner possible: he starts by shaving the sides, leaving the middle part intact, and thus briefly leaving him with A HITLER STACHE! BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I don't usually like to have my good wrestling \*\*\*\*ed with, but this alone makes me forgive the cutting away from Dean/Eddie nonsense earlier in the night, A+! The American Males and The Nasty Boys (who are supposed to have a match tonight) run out to make the save, but nope, chokeslams for all. 

&amp;#x200B;

  
3: MAIN EVENT: ARN ANDERSON VS RIC FLAIR

  
Dabbalay gets the jobber entrance, because... reasons? Either way, we've seen these two wrestle at Fall Brawl, and hopefully you read my review of that match and/or watched the show, because I don't have much more to say than “this is very similar to what they did on PPV”. Which means that it \*\*\*\*ing rules so hard! The biggest difference here is that Flair is in full on fired up babyface mode, which is always so weird to see. He pulls it off beautifully, because of course he does, but watching Flair play a fired up babyface feels as out of place as, well, watching Bobby Roode work face in 2018. And then in a very “because WCW” moment, the finish! Flair almost had the match won clean, countering a Double Axe Handle with a chop, and locks in the Figure Four right in the middle of the ring. This brings Brian Pillman out, and the ref calls for the bell as soon as Pillman gets up on the top turnbuckle, but before any physical contact is made. Um... #LOLWhat?!?!?! So we're calling matches because of INTENDED interference now? OKAY THEN! He DOES splash Flair, to be fair, but still! Flair tries fighting Pillman off, but the Damned Numbers Game overwhelms him, and he gets beaten down 2-on-1. Bischoff is so concerned that as we go to commercial, he declares “We'll get an update on Hogan!” Gawd, Bischoff was so far up Hogan's ass here, he's practically riding him like a \*\*\*\*ing Gundam.

  
RESULTS: Ric Flair def. Arn Anderson via randomly occurring DQ

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-It turns out that we DON'T get an update on Hogan, but we learn that next week, Arn and Flair are getting a rematch, in a cage! Spoiler alert (one I've mentioned before), it is the world's SADDEST looking cage of all time, I swear. 

&amp;#x200B;

PART 2 - WWF MONDAY NIGHT RAW 10/2/1995

  
1: RAZOR RAMON VS THE 1-2-3 KID

  
You know, I find it kind of funny that even though Razor is the babyface in this match, his nickname is still The Bad Guy, right? Okay, all silly observations aside, the match. You know how my usual criticism of 1995 WWF is “kicky punchy chinlocky”? And how my theory is that only members of the Kliq or Hart family are allowed to have dynamic, exciting matches? Well, we have two Kliq members in action here, and the match kicks off with Razor angrily bieling the Kid over the top rope and to the floor. This is the FIRST MOVE OF THE MATCH! Kid is such a bumping machine here, he even take a bump through the middle ropes to the floor off of a Razor KICK OUT! Man, I forgot just how awesome Sean Waltman was at this point in his career, likewise with Scott Hall. A few minutes into the match, Dean Douglas comes out and starts taking notes, but the payoff is him leaving shortly after. O...kay then? Not too long after, Razor ducks a spinning wheel kick, hits a clothesline, and gets the 1-2-3 on Kid. Wait, what? That's it?!?!?! That's a \*\*\*\*ing shame, this felt way too short for a match of such quality, especially when you consider that most WWF matches at the time featured lengthy resthold sequences that felt longer than this entire bout. 

  
RESULTS: Razor Ramon def. 1-2-3 Kid via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, Kid throws a temper tantrum (I swear, I didn't mean for that phrase to be a joke!), he and Razor start shoving each other, and that leads to...

  
2: RAZOR RAMON VS 1-2-3 KID

  
\#LOLWhat?!?!?!?! No, that's not a typo, Kid's temper tantrum actually leads to an immediate rematch! I take back my complaint about the bout being so short, this is somehow both a stupid and clever way to extend the battle and give both Kliq guys more ring time. The sad news is that this second segment is still rather short, but still, both men work at a breakneck pace, and bring so much intensity, it's unlike most of what you see on a 1995 Raw. Hell, it's unlike most of what you'd see on a 1995 PPV! Funny enough, this match actually ends during a commercial break, as Razor counters a diving Rana attempt with a powerbomb for the pin, but apparently Kid threw a SECOND temper tantrum and they go into a THIRD match, but because it happened in a commercial break, I'm not creating a third entry here. It's actually kind of a clever storytelling device as well, because Kid has (thus far) defeated Razor on two separate occasions since his debut in 93, so by having Razor go over twice in the same match and go into a third overtime of sorts, this final stretch feels like a mini rubber match. And as anti-climactic as the finish might seem, I absolutely LOVED it. Razor basically has kid dead to rights after hitting a big avalanche back suplex. He picks Kid up for the Razor's Edge, hesitates, changes his mind, and decides to roll him up for the win. You've read it here folks: Scott Hall is a better babyface than virtually anyone in the 2018 WWE roster. Dude was willing to get violent and go tooth and nail with his friend turned rival, but when push came to shove, he couldn't bring himself to hit his biggest move as the killblow and opted to mercy kill his already defeated foe with fundamental wrestling instead of risking the chance of injuring him. Why the \*\*\*\* can't more modern babyfaces show this degree of “not going to put up with your bullsh\*t, but still noble” behavior? In 2018, Razor would have Razors Edge'd him onto the ring steps, and called him a gay homosexual, and we'd still be expected to cheer for him. Post-match, the two shake hands... and then Kid rolls Razor up, which for some reason the ref tries counting, but only gets a 2. O...kay then? The crowd chants “Razor's Edge!”, Kid offers himself up, almost taunting Razor to do it, but when he doesn't, they finally shake hands and depart as friends. Pretty fun post-match stuff here, and a solid way to cap off a good opening bout that was really a series of short matches chained together.

  
RESULTS: Razor Ramon def. 1-2-3 Kid via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

  
2) BARRY HOROWITZ VS HUNTER HURST HELMSLEY

  
For those of your keeping score in the game of “stupid WWF occupational gimmicks”, this is “Wrestling Blue Blood” vs “Wrestling Jewish Guy”. Seriously, it's like someone realized that Horowitz was Jewish, and decided that would be his gimmick, having him come out to Hava Nagila and everything. He even used the nickname of “The Star Of David” while wrestling elsewhere in the 90's. It's funny watching the pre jacked up HHH version of Helmsley, I'm not going to accuse him of steroids or anything (because that's a serious accusation), but I am going to JOKE about making that accusation: watching his abrupt transformation from “lean and in shape” to “jacked to the gills” is the 90's version of the body transformation of Jinder Mahal. One would think that this is a rote jobber squash, and you'd be right in assuming as much, but because this is a mere couple of months after Horowitz got his shock upset victory over Skip (poor Chris Candido), he's actually allowed to have some hope spots and even a nearfall off of a sunset flip, so it's slightly more competitive than your usual squash match. Unfortunately for Horowitz, this isn't 1996, and Hunter isn't being punished for the Curtain Call yet, so he eats a Pedigree off of an attempted back body drop. Womp womp! Man, part of me really wishes that Barry Horowitz: midcard star would have been a real thing, history (and my own brain) remembers him as being a nothing jobber, but he was actually a really good worker, and the crowd was super into him tonight. But alas, one might say that the future HHH was able to hold down a would be star, something that he would never do ever again. Cough cough.

  
RESULTS: Hunter Heart Helmsley def. Barry Horowitz via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

  
3) PG-13 VS SOME JOBBERS

  
Wait, PG-13 wrestled in the WWF prior to their run as the Nation Of Domination's heaters/rap intro guys?!?!?! How the \*\*\*\* didn't I remember these rapping goofballs?!?!?!?! PG-13 are, besides being future NoD token white guys, the (at the time) Memphis USWA tag team champions, consisting of Bill Dundee's son Jamie (wrestling as J.C. Ice), and Wolfie D, who TNA fans might remember as Slash from the New Church stable. This is just another rote squash match, but is still a pretty good showcase for the Memphis tag team, who are both pretty good workers, it makes me wonder why they never really became a thing. Or if they did, why I don't remember it happening. Picture Too Cool, only with two guys who were better workers than either Brian Christopher or Scott Taylor, and you get the idea. They pick up the win after hitting a double bulldog (which Lawler refers to as “The Double Dog”, because who knows what hit slang the kids are saying better than a guy who was once accused of sodomizing a 15 year old? Ahem...), and Ice tilt-o-whirl slamming his own partner onto Jobber B.

  
RESULTS: PG-13 def Some Jobbers via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

  
4) MAIN EVENT: JEAN-PIERRE LAFITTE VS BRET HART

  
Last time, it was personal (well, as personal as a battle over a \*\*\*\*ing jacket can be), this time, it's a rematch that's wrestling for the sake of wrestling? Sounds about right! For some reason, they show footage of Hart's legendary loss to the British Bulldog at Wembley Stadium during Hart's entrance, because that clearly had everything to do with this match, right? So do you remember my review of their IYH match two weeks prior, how I was initially like “this is slow paced and kind of boring” and then nope, it built up into an exciting bout? Same applies here, as the match doesn't take long to ramp up from “Ugh, LaFitte is using the slowest offense in the world to control Hart” to “Oh sh\*t, things got heated up and now they're just beating the piss out of each other out on the floor!” What is this, a 2018 match where everyone is obligated to use the barricade and/or steel steps as an environmental weapon? I'm not complaining, because it's pretty awesome in 2018, and was fantastic in 1995. Bret slamming LaFitte spine first onto the ring steps is like the 1995 version of that time Kevin Owens took a Michinoku Driver on top of a ladder, just DAMN! The match remains appropriately heated up once the action returns into the ring, with both men bringing great intensity to their offense, with Hart working his ass off as a bumping machine, and LaFitte doing a good job selling Bret's offense when the tables turn, both men do an excellent job of making each other look great, and making the match overall look like a real struggle, great stuff here. Again, my talking point of “only the Kliq and the Harts were allowed to have good matches” seems to hold up. The set up for the finish here was pretty sweet as well, as LaFitte goes up to for the Cannonball, but Hart gets to hit feet, crotches him on the turnbuckle, and hits what I can only describe as a Snap Superplex. Seriously, he basically just takes him up and over rapidly like a Snap Suplex, that might have been the most crisp, intense execution of a Superplex I've seen outside of a Chris Benoit match! The Sharpshooter, of course, follows right behind and for the second time in two weeks, Bret has overcome Wrestling Pirate in the best match of the show. 

  
RESULTS: Bret Hart def. Jean-Pierre LaFitte via submission

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, Lawler has words for Hart, stands up on the table, and rips off his top, showing off his Dad Bod in an act of challenge. Bret takes him up on the challenge and starts attacking Lawler, punching him so hard the he flips over the guard rail. Then OOPS, Isaac Yankem attacks from behind, planting Bret with the DDS, while the crowd chants Diesel. HAHAHAHA, chanting Diesel at Glen Jacobs? They have no idea how prophetic they're being, but we'll get there in 1996! This is leading to a cage match between Hart and Yankem within the next few weeks, and I kinda wish it would have been Hart vs Lawler just to see how Jerry's chickensh\*t heel act would lend itself to being trapped in an enclosed area against a pissed up Canadian who may or may not know that wrestling isn't real.

  
\-We get a brief promo spot with Jim Cornette, Owen Hart and British Bulldog putting over next week's 6 man tag against HBK, Diesel and Undertaker, followed by the babyface's retort. And that's how we end the show!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
TV RATINGS: Raw and Nitro tied at 2.5 apiece. This doesn't really surprise me as man, both shows were actually both very good all around. October 2nd, 1995 was an awesome night for pro wrestling! 

  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK: Do I even have to tell you that it's Malenko vs Guerrero? Even with all of the Hogan interruption bullsh\*t, that match was on a whole other level for what we were seeing in1995, and was honestly just heralding bigger and better things to come, like so much Silver Surfer heralding the arrival of Galactus. Only it brings tidings of awesome matches instead of “this big guy's going to eat your planet”!

  
LOWLIGHT OF THE WEEK: It's honestly hard to find anything I can consider  true lowlight, so while I have to give it to the PG-13 squash match, that's not even me saying it was bad in any way, it was just the least good thing on either show. But man, every single match in this review was pretty awesome in its own way, even the two WWF squashes.   


  
NEXT WEEK: Ric Flair and Arn Anderson attempt to settle their beef in a world's shortest cage! Plus the 6 man tag that I'm 90% is the reason why Undertaker had to wrestle as the world's tallest Phantom of the Opera for awhile!

PART 1 - WCW MONDAY NITRO 10/16/1995  


  
\-I should note here that during our usual “commentary team hyping up the card” opening, Bischoff asks the question of “Will it be Sting and Flair taking on Double A and Pillman later tonight?” Once again, THIS is why I feel like the WWE REALLY needs to add the Saturday night shows from this era to the Network, the only reason I know that this was a Saturday night development was because thankfully, they showed a clip of that conversation (where Sting says “Yeah I'll help you, but if you screw me over I'm \*\*\*\*ing murdering you!”, basically) to give it at least SOME context. Also, a point I made last week, why the \*\*\*\* doesn't the WWE use Main Event to actually develop storylines that will be further continued on Raw? It'd actually give viewers a reason to watch it beyond “Hey, look at these guys you never see on tv!”  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: TV TITLE MATCH: DIAMOND DALLAS PAGE (C) (W/THE DIAMOND DOLL) VS JOHNNY B. BADD

  
...doesn't actually happen, and for pretty fun reasons! Before the bell can ring, DDP does what realistically, more heel champions should do: rushes over and bashes Badd in the back of the \*\*\*\*ing head with the belt to knock him the \*\*\*\* out. WOMP WOMP! He further shows that even in 1995, Page was more awesome than I've ever given him credit for by grabbing Badd's Badd Blaster (his confetti gun, not a penis joke, I swear!), yelling “I'm a BADD MAN!” to taunt the crowd, making the lazy cover on Badd, counting his own pin, and then firing off the Badd Blaster (again, not a penis joke!) to celebrate his “victory”! Huh, DDP was awesome in 1995, who knew?!?!?! The funny thing is, in a heel sort of way this attack was justified. As shown on a recent Saturday Night (again with things happening in syndication that we don't have on the Network yet!), Badd found out that Page flattened the tires on his car to prevent him from getting to the arena on time for a US title match, so Badd sucker punched (as Heenan put it) Page in retaliation. A+ storytelling for a non-match.

  
RESULTS: No Contest  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: EDDIE GUERRERO VS CHRIS BENOIT

  
...or as the description on the WWE Network reads, “Eddie Guerrero in singles action”, because when you're Chris Benoit, you're blackballed 4 life! So yeah, even with the horrible legacy Benoit left behind at the end of his life, if you aren't salivating at the thought of these two tearing it up in 1995, I don't even know what to tell you besides screaming “WATCH THIS \*\*\*\*ING MATCH!” I'm not even kidding when I tell you that you could put this match on the indies scene in 2018, and it would hold up, and hell, would probably be better than most of the show thanks to the urgency both men work with, and the ability to tell an in ring story rather than just do “moar movez”. A lot of the later portion of the match revolves around Eddie selling an arm injury caused by missing a clothesline outside of the ring and connecting with the turnbuckle post, and Benoit being savvy enough to work the clearly injured limb, which plays beautifully into the finish, but we'll get there in a moment. I just want to take a moment to put over the one powerbomb spot in this match, specifically Benoit powerbombing Eddie, because holy sh\*t, that might have been the best looking normal ass powerbomb I've ever seen, bar none. When Eddie went up for it, he went up with such velocity that it looked less like he was sitting up to protect himself, and more like he was being folded in two by the sheer force of the ascent. And when he was slung down to the mat, it was done with such speed and power that even Bischoff, who normally can't be bothered to pay attention to non-Hogan content, had to go partial Mauro and freak out about it. So \*\*\*\*ing good! And as alluded to above, the finish to the match actually pays off the limb work done earlier on, as Eddie starts mounting a comeback, gets fired up, instinctively throws a big right punch... but that was also the arm that was injured. It dazed and hurt Benoit, sure, but it absolutely devastated Eddie long enough to let Chris sneak in to land the Dragon Suplex and pick up the win. Amazing, amazing match, if this isn't “Highlight of the Night” then I will legit be surprised.

  
RESULTS: Benoit def. Guerrero via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-After shilling for the WCW Hotline, Mean Gene brings out both Kevin Sullivan and The Giant for an in ring interview. I should note a fun touch here: now that Hogan is wearing black and is all dark and emo, Sullivan is out here wearing robes that are... wait for it... Yellow and red. It's good basic symbolism, made more awesome by the fact that the commentary team didn't have to go full WWE 2018 hamfisted on us and scream about how those are Hogan's colors and spell out what everything means because we marks are too \*\*\*\*ing stupid to figure it out ourselves. Ahem. Instead, Sullivan claims that Hogan “gave up is colors” when they cut his mustache and “took his identity”, which is a great, semi cryptic but still pretty clear way to explain it. Giant follows up this talk of colors and evil by cutting a pretty generic “big bad wrestling heel” promo, made memorable only by the fact that he starts it off with both a “let me tell you something” AND a “brother”. That had to be an intentional riff on Hogan, right?  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: MENG VS “HACKSAW” JIM DUGGAN

  
And now, the direct opposite of Benoit vs Eddie! So yeah, Jim Duggan... This WCW version of Duggan is easily my least favorite of all time, allow me to elaborate/avoid having to talk about this match. In the early/mid 80's, Duggan was actually a solid worker and a really good heel down in Mid South. I call this form “Best Jim Duggan”. In 1987, he showed up in the WWF, changed his gimmick to “ex football playing patriot who is maybe brain damaged?”, and changed his entire in ring style to kicky punchy. It was awesome when you're a kid watching it, not so awesome after. And then there's WCW Duggan, hoo boy... Take WWF Duggan, but add to it “Cheats his ass off by storing rolls of tape in his crotch, and using them to tape up his fists mid match so he has SUPER TAPE PUNCHES!” He is, of course, a babyface, so why WOULDN'T he cheat?!?!?! I also assume that he had kind of a proto Joey Ryan thing going on because I'm not going to lie, unless he's using his d\*ck as like a coat hanger peg for those rolls of tape, then I don't even know what the point of any of this is. His gimmick would get new wrinkles to it over the 4 or 5 years (GOOD GAWD) he's employed by the company, but we'll get there in time. But yeah, the match itself is the most 80's bland WWF style kicky punchy affair possible, where the most athletic move performed is, like, a \*\*\*\*ing bodyslam, and the only nice things I have to say about it are “at least it was short”, and “the finish was pretty cool”: after hitting the big bodyslam, Hacksaw taunts that he's going to go for the 3 Point Stance, but Meng gets up, thrust kicks him in the \*\*\*\*ing face, and locks in the Tongan Death Grip (called the Golden Spike by commentary, even though that's the name of a weapon and not a submission hold) to mercy kill the match for us all.

  
RESULTS: Meng def. Duggan via submission  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-And now, Evil Black Wearing Hulk Hogan gets to cut a very cheesy promo about how Sullivan is right, Hogan IS evil now, and is going to take care of business MAFIA DON STYLE! He also seems to think that Giant broke his back and not his neck, because #LOLWhat?!?!?! And that he's BASICALLY going to SHOOT MURDER Giant. Which, um... spoiler alert, kind of happens... Kind of. Note: he keeps calling himself “evil”, but still extols the virtues of the prayers, training and vitamins, as well as his little Hulkamaniacs like he were NOT evil, so... additional #LOLWhat?!?!?!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: MAIN EVENT: ARN ANDERSON AND “FLYIN'” BRIAN PILLMAN VS RIC FLAIR AND STING

  
Except Sting doesn't come out with Flair... and doesn't even come out at all! DUN DUN DUN! Maybe all of those comments I've made over the years about Sting being an idiot aren't true after all? (Note: they are, and he still is, as you'll see in a few weeks...) So man, if you ever wondered what Ric Flair would be like if he worked a more fired up babyface style like Tommy “Wildfire” Rich back in the day, this is the match for you. Dude is working with insane intensity here, he's taking Arn and Pillman to the woodshed so badly that I want to call THEM the underdogs in spite of the 2-on-1 advantage, it's pretty bonkers because it flies in the face of YEARS of Flair wrestling history, but it's also pretty dope. Towards the end of the match, Flair eats a beautiful Dabbalay Spinebuster (which is like the 6th or 7th offensive move he took, I swear), when Sting makes his way out to finally join the match! NOW Flair starts taking offense, working the face in peril role, until he makes the hot tag to Sting, who channels his inner Ric Flair (apparently) and destroys both heels by himself. Arn gets clotheslined over the top rope, Pillman gets press slammed off of the top turnbuckle, d\*ck first onto the top rope and spills to the floor, and the heels opt to take the count out loss rather than take any further punishment.  
RESULTS: Flair and Sting def. Anderson and Pillman via count out  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, Mean Gene hits the ring to interview the winners of tonight's main event. Apparently, Sting needed to watch the match to see if Flair had any heart and guts, and decided that watching Flair easily destroy the team of Ric Flair's Best Friend, and Ric Flair's Best Friend's Associate meant Flair was trustworthy, and not only came out to help him tonight, but the rematch will happen at Halloween Havoc. As you will see in a few weeks, everything goes fine in that match, and I don't find any reason to make “Sting is a stupid idiot” jokes, nope!

&amp;#x200B;

PART 2 - WWF MONDAY NIGHT RAW 10/16/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-“Isaac Yankem... Jerry Lawler... You are both the tartar and the abscess of the World Wrestling Federation!” This was seriously a thing Bret Hart said in the cold open promo hyping the main event cage match. Yeesh, 1997 can't get here soon enough, in terms of the Hitman's ability to talk on a microphone and not sound like a moron!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: HUNTER HEARST HELMSLEY VS DOINK THE CLOWN

  
Or for those of you keeping up on your stupid Occupational Gimmicks, Wrestling Blueblood vs Wrestling Clown. The bad news here is that we're long past the point of Doink's surprisingly awesome heel persona, played by Matt Bourne; rather this is the stupid ass, lame ass babyface version played by Ray Apollo, which I hated even as a young teen. The good news is that at least we're past the point where he was accompanied by Dink, the stupid ass, lame ass midget clown, so... We'll call it a wash? Not that it matters much anyway, as he'd been used as a jobber by this point in his career anyway, and in fact this is his last televised match before making a sporadic re-appearance in 1997, and then other sporadic one time appearances. But yeah, remember my theory that only members of the Kliq or Hart family are allowed to have good matches? This ABSOLUTELY does not apply here, as the not yet fully actualized Hunter and the on his way out of the company Doink put on the most 1995 Raw possible, where the furthest from “punchy kicky chinlocky body slammy” they stray is Hunter's knee based attacks that he loves so much, and the most exciting spot is Doing grabbing Hunter's nose (because it's BIG, GET IT?!?!?!) and hitting it. Woof! Though Hunter here has yet to get completely jacked up, put in a position of great power, and-uh cutting-uh 20 minute promos-uh where he-uh talks-uh like this-uh, he still manages to bury his opponent as expected, avoiding the ACTUAL most exciting spot in the match (an attempted twisting crossbody, which was way more than I was expecting out of Apollo Doink), and hits the Pedigree for the finish. Somewhere out there, I can't help but imagine Conrad Thompson going “Like he ALWAYS \*\*\*\*ING DOES!”

  
RESULTS: Helmsley def. Doink via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Huh, I didn't realize that Hakushi was still kicking around at this point! For those of you who aren't up on your puro history, Hakushi is better known under the name of Jinsei Shinzaki, and he is a legit Gawd Damn LEGEND, known mostly for his lengthy and successful tenure in Michinoku Pro (where he serves as their president currently), as well as having runs in FMW and NJPW at different points. For me, he is up there with the likes of The Great Muta, The Great Sasuke, Jushin Liger, Masahiro Chono, Bull Nakano, and Ultimo Dragon in the category of “workers who made The Intern want to seek out Japanese wrestling and fall in love with it”. Sadly here, he is on the downswing of his WWE career, has turned babyface, and gets a little backstage segment where Barry Gawd Damn Horowitz tries to teach him how to be more American. By talking about baseball. And Hakushi is the one who has to correct Horowitz when he \*\*\*\*s up a baseball fact because hey, if you believe every Jewish stand up comedian ever, it's not like the Jews know anything about sports, amirite?!?!?! (Note: I'm sure that most Jewish people, or people of all faiths and cultures, know more about sports than I do.)

2: TAG TITLE MATCH: PG-13 VS THE SMOKING GUNNS (C)

  
BAHAHAHAHA! Before the match starts, we get a pre-recorded promo with PG-13, and there's something about them trying to talk like thugs from da hood, but also sporting the most Memphis sounding accents possible that cracks me the \*\*\*\* up! We also get a picture in picture conversation between commentary and Gorilla Monsoon to discuss one of TWO planned PPV matches being bait and switched due to real life injuries! It turns out, my memory was right, and last week's assault on Undertaker did indeed lead to his face getting destroyed, which brings us good news: next week, we don't have to watch a Taker vs King Mabel match! YAY, GO MABEL!!!! The bad news (lots of good news/bad news going on here) is that as punishment for aiding Mabel in injuring Taker, it'll be Yokozuna taking the spot. Holy \*\*\*\*... I am staunchly anti-suicide, but just the thought of that makes me want to go find a bathtub and a toaster! As for the match... Remember me using way too many words to say that our opening match wasn't really that good? Hunter and Doink was \*\*\*\*ing Misawa vs Kobashi compared to this. I will give infinite bonus points to both members of PG-13 for making this watchable through their hilarious cocky heel taunting and general antics but yeah, no, just no. Also, holy sh\*t I wish Lawler wouldn't set me up for horrible burns so badly! Here's a snippet of commentary, with my first reaction. Vince: “Why do they call them PG-13 anyway?” Jerry: “Because their moms still have to take them to the movies.” Me: “Kind of like your DATES Jerry?!?!?!” SEE? Too easy!!!! But yeah, long story short, PG-13 are pretty great here just because of their character work, the Smoking Gunns are more like the Steaming Piles, but they're working guys who they can throw around like rag dolls so they at least look like powerhouses, and the champions pick up the victory with their Side Slam/Alabama Jam finish. I THINK it's called the Sidewinder, but if you listen to Vince, it's called the “WHATA DEVASTATING MANEUVER!” 

  
RESULTS: Smoking Gunns def. PG-13 via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Oh damn, we're actually getting a Women's title match next week? If only this were still the point in time where Alundra Blayze was tearing it up with, like, Aja Kong and Bull \*\*\*\*ing Nakano (still my favorite women's wrestler of all time), but nope, those great USA vs Joshi matches have been swept aside to give us Blayze vs BERTHA FAYE, BLAH! Take Canadian wrestler Monster Ripper (as she was known in Japan)/Rhonda Singh (as she was known in Stampede Wrestling), an actual legit really good big woman wrestler in the same kind of vein as Nakano. Now, because it's the WWF, make her a comedy character, give her the gimmick of “is dating Harvey Wippleman, and is also \*\*\*\*ing trailer trash” and you have some kind of idea what we're dealing with. Or to put it in Occupation Gimmicks terms, “Tune in next week when FUTURE MONSTER TRUCK DRIVER takes on WRESTLING ROSEANNE BARR!”  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Next we get a REALLY pre-recorded interview (like a week prior) between Dok Hendrix and the British Bulldog, where they discuss Bulldog pulling an “X has pinned the Y champion” in the main event last week. Thankfully, Cornette handles the bulk of the interview here, because as much as I love and miss Bulldog, he didn't really have much of anything noteworthy to say besides “I'm the British Bulldog and I'm BIZARRRRRRRE!” that one time. Again, it's way too many words to basically say “Hah! You fell for our plan last week, now Bulldog proved that he can beat you Diesel, and he'll do it again!” but as usual, Corney is so amazing on the mic that it doesn't even matter. Meanwhile, Bulldog's most memorable quip here is “Diesel, I beat you once, and I'm gonna beat you again! IN! YOUR! HOUSE!” Now I know he means he's going to beat him at Sunday's PPV, but the way he worded it, it sounds more like he's going to visit Kevin Nash's home and beat the sh\*t out of him there, which cracks me up for reasons I don't even understand.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Speaking of British Bulldog, now we get a short video clip featuring a man who's mic skills make Bulldog's sound like Cornette's by comparison, as Ahmed Johnson gets to do some talking! He's apparently talking about honor, and I have here the full transcript of his promo, based on what I heard. And here it is: “AJPJHDPIKPHO)FIDP\_SUI(G(I)FHP\_OUJOPGH}PU)IGF))GF)GH! DAS! HONAH!” So yeah, the next time someone on the internet condescends about how Shinsuke Nakamura will never make it in the WWE because he can't speak English, please remind them about good ole Ahmed, how he only had like 10% of Nakamura's ability to communicate in the English language and people still loved the sh\*t out of him anyway.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: DEAN DOUGLAS VS SOME JOBBER

  
Okay, so this jobber squash is actually kind of notable. Not because of the match itself, but because it's the backdrop for us learning about the SECOND of IYH's two bait and switch matches: those of you who know your wrestling history already know where I'm going here, but for reals, Michaels wound up getting roughed up by anywhere between 3-85 Marines (depending on who's telling the story, it fluctuates wildly), getting a bad concussion, and may or may not be able to compete on Sunday, gasp! Luckily, HBK has never been one to use a legit (or made up) injury as an excuse to forfeit a title and not have to job, so I'm sure everything goes as planned, ahem. This would later on, of course, lead to one of my favorite pre-Attitude Era moments ever, when he faces Owen Hart in a singles match, but we'll get there in due time. For those who are curious, here Vince says the attack was done by “10 thugs”, and that it was “unprovoked”, which might be the funniest thing I've heard all day! Lawler's claim of “he was running his mouth off in a nightclub” is much closer to the truth, based on accounts of that night from other wrestlers. In perhaps the most picture perfect bit of symbolism to describe Douglas' career path, he picks up the win with a Fisherman's Suplex (and sadly not the School Boy Roll Up, which would have fit his gimmick), and probably no one at home noticed or gave a sh\*t because the bottom quarter of the screen was taken up by a picture of HBK, who was “on the phone” with commentary and distracting us from the match by talking about how sh\*t things are for him. Well, things will get better for Douglas soon when he gets that IC title match on Sunday, right?!?!?! Ahem...

  
RESULTS: Douglas def. Jobber via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Well, we have a few minutes to kill while they set up the cage for tonight's main event, why not get an awesome movie reference filled promo out of Goldust? He'll be taking on Marty “I'll probably be fired in 3-6 months for booze and/or drugs” Jannetty (I don't know this for a fact, I just know that's how his career tended to go) on Sunday, and gives some hype for that match by saying movie things.   


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-After showing footage of Yokozuna and Mabel breaking Undertaker's face, we get a sad promo from Paul Bearer where he sounds kind of like how I imagine a weeping manatee to sound (not a fat joke, it's a joke on his voice), but also promising that he'll be back sooner than later to get revenge, and to mess them up even more than they did to him. Well, they're both dead now, and he's still alive so... mission accomplished? (I'm so going to hell for that...)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: MAIN EVENT - CAGE MATCH: ISAAC YANKEM VS BRET HART

  
As a reminder of the match stipulation here, if Lawler gets involved, he'll be placed inside of a shark cage and suspended above the ring. That oughta keep him from sticking his nose into the match! Interesting to note that although this is one of those “escape the cage to win” only matches, the door to the cage gets locked at the top of the bout, making those comments Lawler keeps making about being the “key to victory” seem all the less suspicious, ahem. It's also the big blue cage ala Wrestlemania II, which means that the action is more than somewhat on the obscured side, thanks big blue obstruction! As far as how I'd rate it as a match, I'd say it's not up to Bret's usual standards, but is pretty good for a still green pre-Kane Glen Jacobs match, and easily the best thing on tonight's show. Which isn't saying much but still, it's an enjoyable match all around, if a little more on the punchy kicky side than I like to see from a Hart match. Also, apparently the wrestlers CAN escape through the door, except they have to call the referee to unlock it... only the ref is apparently incompetent and unable to unlock it! What a jerk! No, wait a minute, JERRRY LAWLER is the jerk, because it turns out that he switched locks, and HE has the key to that locked door! DUN DUN DUN! Okay, that's a fun twist that I absolutely forgot about! Also fun, I would usually scoff at wrestlers for doing stupid things like use submission holds in a match where you can't win that way, but Vince and Lawler, of all people, point out that by locking Yankem in the Sharpshooter, Bret is hurting his back and essentially ensuring that he won't be in any condition to stop any escape attempt. It's such pitch perfect commentary storytelling and I can't believe it's coming from this team! Hart indeed then tries to escape, Yankem is indeed too incapacitated to get up, so Lawler leaves the table, scales the cage, and punches Bret off. OH NO, NOW JERRY'S GONNA BE IN A SHARK CAGE! WOMP WOMP! After losing a brawl at the top of the cage, Lawler indeed gets locked behind bars (and this time not for pedophilia sodomy charges!) and is hoisted above the cage, all set to a Burger King chant. I don't know if he's still mic'd, or if the house mics are catching him, but as he acts like a big scared crybaby, we can hear everything he's saying, and you'd think it'd be a terrible distraction but it's actually pretty funny! Also funny is that Lawler gets an apparent nosebleed up there (not sure if it's fake blood or if it was legit), and Vince just carries on like it's the funniest thing he's seen, proving that Mr McMahon was ALWAYS an evil pr\*ck! Great false finish towards the tail end of the match, as Yankem hits the DDS, and almost escapes, but at the last moment Bret is able to get up, rush over, and pull him back in as he's just about finished going over the top. And in your surprising swerve (which was pretty predictable actually, so not really surprising) finish, the heel cheating wound up failing! After sending  Bret chest first into the turnbuckle, Yankem signals to Lawler, who then drops the keys down to the dentist. Yankem tries unlocking the door, but apparently sucks at doing so, Bret is able to attack him, throw the key out of the cage, hit several of his Five Moves of Doom (backbreaker, bulldog, and diving elbow in this case). One climb later and just like that, Hart is able to defeat the future Big Red Machine in the Big Blue Cage.

  
RESULTS: Hart def. Yankem via escape  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
TV RATINGS: Raw def. Nitro, 2.6 - 2.2. WHAT?!?!?! Man, I guess you have to give a lot of credit to the power of having a big cage match main event, featuring your best worker (and soon to be #1 contender at Survivor Series, apparently), because those ratings are definitely NOT an indication of which show was better. Raw was literally a one match show, with little to nothing else being remotely worth your while, whereas Nitro largely delivered as a whole. And hey, who knew that the WWE trope of “making lame go home shows” existed all the way back in 1995?  


  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: If you think this was anything BUT Benoit/Guerrero, then I welcome you to Vintage Intern because not knowing means that you're probably not familiar with my work, and my taste in wrestling! All kidding aside, as fun as the main events to both shows were, they were what I'd call great 1995 matches. What Chris and Eddie did in the ring was somehow both super ahead of its time, and at the same time very much timeless, and in a whole other league.  


  
LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: You'd probably think I'm going to give this to Duggan/Meng, and believe me, I'd love to do so, t I can't in good conscience because at least that was something I can acknowledge as being a match. Likewise with the Gunns/PG-13 title match, which was a glorified squash where titles happened to be on the line. No, for me the true lowlight was the Dean Douglas squash, a match so bland, unimportant, and overshadowed by the literally phoned in conversation with HBK that you almost didn't realize there was a match going on. It was the wrestling equivalent to taking a nap, and leaving the tv on as background noise.  


  
NEXT WEEK: WWF In Your House 4! A night where Goldust makes his debut, British Bulldog goes for the World title, HBK will absolutely be in shape to face Dean Douglas (ahem...), and 0 matches get a 3 or more star rating from Meltzer! Plus Yokozuna and Mabel! #PrayForIntern

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-To give you an idea of how \*\*\*\*ed we are right off of the bat, because we're in the Godless Socialist Communist Republic of Canadia (as Donald Trump calls us, probably), we kick off with the singing of Oh Canada by “up and coming international sensation Toni Wilson”, and I have two notes here: (1) I have no \*\*\*\*ing idea who this woman is, so I'm guessing the words “up and coming” and “sensation” were all very much tongue in cheek; (2) now that I've heard of her, I'd love to go back in time to before this moment because sh\*t, to borrow a joke from Jimmy Pop of the Bloodhound Gang, she sings like an amputee: can't hold a note, can't carry a tune. Let this set the tone of tonight's PPV!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-We also get a somber update on HBK's condition from Gorilla Monsoon: because Michaels isn't cleared to wrestle tonight, he'll be forfeiting the IC title to Dean Douglas, who will then be defending the title against Razor Ramon. This is the first, and most definitely the last time that HBK would forfeit a title instead of doing a job. Clearly. The fact that Monsoon uses what we fans now call “the Owen voice” (as in the hushed tones used when Owen tragically passed) means I don't know whether this is hilarious or heinous, so I'm going to say both and call it a wash.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: FATU VS HUNTER HEARST HELMSLEY

  
What a way to kick off the show: the battle between Samoan Wrestling Hip Hop Community Activist vs Wrestling Rich Snooty Blue Blood! Funny enough, a few years later, Fatu would claim he did it for The Rock (“it” meaning “attempted vehicular manslaughter on Austin”) but would later reveal that the man behind it was none other than Helmsley himself. So if you ever wondered where the storied history between Rikishi and HHH began, it started in the opening match on a sh\*tty B PPV in Canada. For a match that I don't recall having any kind of story behind it, I actually loved the way it kicked off, with Fatu going full street fighting mode, attacking Hunter before he can even strip out of his suit, and just brawling all over the ring and the floor with him, with Helmsley doing some great overdone bumping and selling to put the offense over. It's what I like to call kicky punchy work done right, as it's still the antithesis to good workrate but manages to look exciting. Also exciting is seeing Fatu, who I remind you is destined to become Rikishi, do a LEAPFROG in the corner to avoid a charge! Okay, I never expected to see THAT! And the way Hunter turns the match around is the kind of gruesome stuff you wouldn't see today: he attempts to throw Fatu through the ropes and to the floor, and in the process Fatu tangles the top and middle rope up around his neck to choke the sh\*t out of himself! DAMN! I'm glad this isn't happening in a WCW ring in Germany, because that's a good way to lose an ear, ask Mick Foley! Ahem... Although he does so by throwing weak looking working punches and kicks, the fact that Hunter followed up on this by attacking a prone and choking Fatu was a great touch of added heat. Unfortunately from here, the pace of the match slows down, and what started as a fun, spirited brawl devolves to the standard WWF kicky punchy chinlocky style we've all come to know and... Well, not love, so just come to know. Though I have to give props to Fatu for selling a clothesline by doing a flipping senton to nothing! It's the kind of sell I'd expect to see from HBK, 1-2-3 Kid, or Mr Perfect, not from \*\*\*\*ing Rikishi! Fatu's comeback is pretty fun as well, as he completely no sells a DDT, due to the Samoan blessing of having a tough skull (IT'S THAT SAMOAN BLOOD MAGGLE!), he hits a series of moves including a running Diamond Cutter (from the corner, not from out of nowhere, therefore it's not an RKO), but then it happens: Hunter reminds himself that Fatu is young, up and coming talent, moves out of the way of a Big Splash, grabs his shovel, hits the Pedigree, and buries Fatu for the 1-2-3.  


RESULTS: Helmsley def. Fatu via pinfall  


MELTZER RATING: \*\* Pretty hard to argue with that, I feel like if Helmsley would have had a shorter heat period, this might have been closer to \*\*\* because Fatu was hot FIRE tonight! But yeah, Hunter controlled way too much of the match with very sound, but very boring offense, taking what could have been a great match and dragging it down to just pretty good. But hey, on the plus side, this was still pretty damn good!

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, Lawler tries to interview Hunter about his victory/to mock Fatu, and it's kinda funny hearing the future Triple H talk in such effeminate tones here, hahaha! Of course, because WWF Babyfaces have always been total trash, Henry Godwin shows up to ambush/try to slop Hunter, who uses Lawler as a human shield. Okay, that \*\*\*\*ing popped me! Eventually, Wrestling Blue Blood disengages from Wrestling King and books it backstage, with Wrestling Hog Farmer hot on his heels. Yes, I love how I can describe so many wrestlers from this era with the formula of Wrestling X, where X = non-wrestling occupation!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-And now, Dok Hendrix gets a few words with Bulldog and Cornette about tonight's main event/world title match. I had forgotten that just two months prior (and before the scope of these reviews), Bulldog and Diesel were apparently friends, until Davey went heel and turned on him. I also love how Bulldog calls the PPV “In Yer 'Oose”, because British accents are seriously the best! Then again, McMahon pronounces Davey's name as “The Bittish Booldawg”, so maybe people in the WWF just can't speak properly? Is it all a pre-cursor to Kurt Angle seemingly thinking he works for the “Dubb Dubba Wee”?  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: TAG TITLE MATCH: THE SMOKING GUNNS (C) VS RAZOR RAMON AND THE 1-2-3 KID

  
Wait! Weren't Ramon and the Kid JUST FEUDING over petty jealousy on Kid's part?!?!?! Did they get back together just to get put in a title match with a “BUT CAN THEY CO-EXIST?!?!?!” storyline? Hell, if I thought that Michael Cole actually liked wrestling, I'd guess that a young Maggle was yelling that very question at his tv screen while watching at home in 1995! Also, the Gunns have lost the mullets and mustaches they were sporting less than a week ago, and thus losing the one thing I enjoyed about the team. Although this is straight up baby vs baby, Team Kliq kind of become the defacto heels here, snubbing the Gunns on the pre-match offer of a handshake. Although this is the WWF, where the good guys are the biggest d\*cks ever, so I guess that makes them the faces here? Based on the crowd reaction, at the very least, Razor is straight up babyface because \*\*\*\*, the crowd is absolutely into everything he does; the pop that happened just over him getting tagged in was insane! But then they do things like Kid sending Bart to the floor by pulling the top rope down (following an Irish Whip) while the ref was admonishing Billy for I don't even know what, so I don't even know what to tell you. The match itself is still largely standard fare kicky punchy stuff whenever Kid's not in the ring, but is worked like it's in fast forward, and I think maybe that's the only reason I get so \*\*\*\*ing bored with the 1995 WWF style. The punching, the kicking, even the rest holds don't bother me as much as the lack of urgency behind any of it, which is why the style works here: the faster pace is the key. Further confusing the issue of “What alignment is everyone here?”, Bart plays face in peril for a chunk, makes the hot tag to Billy, and then after the hot tag shine, the tables get turned and Kid plays face in peril. I don't dislike it, and think it's actually a fun dynamic/twist on the usual tag team formula, it just makes it hard to get behind either team beyond using “I like these guys better” as a reason. Eventually the hot tag is made to Razor, and as Vince makes the call of of “Billy getting hammered! Now Bart getting hammered!”, I can't help but think of how retroactively accurate it is to use the word “hammered” in a sentence multiple times when referring to Scott Hall, ahem. And now, your WWF Babyfaces Are Stupid Idiots finish of the night! Razor plants Billy in the middle of the ring with a Razor's Edge, and prepares to make the cover but nope, Kid starts motioning that HE wants to be tagged in so HE can make the pin. Because “Scott Hall” and “good judgement” never belonged in the same sentence together prior to DDP Yoga, Razor makes the tag, Kid does the lazy “I'm pinning you with my back” pin, Billy counters with a crucifix pin, and Razor just stands on the apron watching it happen instead of... you know, helping his partner. WOMP WOMP! I guess he figures that hey, he's already got another title shot later tonight, right? Note: Seeing how Billy basically got the win by luring Kid in to make the cocky pin, is this an early example of Kliq Baiting? 

  
RESULTS: Smoking Gunns def. Razor and Kid via pinfall (Billy pinned Kid)

  
MELTZER RATING: \*\*3/4 (Match of the Night) Hard to argue that call, I'm not exactly what you'd call the biggest Smoking Gunns fan (wait until we get to the parts where they try giving Billy the singles push to hear my REAL thoughts...), and I'd love to be a d\*ck and say that The Kliq carried this one, but nope, I'm a fair man, all four guys worked their asses off and put on what is sadly going to be the high point of the show if Meltzer's ratings are to be believed. Is it all downhill from here? We shall see!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, the Kid throws a temper tantrum, shoves Razor away, then dropkicks a celebrating Bart from behind. HE WAS HEEL ALL ALONG DAMNIT! Billy gets a series of kicks of his own for good measure, while Jerry squeals over Kid's antics. Something he has experience with I hear, ahem.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-I don't usually talk about the “Dok Hendrix shills WWF merchandise” bits, but I have to point out here how funny and sad it is that Dok standing next to a cardboard cut out of Bret Hart is the closest we get to see of Bret in action on the PPV proper. He does get a dark match against Yankem, but for fans watching at home, there's no Hart on PPV. A PPV taking place in CANADA, may I remind you. And knowing that he's going to be #1 contender for the World title in a month. Holy sh\*t, this kind of treatment is enough to make a guy want to leave for WCW and hopefully not get screwed in a couple of years!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: MARTY JANNETTY VS GOLDUST

  
For those of you going “Oh hey, it's the WWF debut of Dustin Runnels”, I'd say close but not quite. He actually debuted with the company in 1990, on an episode of Saturday Night's Main Event as a fan in the audience, getting assaulted by Ted Dibiase and Virgil, and wrestled with the company until both he and Dusty left in 1991. This is, however, the debut of the Goldust character, and I'm not going to lie, I LOVE me some Goldust Classic! Actually, I stand corrected, according to the pre-recorded promo played before his entrance, he proclaims it the PREMIERE of Goldust, because this was when his entire gimmick was “androgynous movie guy”, and not “Gay Panic Wrestling Oscar Statue”. I have to say, as much as everyone talks about how The Undertaker has a literally chilling, electrifying entrance (and it's true, I got to see it first hand at a house show in the early 90's), Goldie's entrance ranks right up there with me as being one of the great ones, with the music, the gold lighting, everything, so \*\*\*\*ing great! The match itself is very 1995 WWF, but Motty Jannetty (as Vince keeps pronouncing his name) attacks with fierce intensity, and Goldust bumps his ass off like a champion. I also have to give full credit to Dustin for rocking some absolutely amazing working strikes; his punches and kicks here are absolutely on point, they look snug without being stiff enough to be called potatoes, a very tough balance to find. And then like our opening bout tonight, once we get into the “heel builds heat on the face” portion of the match, everything... slows... to... a... cra...w...l... Marty's selling is on point but yeah, it's another case of “very good to great match being dragged down to good status because of pacing.” It makes me wonder if, when Jinder Mahal was told to study tapes, he spent his time watching Dust and Hunter from this PPV because that's what it reminds me of: very solid work that is made so much less watchable because of how boring and methodical it is. Marty wakes the crowd up with his fired up comeback, starting it with a snapmare from the apron to the floor (with Goldust landing back first on the apron, ouch!), and then slamming Dustin's face onto the steps, reinserting some much needed urgency into the bout, and goes for a bulldog on the floor but gets shot into the ring post at a very rapid pace (also ouch!), Jannetty didn't just hit the post though, he \*\*\*\*ing JUMPED INTO IT like he were Curt Hennig selling a clothesline, holy \*\*\*\*! Back in the ring, Marty starts mounting another comeback, but winds up missing a corner charge and basically dives chest first onto the top turnbuckle, toppling over the top rope, and landing on the apron. \*\*\*\*, dude has NO concern for his personal well being! A THIRD Jannetty comeback spot gives us something we never see: a Jumping Nothing serving a purpose! After hitting a Rocker Dropper (and NOT breaking Dustin's neck, notes broken neck'd jobber Chad Austin, probably), Marty goes up top, Goldust moves, but Marty scouted it out, lands with a Jumping Nothing, and drops a standing elbow onto Dustin! I wish we saw sh\*t like that more often, to give some actual context to why a wrestler would go for a Jumping Nothing: most times it's just the wrestler making a bad read and paying for it! A second Jumping Nothing, however, ends with a boot to the face, and Jannetty gets put away by a Gourdbuster. Huh, I don't remember Goldust using that as a finish, I guess the Curtain Call (which itself would change over time) didn't make it's premiere until later?

  
RESULTS: Goldust def. Jannetty via pinfall

  
MELTZER RATING: \*\*1/2 Sadly, this is the last match of the night that'll get a \*\*+ rating, so... I guess now is where we see whether my tastes differ from Dave's? Good match all around though, if the middle portion would have been sped up a bit, this easily could have been closer to \*\*\*.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Oh no... Oh \*\*\*\*... We're getting recap footage of what led to the Mabel vs Undertaker match being changed to Mabel vs Yokozuna... That can only mean that next match is...  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: KING MABEL (W/ MO) VS YOKOZUNA (W/ JIM CORNETTE AND MR FUJI)

  
Fun fact: if you look carefully, you'll notice that one of the guys carrying Mabel's throne (the one on the front left side of the screen) is a young, clean shaven Rhyno! And that's about all the fun I'll be able to point out in this one probably. Wait, there's also a fun pre-match promo from Cornette, and him referring to Monsoon as “Gorilla Baboon” is pretty hilarious! He's also in full on conspiracy mode here, claiming that Monsoon only made the match to try to create tension and stop the two monsters from being allies and wrecking everyone. Which honestly feels like a very WWE Authority Figure thing to do really. As for the match itself... Okay, let me explain it in the most ludicrous way possible to hammer this home: if you suddenly developed the ability to see noise as an actual visual image, and you looked in the direction of a loud fart noise (shout out to PBR on that one), it would take the shape of this \*\*\*\*ing match. Just two fat guys hitting each other with terribly phony looking punches and forearms, where the most exciting thing to happen is a Mabel fat man flying clothesline. It would have to spend 50 years doing good deeds, accumulating positive karma, then die and become reincarnated just to be elevated to hot garbage status. Actually, I lied, the best spot of the whole match was Mabel going for a bulldog, which Yoko sells by STANDING STILL, stumbling, and falling through the ropes, BAHAHAHA! A+! And the finish is the most #LOLWhat worthy thing we're likely to see on the card! Mabel follows Yokozuna to the floor, but gets thrown into the turnbuckle post. Meanwhile, off screen, Mo takes Cornette down, Yoko goes to check on him but TRIPS ON NOTHING AND FALLS ON CORNEY, and by the time the ref has hit what is usually a 3 count, he's declared this a 10 count and a double count out. Like I said, a loud fart noise that has taken the visual form of a “wrestling” “match”. At least it was short, clocking in at just over 5 minutes of fat men inaction? Er, I mean, in action? No, I was right the first time...

  
RESULTS: No Contest due to Double Count Out

  
MELTZER RATING: -\*\* (Worst Match of the Night) As you've probably heard me say before, I don't usually agree with giving a negative rating to something that the crowd is clearly into, because it means the match is working on SOME level. And the crowd WAS into this one. But holy \*\*\*\*, even that crowd reaction didn't accomplish more than make me say “Well, they saved it from being a -\*\*\*\*\* match”. I hear that if you play this backwards, it becomes Omega vs Okada at NJPW Dominion 2018.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, both men have a staredown in the ring, and take turns threatening each other's managers, but in the end heel fellowship prevails and the two large men hug it out. AWWWWWW! (Note: I would have rather watched them hugging it out for five minutes instead of that farce they called a “match” we just witnessed.)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-And now we get to the pinnacle of Dean Douglas' WWF career: winning the IC title by FORFEIT! May he enjoy a long, prosperous title reign, ahem. Michaels is sporting a visible shiner here (as befitting a guy who got beaten up by X number of Marines), and looks like he hasn't shaved for a week or so, but more tellingly, he looks like he lost his smile, a full year and a halfish before he would make that claim! After what feels like 5 years of holding and staring at the title, HBK finally hands it off, looking very sad, but probably smirking to himself internally over finding a way to lose the title without actually losing it.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
5: IC TITLE MATCH: DEAN DOUGLAS (C) VS RAZOR RAMON

  
So now, Douglas gets to defend HBK's IC title against HBK's good friend and Kliq member. BOY, I SURE LIKE HIS CHANCES HERE! If you ever wanted to see two talented workers have the most boring match possible, then this is the one for you! Seriously, Scott Hall is one of the great big man workers of the 90's, Douglas himself would prove to be a very talented hand in ECW, and for some reason they get shoehorned into the most 1995 WWF kicky punchy chinlocky snoozer of a match possible. Don't get me wrong, it's basically Steamboat/Flair compared to the match preceding it, but to give you an idea of what we're in for here... You know how the usual WWF/E formula is that the babyface gets his shine spot with fired up offense, the heel takes control with slow, boring, methodical sh\*t to build heat, and then the babyface makes an exciting, fired up comeback before they go home? This match says “nuts to the formula” and sees Razor working that opening face shine segment working like he were a heel, with slow, methodical, slow, boring, slow limb work. Neither man seems to give a \*\*\*\* here, and to be honest, neither does the crowd; they pop for a big Razor fallaway slam, and any time Razor turns the match around, but on the most part the audience is just kind of sitting on their hands, and sounding like the muted audience in the old pre-recorded Smackdown days. So yeah, the match is well worked in terms of believable looking offense and good bumping, but it is SO... DAMN... BORING! When the most exciting spot to happen all match is Razor stealing a bottle of water from the announce table and dumping it on Dean's head, you know you got problems! Even the spot where Razor countered a Jumping Nothing with a chokeslam lost a lot of the impact it should have had, thanks to Douglas getting maybe a foot and a half off of the mat at best. And it all builds to a tired trope of a finish: an exhausted Razor hits Douglas with a back suplex and is barely able to drape his arm across Dean's chest. Douglas manages to get his foot under the bottom rope, but the ref doesn't see it, and SOMEHOW a member of the Kliq managed to win a title! If you ever wondered why Douglas has nothing but the most vile things possible to say about the Kliq, look no further than this whole IC title scenario for Exhibit A.

  
RESULTS: Ramon def. Douglas via (tainted) pinfall

  
MELTZER RATINGS: \* Sounds about right to me, this was a match that happened, and that's probably the nicest thing I can say.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-It looks like I was wrong earlier when I joked that the cardboard cutout of Bret Hart was the only time we'd see him on the PPV (unless you were there live to see his dark match against Yankem), because he's out to do guest commentary for our main event/chase Lawler away from the announce table because he still hates his guts over their past history, and/or attempted cheating in last week's cage match. Hitman is here because he'll be facing the winner of the match in a month at Survivor Series, and because in 1995, he's a real ace at talking. One of those isn't even a lie!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
5: MAIN EVENT - WORLD TITLE MATCH: BRITISH BULLDOG (W/JIM CORNETTE) VS DIESEL

  
If you ever wanted to know who's basket Vince McMahon had all of his eggs in (not sexual, I swear!), consider this: instead of watching Bulldog's entrance, we cut away to Dok Hendrix shilling Diesel and HBK “Two Dudes With Attitudes” shirts, and the announce team talk about Diesel and Michaels. Meanwhile, Bulldog just kind of exists, but only because the Kliq allow him to do so. So as a bit of an aside, but one that kind of sums up this match, I recently re-read Hitman's autobiography (which I still maintain should have been called “Hey Listen To How Many Women I \*\*\*\*ed”, because that was a massively recurring theme, but I digress), and in talking about Bulldog, he said something to the effect of how Davey was a great worker who could do just about any spot you laid out for him, but had no ability to envision or carry a match on his own. It sounds mean, but then you watch this match, and think that hey, he might have a point. Nash is a good enough in ring storyteller to be able to give this match a central theme - Bulldog knows that if he wants to defeat Diesel, he'll need to chop him down to size (so to speak) by going for the legs - but I can't help but think of how this match might have worked out so much better if Bulldog's opponent were someone who could work or at least call a more dynamic, exciting match. That, of course, is not Kevin Nash's wheelhouse, so yeah, insert your favorite WWF kicky punchy chinlocky (or leg worky in this case) reference here. I did really like the early turning point leading into the heel heat segment though: the action spills outside, Diesel gets rocked by a strike and stumbles towards the announce table. Hart, being the Lawful Good paladin type he is, puts his hands on Diesel's back to help prop him up/prevent him from falling, and Diesel responds by putting his hand on Hart's face and pushing him down. A d\*ck move, but he gets immediate comeuppance by not noticing an incoming Bulldog chopblock. OOPS! So yeah, the match is boring, but there's at least a strong in ring story being told here, which elevates it to being watchable at least. It's also structured in such a way that makes the bigger Diesel actually look like an underdog who's in danger of losing, and providing a logical reason for Bulldog being able to control the match against someone who is physically his superior, so I give it a thumbs up there. It all builds to such a gloriously sh\*tty match finish befitting of the Kliq, and their unwillingness to lose matches by laying down for their opponents! Once again, the action spills outside, only this time it's Bulldog who winds up near the announce table. For reasons known only to him, he just randomly slugs Hart and tries to get back into the ring, but Hart is hot on his heels and starts attacking him ground and pound style for the DQ finish. WOMP WOMP! Post-match, Diesel and Hart slug it out in the ring, causing a flood of officials and undercard wrestlers to rush the ring to separate the two, while the crowd boos and boos and boos. As a fun closing note, if I remember correctly, I think this was the match Bret mentioned in his book where, after the show went off the air, Vince tossed his headset down in disgust and chewed Diesel out immediately after.

  
RESULTS: Bulldog def. Diesel via disqualification

  
MELTZER RATING: \* I'm not sure how I feel about this. Before the lame duck ending, I was thinking this might actually be closer to a \*\* affair, just because of the in ring storytelling, and how much the crowd was into it. The sh\*t finish definitely dragged that opinion down for me. Either way, it wasn't exactly the kind of match you'd want to watch more than once, probably but still, \* feels a bit low to me.  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
PPV BUYRATE: 0.4 To put into perspective what terrible business this show did, I went through the buyrates for every PPV from The Wrestling Classic in 1985 until this one, and IYH 4 was legit the lowest buyrate in company history up until that point. It's not completely shocking, in that the IYH shows never fared as well as the Big 4, but bare in mind that this is down from 0.7 just one month prior. And spoiler alert: it only keeps its status as “worst buyrate in company history” for two whole months. HOW did the WWF even stay in business long enough to topple WCW in 2001?!?!?! All kidding aside though, yeah, the lucky ones were the folks who DIDN'T spend their hard earned money to watch a show that had a pretty fun undercard but went downhill WAY too quickly.  


  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: As a spoiler, my picks for highlight and lowlight both fall in line with Meltzer's ratings, so you can already tell where I'm going with these. That tag title match was far and away the best thing on the show, and realistically speaking, is one of only two matches worth watching (the other being Fatu/Hunter) for reasons beyond “historic importance”. Everything else on the card was either bad or forgettable, but nothing exemplifies this more than...  


  
LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: If you thought it wasn't going to be Yokozuna/Mabel, then I don't even know what the \*\*\*\* to tell you. Aside from the terrible finish and laughable bulldog spot, this wasn't even that special kind of bad that virtually everything on Uncensored '95 wound up being, where I can enjoy it on an ironic level due to how much laughter it caused me. No, this match was just... atrocious! One of the worst I've ever covered!  


  
NEXT WEEK: We're finally at the go-home show for WCW Halloween Havoc '95, and holy sh\*t do I kind of want to skip next week and get right to the PPV! But Nitro will feature Luger and Sting in tag team action, taking on former champions Harlem Heat and their endless assortment of \*\*\*\* finishes, probably. And what's inside of the giant block of ice (that appears to be housing a glowing red penis inside of it?) that Kevin Sullivan refers to as his “insurance package” (yes, that one IS an intentional penis joke, I think his real wording was “insurance policy”)? You'll have to tune in to find out! Meanwhile over on Raw, Razor needs a new challenger for his IC title, and this #1 contender will be determined by a 20 man battle royal! This is funny to me because (1) a 20 man battle royal is how Razor won his first chance at the IC title to begin with, back when he was still heel; (2) If this were happening in 2018, they would have scrapped the 20 man battle royal and made it a 6 way match. And done it every single month!

PART 1 - WCW MONDAY NITRO 10/23/1995  


  
1: “MACHO MAN” RANDY SAVAGE VS KUROSAWA (W/COL. ROBERT PARKER)

  
Okay, so remember how a few weeks back, Kurosawa (a young Manabu Nakanishi for those keeping score) had a low key short classic bout with Sgt. Craig Pittman? Well, despite the fact that he's up against a much higher caliber opponent here, this match might be the polar opposite of that one! The first clue should have been the fact that Kurosawa got the good ole jobber entrance. Woo...hoo? But yeah, what we get here is the most 80's WWF jobber squash possible: it's like 90% Kurosawa controlling with “back leg round kicks” (Eric Bischoff LOVED using way too specific martial arts terms!) to the legs, then trying to hurt Savage's apparently injured arm with standing arm wrenches and strikes. He does get in a nice Water Wheel Suplex at some point, but yeah, mostly kicks, forearms, and hopping in place while holding Savage's wrist. Savage gets a couple of minor licks in here and there, but this is all Kurosawa right up until the end: Savage reverses an attempted arm breaker by gingerly running towards the ropes with Kurosawa in tow, causing the Japanese man's throat to lightly hit the ropes, then connects with a Northern Lariat. As Bischoff proclaims that that this is the first time in the match where Savage was in control, he's going up top to land the Big Elbow and wins the match because essentially, it was time to win the match, and not because of any real work that built up to that finish being even remotely logical. Two things here: (1) Apparently Kurosawa's big mistake was targeting the injured left arm, because Randy's right arm is capable of winning matches in two \*\*\*\*ing moves; (2) I'd like to image that before going out, Savage was pulled aside by Hogan and told “Brother, just wrestle this match like you were me dude!” 

  
RESULTS: Savage def. Kurosawa via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-HOW SH\*T, HERE WE GO! While the commentary team is talking about surprisingly non-Hulk Hogan stuff, the lights go out, and tonight's episode of Dungeon Of Doom's Disasterpiece Theater kicks off with a YELLING AND SCREAMING LUNATIC known as The Master introducing Kevin Sullivan's insurance policy for Halloween Havoc. For those of you not up on your Dungeon of Doom lore (and for your own sanity's sake, I hope that's most of you), The Master is noted old timer retired wrestler “King” Curtis Iaukea, who was legendary for his mic skills and gross forehead that looks like it had been badly bladed about 5 million times. Here he is Sullivan's father, and also... I think some kind of mystic sorcerer who fell into a vat of flour? I don't know, but he's basically the Emperor to Sullivan's Darth Vader, if the Sith were Hanna Barbara cartoon villains. He also lives in a mystical, icy cave with water that's so cold, even Hogan can't believe that “IT'S NOT HOT!” So what is the insurance policy, you surely must all be asking? It turns out to be “a 13 tons of ice” (????) dug out from the Himalayan mountains, and containing what looks like a glowing red penis inside of it. Note: not to spoil 20 year old wrestling, but given what happens at the climax of Halloween Havoc, this penis joke is more appropos than you'd think. And just in case you think I'm lying about it, BEHOLD:  
r/https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/yeti-rock.png?w=650&amp;h=492  


&amp;#x200B;

  
There, that ought to prove my trustworthiness about batsh\*t insane wrestling stuff, and this is key, because the next month or so of WCW programming makes this look like Lou Thesz vs Buddy Rogers level of normal by comparison.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Because this hasn't been stupid enough, Kevin Sullivan and The Giant are on hand to continue to try and explain just what this iceberg is, and somehow managing to not only NOT answer any questions we might have, but also leaving us with dozens of extra questions afterwards. Like they're using English words, but I don't think any sentence Sullivan uses makes any sense to anyone, including himself.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Welp, because we didn't have enough batsh\*t insane horsesh\*t talking segments between matches, here's Hulk Hogan Black to cut a promo completely no selling all of the danger he is supposedly in, and trying to create religious symbolism around himself by (mis)quoting Bible verses while discussing himself. He also rips the neckbrace off from his (may I remind you) TWICE BROKEN NECK, and threatens to SHOOT MURDER The Giant by dragging him behind his motorcycle until he DISINTEGRATES, and THEN tells his FRIENDS (Luger, Sting, and Savage) that after he's done with The Giant, they need to get in line and decide which of them Hogan's going to murder as well! Holy \*\*\*\*... It's like Hogan decided that he not only had to be the best hero on the show, but also the biggest villain, all at the same time!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: CHRIS BENOIT AND DEAN MALENKO VS EDDIE GUERRERO AND MR JL (W/ALEX WRIGHT)

  
OH THANK \*\*\*\*ING GAWD, THE LITTLE GUYS ARE HERE! Because I love numbered non-sequitor lists, two things here: (1) Wright was supposed to be teaming with Eddie here, but he apparently injured his knee, and is out with crutches as a second instead; (2) replace JL with the not-yet-with-the-company Perry Saturn, and this would be all of The Radicalz in one match. Oh, and a third thing: (3) Eric Bischoff's call of “MR JL? Is that like ET? What's THAT about?” is somehow both the worst attempt to get a wrestler over on commentary, and also the best thing he could have said, ever. I wish I had a ton more to say about the match beyond “THIS IS SUPER GOOD!”, but sh\*t, the worst thing I can say about the match itself is that Benoit makes me both cringe and feel sad to have to type “Benoit misses his target, and accidentally MURDERS HIS PARTNER with a SUICIDE dive” (key trigger words in upper case for comedic effect!) We get good technical wrestling, we get high flying, we get a truncated “Everybody dives!” segment, it's basically a 2018 indies darling WWE match, except only in 1995, and with more psychology and selling! All it's missing is a distraction rollup finish, ahem... Of course, because it's WCW and we aren't allowed to have nice things, there's always some “great” extraneous sh\*t going on that's clearly far more important than watching great non-Hogan action, and this match is no difference, as we cut to the world's smallest split screens in order to see that backstage, The Shark and Scott Norton are engaged in fisticuffs! Oh my, this is CLEARLY more important than watching an awesome match! In a retroactively (and out of context) hilarious moment, Bischoff declares that this fight is “evidently left over from September 11th”, and while he is referencing the fact that Shark's fatness caused Norton to lose a match, it's 10 times funnier to assume that Norton thinks that residents of Tsunami are somehow allied with Al Qaeda. Anyhow, the match! Although it doesn't end with a distraction rollup, we do get the most 2018 WWE tropey finish possible: Wright (who I remind you is managing the team that's working babyface here) trips Malenko with his crutches, which gives JL a chance to land a victory roll and pick up the win, and is explained away by Bischoff as basically “Turnabout is fairplay!”, despite the fact that the closest thing that the future Horsemen did to cheating was behind-the-ref double teaming once or twice. WCW BABYFACES EVERYONE!

  
RESULTS: JL/Guerrero def. Benoit/Malenko (JL pinned Malenko)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, Brian Pillman steps out to attack Guerrero, DDT him on the floor, and make Horseman hands, because... Reasons? Did The Loose Cannonr realize that one day both Benoit AND Malenko would become Four Horsemen and was getting revenge? Bischoff sells the attack in the most Bischoff manner possible: “We'll be right back, we're going to have more action, we're going to talk about Hogan!” Nailed it!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: MAIN EVENT: HARLEM HEAT (W/SISTER SHERRI) VS STING AND LEX LUGER

  
Hooboy, during the ring entrances, Bischoff gets the commentary team into full mocking WWF mode, leading to this Mongo gem: “In Your House? Don't you mean In Your Outhouse?” Which proves that Mongo watched the show, because he's not wrong! You know, I never noticed it until it was brought up in Hogan's rambly religious/death threat promo, but he was right about one thing: not only is Sting wearing the Hogan red and yellow here, but he's also growing a really sh\*tty looking Hogan style Fu Manchu. If he wins this match by no selling Harlem Heat's finish, hitting his big moves, and winning, then maybe Hogan is onto something and Sting SHOULDN'T be trusted? Anyhow, what we get here is perfectly acceptable (if not exceptional) tag team wrestling made all the less important by the fact that the commentary team would rather talk about that block of ice that houses what is now identified as The Yeti (or The Yet-TAY as Bischoff, and later Schiavone call it); Heenan says that obviously it's some kind of Bigfoot monster, but what we get instead is... We'll get there soon, but hold onto your butts, it's gonna be WCW stupid! I find it hilarious that throughout the match, GIANT MUSCULAR Lex Luger is the one playing face in peril here, you'd think he'd be the one standing on the apron and cleaning house, given how Sting is both the better worker and the better seller of the two. Huh. Luger's hot tag comes off of avoiding the best move performed in the whole match, Booker T's Harlem Hangover, and man... 20+ years after the fact and I still think that move in an incredible spectacle. A big ass, muscular dude going up top and going “Legdrop? Nah, I gotta do a front flip into that sh\*t”, just so \*\*\*\*ing cool! The finish comes completely out of nowhere, but is a really good example of a crafty veteran taking advantage of a rookie mistake: after the hot tag comeback segment, Sting gets dumped to the floor, and both members of the Heat double team Luger. When Booker turns around (leaving Stevie to assault Luger), he learns all too late that Sting is up on the top ropes, gets hit with a flying clothesline, and pinned before Stevie has a chance to register what's happening and make the save, awesome stuff there.

  
RESULTS: Sting and Luger def. Harlem Heat (Sting pinned Booker)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-And now, our Penis Rock (thanks to Brandon Stroud for that nickname) related goofy payoff! As soon as the match ends, Sullivan and Giant hit the ring and both of Hogan's mortal enemies (Sting and Luger, naturally, based on that promo) get chokeslams for their troubles. Savage is out next, he clears Sullivan from the ring, but before he and Giant can get into it, Hogan ALSO runs out to face the big man. Hogan hits Giant but gets no sold. Giant clubs Hogan's twice broken neck, it is briefly sold... for 2 seconds maybe. If this is a preview of Halloween Havoc, then I shudder to think of how many people canceled their PPV orders based on the sheer workrate being showcased here, ahem. The rest of the Dungeon of Doom run in to attack Hogan, and he SINGLE HANDEDLY FIGHTS THE ENTIRE FACTION OFF and holy \*\*\*\* I wish I were making that up! Savage joins the fray as well, and essentially gives us an accidental preview of the Uncensored '96 main event. And then, the best moment of the show (in the same way that The Room is the “best” “comedy” film of its time): the giant d\*ck inside of the giant block of ice begins glowing faster, the block of ice EXPLODES, and inside of it is A GIANT \*\*\*\*ING MUMMY! Who we get to see for HALF OF A SECOND before we go off the air, right in the middle of Bischoff going “WHAT IS THAT?!?!?!” REALLY?!?!?! THIS is how you decided to end your go home show?!?!?! To quote myself on a nearly weekly basis, #LOLWhat?!?!?! No, that's not enough... #LOLOLOLOLOLWHAAAAAAAAAT?!?!?!?!?!?!

&amp;#x200B;

  
PART 2 - WWF MONDAY NIGHT RAW 10/23/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: 20 MAN BATTLE ROYAL

  
The winner of this thing gets a title shot at the Intercontinental belt, and is full of the most jobtastic dudes who would probably never ever get a chance at the title otherwise, as well as some legit midcard talent. Some of whom would go on to much greater success later in their careers. WILL THIS BE ALDO MONTOYA'S NIGHT? LET'S FIND OUT! Because I don't give deep reviews of battle royals in general - especially 1995 kicky punchy WWF stuff, where regular matches are about as athletic as a \*\*\*\*ing battle royal anyway - I'll just run through the list of eliminations in order, and mention anything notable about them.

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Before we get to the battle royal results, both Sid and Marty Janetty cut pretty basic “I'm gonna win” pre-recorded promos. Well, Marty's was basic, Sid was the usual case of Sid speaking in pure nonsense goodness.

  
\-King Kong Bundy (who I didn't even know was still with the \*\*\*\*ing company here), gets taken out first due to the trope of “everyone gang up on the big man”, like 15 seconds into the match, by the tandem of Bam Bam Bigelow, Duke “The Dumpster” Droese (WRESTLING GARBAGEMAN!), Fatu, Henry Godwin, and Rad Radford (the late Louis Spicolli)

  
\-Aldo Montoya (guess he didn't win after all)

  
\-Bob Holly (WRESTLING RACE CAR DRIVER, his friends call him SPARKY!)

  
\-Duke Droese

  
\-Hakushi, who gets taken out by his good friend Barry Horrowitz's mortal foe Skip

  
\-Skip, who funny enough gets eliminated by Horowitz, making this not only a great revenge elimination, but yet another case of poor Candido jobbing to a lifelong jobber. It also triggers a great “HOROWITZ WINS! HOROWITZ WINS!” cry from Vince that legit popped me!

  
\-Fatu, who didn't get much of a chance to “Make A Difference”

  
\-Henry Godwin, who somehow needed to be taken out by the tandem of Jean-Pierre LaFitte and the future GAWD DAMN KANE, guess we needed to protect Wrestling Pig Farmer!

  
\-Rad Radford

  
\-Kama Mustafa, current Wrestling MMA-ish Guy and future pimp

  
\-Barry Horowitz

  
\-Hunter Hearst Helmsley

  
\-1-2-3 Kid, thus denying us yet another Kid vs Razor match

  
\-Isaac Yankem, who was eliminated by a guy who's twice the man he is, and has half the brains that he does (Gawd bless Sid)

  
\-Speaking of which, Sid goes next

  
\-Bam Bam Bigelow

  
\-Savio Vega

  
\-Jean-Pierre LaFitte

  
\-And lastly, Marty Janetty gets taken out by Owen Hart, who's one elimination is the most important one! 

&amp;#x200B;

I have to say, the final four stretch with Vega, LaFitte, Janetty and Hart was really fun, and the final Hart/Janetty stretch was exceptional batle royal work, with lots of fun near-elimination spots, with Owen literally barely holding on to his chances at victory while getting continually slugged on the apron. Also, Marty still got to look strong in defeat here because he only lost due to going through the middle ropes, trying to beat up Cornette on the floor, then getting assaulted by the British Bulldog and tossed back into the ring. I may not do deep reviews of battle royals, but I've always had a soft spot for them in my heart, and I enjoyed this a lot.

  
\-One final note: I would KILL to have a battle royal take place in the Bill Watts era of WCW. How would you even win when tossing someone over the top ropes = DQ?

&amp;#x200B;

  
RESULTS: Owen Hart is now your new #1 contender to the IC title  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Jerry Lawler gets a post-victory interview with Owen, and I can't think of a sentence that makes me happier to type than this. He doesn't have much to say besides “I'm gonna beat you Razor”, but at this point in his career he's great on the mic so it still comes out very awesome. Plus he co-opts Bret's “Best there is/was/ever will be” catchphrase, which is always a plus. I don't say this often enough, but I think Owen might legit be my favorite wrestler to never win the WWF World title, and going back and rewatching these old WWF shows just reinforces my lifelong love of his work.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-I don't usually cover Dok Hendrix Slam Jams, but in discussing Survivor Series, it's revealed that one of the traditional 8 man tag matches will be a Wildcard match, where faces will team with heels! PREPOSTEROUS! They don't outright say that it's faces and heels working together of course but still, holy sh\*t! If 1997 was when Vince basically killed kayfabe, then surely this was an instance of him trying to stab it in the heart, but, like, only getting the shoulder or something.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Bob Backlund is back! He's in the audience, and he's trying to campaign for his new goal of RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OFTHE USA! Bob Backlund as pro wrestling psychopath Ross Perot is low key one of my favorite wrestling characters of this era, I'm not even going to front. I loved it as a teen, I think I love it even more as an adult.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Speaking of things I love as an adult, this one for all of the wrong reasons, here's Ahmed Johnson cutting a promo! I'd tell you what he said, but neither Duolingo or Rosetta Stone have courses for learning Ahmed Johnsonese yet. I THINK he opens by saying “Don't even sweat it G”, but it comes out sounding like “Do-ee-en sweya G”, if that gives you any indication. I've said it before and I'll say it again: he makes Shinsuke Nakamura sound like \*\*\*\*ing Bill Regal by comparison, and it's the best! For all of the wrong reasons!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: AVATAR VS SOME JOBBER

  
BAHAHAHAHAHA! Okay, so Avatar... Holy \*\*\*\*, where the \*\*\*\* do I even \*\*\*\*ing begin here? Take talented journeyman wrestler Al Snow, give him a not-at-all Hayabusha-esque (ahem) masked martial artist gimmick, and then have him come out NOT WEARING THE MASK, but holding it in his hand, only putting it on AFTER he gets to the ring, and... #LOLWhat?!?!?!?! It's like Cien Almas' awesome La Sombra unmasking entrance but in reverse! This is nothing more than a jobber squash, as well as what looks to me like a VERY watered down attempt at doing WCW's Cruiserweight division. Spoiler alert: it doesn't come nearly close to that high benchmark. We do get to see Avatar run up to the top turnbuckle, and attempt to splash the hapless jobber who's on the floor, but lose his footing, fall back to the mat, and just do a regular springboard plancha, so there's that? Avatar picks up the win by standing on his jobber foe's belly, and splashing him, which is somehow both kinda lame, but also a pretty cool move at the same time. He also removes his mask again after winning, so yeah, no idea what the \*\*\*\* is up with that.

  
RESULTS: Avatar def. Jobber via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: MAIN EVENT - WOMEN'S TITLE MATCH: BERTHA FAYE (C) (W/HARVEY WIPPLEMAN) VS ALUNDRA BLAYZE

  
The next time you have to sit through the WWE's new fangled revisionist history about women's wrestling, bear this in mind: 9 years before Lita and Trish Stratus would do the same, and like 20 years before Stephanie MacMahon would invent women, wrestling, and women's wrestling by kicking off the Women's Revolution, we have an episode of Raw being main evented by a women's match. Bertha Faye, as I mentioned last week, is Rhonda Singh, who worked primarily in Stampede and Japan (she worked under the awesome name MONSTER RIPPER in the latter territory!), doing kind of a Wrestling Roseanne Barr gimmick. And Blayze is the former and future Madusa, a few months removed from showing up on Nitro, dropping a belt into a trashcan, and essentially kickstarting the Monday Night Wars into gear. Also, damn, I had no idea that Faye even held the title here, which probably isn't a good sign for how this match is going to go, given that I can't remember anything about this. So here's the question I have: when discussing watershed moments for women's wrestling, how come the WWF doesn't ever mention this 1995 Raw main event? Because damn, for a match I was kind of dreading a sentence ago, this actually kinda \*\*\*\*ing RULED! Strip away the trailer trash gimmick and garish polka dot tights, and Faye could GO for a big girl, with great, super hossy offense. This is like a low budget version of Blayze vs Bull Nakano, sure, but a VERY GOOD low budget production. If two women could have put on a match like this anytime from, like, 1996 until 2013 or 14, we would have been losing our Gawddamn minds. Just, um, pay no attention to the white male commentary team being basically like “She's fat” (Vince), and “She's kinda fat, but I'd still \*\*\*\* her if she were 13 years younger!” (Lawler) (He doesn't actually bring the age thing up, but with Lawler, the low age number is ALWAYS implied). But yeah, after getting whipped like an underdog for a good chunk of the match, Blayze fires up, begins fighting from underneath and makes the big babyface comeback, and the crowd is way more into good women's wrestling in 1995 than I would have expected. Blayze is able to thwart attempted cheating, escaping the grasp of Wippleman (who was on the apron), and dodging a charge from Bertha at the last minute. This stuns Fays, and Blayze lands a great German Suplex for the win AND the title change. Damn... I went into this with low expectations, but this was one of the better Raw matches I've covered so far. Better than anything not involving Bret or Owen at least.

  
RESULTS: Blayze def. Faye via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Our REAL main event is Jim Ross sitting down to interview the depressed looking, hobo beard wearing version of HBK that is basically the prototype to “I lost my smile” Michaels. He doesn't seem to think that him getting beaten up by 9 guys is a big deal (because I'm sure it wasn't like he \*\*\*\*ing deserved it due to excessive d\*ckbaggery), but hated having to relinquish the IC title. Which might be the truest thing he says here. And then there's this retroactively hilarious line: “I've got two choices: sit home and cry, or come back and be a pain.” Let's remember these words in 1997, ahem.  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
TV RATINGS: Nitro def. Raw 2.6 to 2.2. I can see that, what with Nitro being the go home show, and honestly putting on what was, top to bottom, the more intriguing show. Don't get me wrong, Raw didn't have anything bad besides that jobber squash, and that main event was top shelf, but WCW threw out a strong combination of good wrestling and the most mind numbingly absurd and entertaining sh-t possible. Still, both shows were strong this week, I felt.  


  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: You know me well enough by now to know that, as impressed as I was by Raw's main event, and despite the random bullsh\*t cutaway, this is going to Benoit/Malenko vs Guerrero/JL, it was always going to be that, wasn't it? That one match alone featured 3 of the most bullet proof workers in Nitro history all in the same segment, how could it NOT be the best?  


  
LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: Funny enough, the first segment I covered was easily the worst. Avatar vs Jobber may have been a short, somewhat sloppy faux Cruiserweight affair, but it was Dynamite Kid vs the Sayama version of Tiger Mask compared to the tale of “Randy Savage gets killed for 5 minutes then wins with two moves”.   


  
NEXT WEEK: FINALLY we are at Halloween Havoc 95! Have you ever wanted to see a PPV that featured such things as monster trucks having a sumo match, a shoot murder getting no sold, and the literal sodomizing of Hulkamania? I assure you, I am making NONE OF THIS UP! This show might cause me to lose several points of IQ, but I am SO STOKED to write about it!

WCW HALLOWEEN HAVOC 10/29/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Note: Ahhhhh, the refreshing two man commentary team of Schiavone and Heenan returns! This should at least make what is going to be an unmitigated sh\*t show seem more palatable, right? Also, for some reason, both Hogan and Giant are already on the rooftop of Kobo Hall playing MONSTER TRUCKS in preparation for their MONSTER TRUCK SUMO MATCH! I was not lying or joking, THIS IS A THING THAT IS HAPPENING! Also ALSO, we learn that Ric Flair was... GASP! Attacked sometime prior to the show starting - possibly the Greatest Attack In The History Of Our Sport? - and his ability to team with Sting is up in the air now! I'm sure it'll all work out fine in the end.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: WCW TV TITLE MATCH: DDP (W/THE DIAMOND DOLL AND MAXX MUSCLE) (C) VS JOHNNY B. BADD

  
It's a good thing for Badd that he is (spoiler alert) WWF bound within a couple of months because here he's already showing his chops as a d\*ckbag WWF babyface: His “awesome” music (that sounds like the Saved By The Bell theme song, and contains “clever” “well written” lines like “He's as pretty as a picture! He looks just like Little Richard!”) plays, and he makes his way out in a not-at-all-suspicious manner, with his back turned to the ring, his face hidden from the camera. But wait a minute, it's a fake! The REAL JBB comes out of the audience and attacks Page from behind! Man, Page is an absolute bumping machine here, selling Badd's fired up offense like he were Curt Hennig, and making me rethink my entire narrative of “DDP was terrible until mid 1996 or so”. Likewise, I once again have to rethink my narrative of “Marc Mero was the sh\*ts” because man... During the last PPV, he and Pillman put on an incredible classic, and while this match isn't as good, it's still a really damn good match! Albeit one that was probably rehearsed 4 million times, if I know how Page operates. Schiavone actually brings up a plot point that I ABSOLUTELY forgot about, and will actually make some of the Diamond Doll's actions over the next few months make more sense: not only is the Diamond Doll upset with Page for that heinous assault on Badd during a recent episode of Nitro, apparently DDP won 13 MILLION DOLLARS in the lottery, but gasp, it turns out that the ticket MAY have actually been KIMBERLEY'S! WHAT A HEEL! So there's some friction (and not the good kind, ahem) going on between the Diamond Themed Couple. So much friction that when Page finally takes control of the match and demands that the Doll hold up his proto-Tye Dillinger 10 judge card, she REFUSES TO! When she does eventually hold up the 10 sign for a DDP back suplex, the look on her face clearly tells us that she disagrees with her own rating. And once Badd makes his own comeback, he signals for the 10 after hitting a Flying Axe Handle, and Doll does just that, with a smile on her face! The finishing stretch of the match has some great spots, I have to say, including Badd countering a Diamond Cutter by hooking his arm around the top rope (that's ring awareness you NEVER see anymore!), and Maxx Muscle getting taken out not once, but TWICE - the first time off of a big dive that wipes out both heels, the second being when he gets up on the apron to hold Badd in place for a Page punch. Badd moves, Page stops short before he hits his own henchman, in a rare moment of recognition that things didn't go as planned... but oops, he gets dropkicked from behind and takes out Muscle anyway! The finish plays off of that last spot, as Muscle once again gets up on the apron, and this time DDP holds Badd in place. Maxx goes for a clothesline, Badd moves, and unlike his employer, Muscle does NOT stop short, dropping DDP to the mat, and Badd picks up the win and the title!

  
RESULTS: Badd def. Page via pinfall

  
MELTZER RATING: \*\*\* This seems right to me, and is kind of a great sleeper classic in my eyes. Page was everything that a classic Southern heel needed to be: a falsely confident bully who still relies on outside help and cheating when in control, a complete chickensh\*t when on defense, and willing to bump and sell like a madman. Badd played the role of the Tommy Rich type babyface perfectly as well, knowing when to fire up and when to sell and build sympathy, making several false comebacks only to get cut off and build that extra heat, and finally make the hot comeback proper. I wish I could assure you all that this match is a good indication of how great the PPV is going to be, but... you know... Monster truck sumo matches and mummies.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: ZODIAC VS “MACHO MAN” RANDY SAVAGE

  
“From the Land of Yin And Yang... ZODIAC!” #LOLWhat?!?!?! That makes “From Tsunami” sound like “From Detroit, Michigan” by comparison! Note: I accidentally typo'd that as “Detrout, Michigan”, and holy \*\*\*\*, Detrout would be an AWESOMELY terrible hometown for an aquatic themed wrestler like Shark! Anyhow, to recap why this match (and the later match between Luger and Meng) is “important”, both Luger and Savage have matches with members of the Dungeon Of Doom tonight, but also SUPER HATE EACH OTHER because WCW Babyfaces' default state is “I DON'T TRUST YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE WITH THIS EVIL FACTION MAYBE!” It gets even worse when the nWo shows up. Sting's “intelligent” “well thought out” plan is to set up a small, “start at the semi finals” tournament of sorts: if Savage beats Zodiac, and if Luger beats Meng (LOL at the word “if” in those statements), then they will face each other! Sure, that'll help things? The reason I'm spending so much time talking about the backstory is so that I don't have to talk about 1995 Savage taking on ANY era Brutus the \*\*\*\*ing Barber Beefcake cosplaying a \*\*\*\*ing zebra. Luckily, there's really not much to talk about here, as the most exciting thing to happen is a fan jumping into the ring after a few punches are thrown, and getting subdued while Savage hits Zodiac with the most 80's WWF safe, boring offense for like a minute. Just a lot of bad punches, and phony slams against the barricade while they're out on the floor. Then Zodiac gets in one bodyslam, thinks that's enough offense to justify going up top for a splash, misses, and Savage wins with the Big Elbow. 

  
RESULTS: Savage def. Zodiac via pinfall

  
MELTZER RATING: (DUD) Sounds about right, at least they kept it short?  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Mean Gene is backstage shilling the WCW Hotline, and I only bring it up because he mentions that he'll be joined by both Mike Tenay (YAY), and Mark Madden, thus making me CRINGE about the name “Mark Madden” long before that \*\*\*\*ing moron shows up on weekly commentary. “Geez Intern, tell us how you REALLY feel about the guy?” He also gets an interview with Badd, who... and this is Hotline worthy news... is happy that he won a title! He also gives an inspirational “Kids, you can achieve your dreams, I am living proof!” speech, and lies to the fans by saying that he's never going to quit WCW. Stay tuned for the next couple of months to see him prove himself wrong!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: KUROSAWA (W/COL. ROBERT PARKER) VS HAWK

  
This is billed as a “revenge match”, and for good reason: at a recent Clash of the Champions card (sometime before the scope of my coverage), Kurosawa attacked Hawk after a tag match, locked him in a very early version of the Disarmer, and then went full proto-Pentagon Jr, “breaking” his arm by falling back, essentially doing the Hammerlock Arm Breaker minus the hammerlock part. Wait, is Robert Parker just Kurosawa's Miestro? His Dark Master to whom he needs to sacrifice arm bones? So, do you know what's more stupid than putting a 3 minute squash on a PPV? Putting a 3 minute squash where THE ONE DOING THE SQUASHING ACTUALLY LOSES THE MATCH onto a PPV! Seriously, for two minutes of this, Kurosawa does exactly two things: dodge a Hawk charge to the corner (which gets no sold immediately), and fall on his back a lot. He does eventually get in some offense thanks to Parker holding Hawk's foot, Parker gets a clothesline for his troubles, Hawk gets sent into the ring post, hit with a Samoan Drop and it takes a combination of slamming a man's face into metal, Kurosawa putting his feet up on the ropes, AND Parker holding Kurosawa's feet for stability for him to get the 3. Hawk is up at 3.1, at 100% HP, because of course he is, and I guess the best kind of revenge is... losing?

  
RESULTS: Kurosawa def. Hawk via pinfall

  
MELTZER RATING: \* I think the one thing saving this from being a (DUD) in my books was the opening minute of the match, Hawk was striking with a modern Strong Style level of intensity, that was pretty \*\*\*\*ing dope.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-More Mean Gene interview time, this time with Savage, and I love his choice words of “We had a little audience participation!” Even better is telling Gene that his mustache is crooked, which cracked me the \*\*\*\* up. Savage tries to hype up his potential upcoming match with Luger, but Gene channels his inner Bischoff by going “Let's not talk about that, let's talk about monster trucks and your Good Friend Hulk Hogan WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HULK HOGAN!” Do you guys remember the episode of The Simpsons where the Itchy and Scratchy Show added Poochie the Rocking Dog? Hulk Hogan is basically the Poochie of WCW: whenever Hogan isn't on screen, all of the other characters should be asking “Where's HOGAN?”  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: MR JL VS SABU (W/THE SHEIK)

  
As a quick note, The Sheik coming out with Sabu here is his uncle, Ed Farhat, the long time local promoter of Big Time Wrestling in the Detroit area. Not the Sheik who wants to \*\*\*\* a Killer Bee in the ass. Big difference between those two beyond one using the word “Iron” in his name. Sheik may be old and decrepit here, but he lives up to his madman persona by BRINGING A \*\*\*\*ING SCIMITAR to the ring with him, like he was so much Tiger Jeet Singh! He also takes a bump early on, off a Sabu Asai Moonsault to the floor, and 'Bu is just lucky that he didn't overshoot and land on, you know, a \*\*\*\*ing scimitar. Sadly, this is another one of those matches that only gets a little over 3 minutes, but it's a complete, reckless car crash of high spots for that time, so at least it's fun while it lasts. After 3 minutes of both guys mostly exchanging jumping things off of the top ropes (seriously, it feels like 85% of the match took place with one or both guys on the top turnbuckle), Sabu puts JL away with a Split Legged Moonsault, and Sheik literally puts old school heat on JL by BLOWING A \*\*\*\*ING FIREBALL IN HIS \*\*\*\*ING FACE! It mostly happens off camera of course, because WCW. Note: if memory serves me correctly, this is Sabu's first PPV appearance with the company, and I think his last as well.

  
RESULTS: Sabu def. JL via pinfall

  
MELTZER RATING: \*\*1/2 Probably a fair rating, this could have been an incredible spectacle if they could have gotten even 7 or 8 minutes.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Oh man, I forgot that The Master showed up on this PPV to scream nonsense at the top of his lungs about how they're going to somehow end Hulkamania with a \*\*\*\*ing mummy. And that destruction of Hulkamania is going to cause a WORLDWIDE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN! If you ever wondered why The Master looks like he fell into a vat of flour, I can explain it: he's just coated in cocaine. Sullivan is also in full on ridiculous mode here, putting over how Giant is going to beat Hogan twice: once in the ring, once on the rooftop by being better at monster trucks.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-And here's something that's worth spending money to watch: Mean Gene, Hogan and Jimmy Hart are on hand to present some family with a motorcycle they won in some contest! Woo...hoo? This segments lasts longer than every match we've seen thus far besides the first one, because OF COURSE IT \*\*\*\*ING DOES!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
5: MENG (W/KEVIN SULLIVAN) VS LEX LUGER

  
....Can we go back to the short matches please? The story here is that “LEX LUGER IS IN THE DUNGEON OF DOOM PROBABLY!”, both because WCW Babyfaces (Tony in this case), and because apparently on an episode of Saturday Night, Luger was facing DOD member Shark (FROM TSUNAMI!), and ALSO DOD member Meng came in, kicked Shark in the back of the head, and gave Luger the DQ victory. Anyhow, to give you my reason for not wanting to talk about the actual match, do you remember a few weeks back when Meng fought a knocked out Luger on an episode of Nitro, and it was like 8 minutes of kicking, punching, and restholds? Take that match, give Luger plenty of the same kind of bad offense because he's fresh, and let it go THIRTEEN MINUTES, and then give it a (spoiler) DQ FINISH and yeah, maybe you can see why I give less than zero \*\*\*\*s about this one. Basically take the worst 1995 Raw slow paced, zero urgency kicky punchy chinlocky affair, and throw it right in the middle of a thing we fans were expected to spend money on. To put it another way, it makes PBR's rating of (FART NOISE) sound like Beethoven's Symphony 9 by comparison. The most exciting thing to happen is a guy not cheating, I swear; Luger keeps getting knocked to the floor, Sullivan doesn't try to cheap shot him, and Schiavone thinks this means that LUGER MUST BE IN THE DUNGEON OF DOOM! Actually, scratch that, the legit most exciting thing to happen here is Heenan talking about going out for a business meeting and having sushi, which is pretty meaningless now, but is actually planting the seeds for the awesome common thread that runs through December's Starrcade PPV. Anyhow, the finish, which makes “Roman Reigns earns another title shot by beating Bob Lashley” look like “Daniel Bryan wins the title at Wrestlemania” in terms of strong booking decisions: Luger is in control, so Meng pulls out the Golden Spike, blasts him in the throat with it in plain view of the ref (who of course sees nothing), gets the 2 count, but as the ref is about to count 3, Sullivan runs in and very gently stomps Luger on the shoulder, therefore getting his own man disqualified! Did... Did we \*\*\*\*ing need 13 minutes of the worst wrestling possible to build to that?!?!?! Ah well, this can only mean one thing, sing along if you know the words: LUGER MUST BE IN THE DUNGEON OF DOOM!

  
RESULTS: Luger def. Meng via DQ

  
MELTZER RATING: -\* (Worst Match Of The Night) I'd say that seems kinda generous to me, but I'm pretty sure I missed like 4 hours of this match due to napping, so what do I know?  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Speaking of people who are in the Dungeon of Doom, Mean Gene talks to The Giant! For the record, it's Giant who's in the DOD, I'm not a WCW commentator so I'm not making wild insinuations about Gene... yet... There's something about seeing Giant dressed up like a damn NASCAR driver that makes him seem 100% less intimidating, I swear. Anyhow, at this point in his career, Giant hasn't been known for cutting good promos, so he... actually cuts a pretty damn good promo about how he's going to push Hogan off of the roof of Kobo Hall, and also chokeslam him to win the WCW title? Okay, I wasn't expecting that, so that's a pleasant surprise!

6: ARN ANDERSON AND BRIAN PILLMAN VS STING AND RIC FLAIR

  
OH THANK \*\*\*\*ING GAWD A MATCH THAT SHOULD BE REALLY GOOD! The story here of course, as mentioned at the top of this review, is that Flair was attacked before the show, and the payoff is that... GASP! Sting has to go it alone, 1-on-2! If this happened in 2018, then Sting would probably be allowed to go into the audience and pick a 10 year old boy to be his partner, but I digress. Anyhow, the fun thing here (which Heenan actually brings up) is that this parallels a recent Nitro match, where this very tag match was supposed to happen, only Sting let Flair go it alone to see if he could trust a man who's nickname is the Dirtiest Player In The Game, and who has turned on him multiple times, and STING YOU ARE \*\*\*\*ING STUPID! The in ring storytelling is pretty on point though: Arn is great, Pillman is great, Sting is clearly a level above them on an individual basis, but because it's two on one, he's only able to do so much before the Damned Numbers Game catch up to him. Oh, and also, the audience REALLY wants Flair here, as evidenced by the “We Want Flair” chants, something that WCW probably loved hearing this time around, and not, say, in 1992, when Jim Herd caused Ric to leave the company and fans both revolted and WERE revolted by Herd's “creative”. Anyhow, the Damned Numbers Game. Arn takes over in the funniest way possible: by ramming Sting's head into Pillman's, causing both his partner AND his opponent to be knocked loopy! It sounds stupid, but was actually an old Ole and Gene Anderson spot, to get over the fact that they were tough SOBs where were willing to sacrifice each other's well beings if it meant winning a wrestling match. Not long after, RIC FLAIR SHOWS UP, in regular old street clothes, and with a bandage on his head so you know he's hurt! He tries to get in to make the save, but the ref forces him into his corner and makes this a traditional tag match, where Sting is YOUR face in peril. The heels continue to isolate Sting, and of course take advantage of my favorite traditional tag team trope ever - the “hot tag” partner getting into the ring to help out, but instead just creates a ref distraction - to maintain control, but it falls apart when Arn tosses Pillman with the old Rocket Launcher spot, and he lands belly first on Sting's knees; Double A is able to get into the ring to pull things back together and prevent the tag, however. Finally, Sting fires up, takes both heels down with strikes, makes the hot tag, and leads us to my favorite finish of the night: Flair rebounds off of the ropes, Fargo Struts... and PUNCHES STING RIGHT IN THE \*\*\*\*ING FACE! The ref calls for the DQ because reasons, the Horsemen beat the ever living sh\*t out of Sting in a 3-on-1 flurry of offense, and you now know why I've been making “Sting is stupid” jokes on a nearly weekly basis. What I love about this is that it basically means that the past month or so of WCW storylines has been a complete lie, you have to assume that Ric has been in cahoots with Dabbalay and Pillman for some time, right? And that they were essentially beating the sh\*t out of each other for nothing, all in a long con on the most naive wrestler alive? 

  
RESULTS: No Contest due to Excessive Four Horsemanship

  
MELTZER RATING: \*\*\*3/4 (Match Of The Night) Hmmm, I'm not entirely sure about this. It's definitely in the \*\*\*+ range, but better than the opener? I dunno, if you look at it objectively, this really did feature the same amount of kicky punchy offense and restholds as Luger/Meng, and featured the same “non-finish due to someone turning on their teammate” finish, the main thing to set it apart was that the attacks were done with urgency, it looked like a real fight as opposed to two guys farting around to kill time, and actually told a strong in ring story.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-An outraged Mean Gene gets to talk to the 3/4s of the 4 Horsemen, and the fact that he seems shocked at this turn of events makes him the second dumbest person in the promotion, behind only Sting. Flair screams and rambles a lot, but the gist of the promo (mostly made clear by Arn) is great: we the fans wanted the Horsemen to reunite, well, be careful of what you wish for, because they got it, even if it meant sacrificing the most naive dude in existence!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Backstage, Tenay is on hand to interview Luger about the baffling finish to his terrible match. Luger stumbles through a promo in order to lay out a much more reasonable explanation for why Sullivan turned on Meng than what Tony's been selling: he sees it as Sullivan really wanting Savage vs Luger to take place in hopes that they destroy each other. He managed to get through the whole promo without completely \*\*\*\*ing up words, or complaining about his shirt being too tight, so I call it a huge win.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-After a video recap of the Hogan/Giant feud, including footage from the epic “IT'S NOT HOT” vignette from within the Dungeon's mystical cold water cave, we go to... You know what? I'm going to filibuster this a bit by linking to that video for those who haven't seen it, because it's the worst, but in being so is the LITERAL BEST!  
r/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx8Xb5VJulQ (forgive the Japanese subtitles)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-BAHAHAHA! I still literally LOL for this every damn time! Anyhow, after our recap, we go to... Ah, \*\*\*\* me standing, it's time for the Monster Truck Sumo match. For reasons I couldn't even begin to tell you beyond “he has a boner for Hogan”, Bischoff sits in with Heenan here instead of Schiavone, along with the guy who built Hogan's monster truck, in order to DISCUSS MONSTER TRUCK SPECS! It is just as exciting as it sounds. To give you an idea how of terrible an idea this is, the rules are this: both trucks are attached to each other grill-to-grill, inside of a big circle on top of the roof, whoever uses their truck to push the other truck completely out of the circle wins. There's also RANDOM EXPLOSIVE CHARGES placed on the rooftop, and because the trucks apparently run on alcohol, this is presented as being SUPER LIFE THREATENING! I need to use SO MUCH UPPERCASE TEXT to put over how stupid this is! So yeah, the commentary team puts this over as EPIC and DANGEROUS, but it's just two \*\*\*\*ing trucks doing the tango on a rooftop until - surprise surprise - Hogan pushes Giant's truck outside of the circle. But wait, Giant is a sore loser and goes after Hogan post truck driving! They tussle to the edge of the roof, Giant strangles Hogan, Hogan fights his way out and ACCIDENTALLY KNOCKS THE GIANT OFF OF THE ROOF OF KOBO HALL AND MAKES HIM FALL TO HIS \*\*\*\*ING DEATH!!!!!! I AM NOT MAKING ANY OF THIS SH\*T UP I SWEAR!!!! Bischoff channels his inner Vince McMahon and responds to this tragedy in the same way that Vince did the death of Owen - essentially saying “\*\*\*\* it, the show continues!” - and calls Tony back to resume commentary with a distraught Heenan.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
7: LEX LUGER VS “MACHO MAN” RANDY SAVAGE

  
Hmmm, I wonder how this is going to go? On paper, this would normally play out with a fun “powerhouse who is literally made of muscles and steroids” vs “crafty veteran who is better at wrestling” encounter, but this has an added twist: while both men have wrestled already, Macho only put in a WHOPPING minute and a half of work (as opposed to 13), and had WAY more time to rest up than Luger, because I guess that they felt it was better to give the advantage to the crafty veteran instead of create drama by having the muscular dynamo be the more well rested one? In case you were hoping that this was going to be an under the radar classic, bare three things in mind here: (1) We're asking Luger to wrestle after he's already wrestled for 13 minutes. That'd be like asking Ricochet to try and out-promo Adam Cole. Which, if you watched NXT this week, they already did, and you know how that went; (2) As much as I love Macho Man, and as much as I love a selection of his matches in WCW, by 1995, Savage has very much left the “I'm good at wrestling” part of his career behind, and entered the “look at me, I'm Macho Man, I'm a big name!” portion of it; (3) this is a cooldown match of sorts between a World title match that may not even happen, and a SHOOT MURDER! At BEST, a shoot manslaughter! Luger goes for some Code of Honor stuff, offering a handshake, but Savage used to be a WWF Babyface, so of COURSE he kicks Luger in the gut, WHY WOULDN'T HE? This leads to 5 minutes of the most WWF kicky punchy chinlocky match you could imagine, with LUGER doing the lion's share of the character work here, selling absolute rage on all of his offense, and overselling any blows Savage throws at him. Yes Soupies, while I'm not saying that Luger is a better worker than Savage, I'm saying that tonight, Luger is doing better work than Savage. The best part of the match though is Heenan freaking out about not getting any info on Giant's condition, and it's made all the more enjoyable by the knowledge that Bischoff loved to keep his announcers in the dark about everything that was happening on the show, which means there is at least an 80% chance that Heenan thinks he witnessed a shoot murder and is shoot distraught about it! Anyhow, this match, woof! As mentioned, it's like 5 minutes of bad striking (made enjoyable only by Luger yelling “ARGH!” on everything, whether he's delivering OR taking offense), with the exhausted Luger controlling the fresh as a daisy Savage for like 4m59s of it. Luger goes for the pin with his feet up on the ropes, but the ref doesn't see it because a randomly appearing Jimmy Hart is up on the apron distracting him. Luger then tries to Irish Whip Savage, who reverses it, Luger collides with Hart, and this PUTS LEX INTO A \*\*\*\*ING COMA long enough for Savage to go to the top and hit the only meaningful bit of offense he got all match, the Big Elbow. Do you see what I mean when I say Savage was well past the “good at wrestling” portion of his career at this point? Here he's like a less infuriating Hogan, where he has the ability to instantly win matches, and is only lacking the “no selling your finish” and “having a seizure of strength” parts.

  
RESULTS: Savage def. Luger via pinfall

  
MELTZER RATING: 1/4\* Sounds about fair, I might have gone as low as (DUD) or even -1/2\* if the crowd wasn't into it, booing everything Luger did and popping for Savage's epic one move comeback.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Well, The Giant is dead, either drowned in Lake Michigan, or splattered on the concrete outside of the Kobo Hall (depending on where he fell), but we still have a main event to get to, as Michael Buffer goes to announce Giant's entrance, but instead we get street clothes Hulk Hogan! Remember how over the past couple of weeks, Hogan's been cutting these dark, vaguely Bible misquoting promos about how wearing black gloves and a black doo rag means he's going to SHOOT MURDER Giant? Welp, here he is cutting s “Brothers, I'm sorry I killed a brother, brother!” promo, and assuring us that what happened out there wasn't part of the show. It's the forerunner to the Attitude Era, in that those years were ALL about creating storylines who's entire point was “Everything else on the show is fake but THIS IS REAL!” I'm actually surprised to see it happening here, I had thought that this trend really originated (in WCW at least) with the Pillman “Loose Cannon” stuff in '96. Anyhow, while he's in the midst of recanting his prior threats of murder, with feet that are so cold that “AHHHH, THEY'RE NOT HOT!!!”, THE GIANT makes his way out! A... perfectly intact Giant... Showing no wounds from landing on pavement... no sign of wetness from landing in the lake... so... #LOLOLOLOLOLWHAT?!?!?!?! Welp, I guess we got us a main event after all, and what could be better than lazy ass 1995 Hogan vs a big rookie who's wrestling his first match?  


&amp;#x200B;

  
8: MAIN EVENT - WORLD TITLE MATCH: HULK HOGAN (C) (W/JIMMY HART) VS THE GIANT (W/KEVIN SULLIVAN) 

  
So, remember the last sentence of that last paragraph? Well, you should, as it's just a few lines above. Anyway, reread that sentence before I even start to discuss the match, and ask yourself, GEE, I WONDER HOW GOOD THIS IS GOING TO BE?!?!?! Funny moment right from the start, as Hogan removes his black doo rag to reveal that he has Kevin Sullivan's EVIL FOREHEAD FACE PAINT on his forehead! The reason I say this is hilarious is because he FACES AWAY FROM THE HARD CAM, so we at home miss the big reveal!!!! Maybe WCW needed its own NXT and Performance Center to prevent stupid gaffe's like this? Or maybe he just wanted to prevent Schiavone from saying “This can only mean one thing... HULK HOGAN IS WITH THE DUNGEON OF DOOM!”, I dunno. Anyhow, the match. Picture Hogan/Andre at WM 3, only with none of the awesome build up or in ring storytelling that made that memorable, if Andre were SUPER green, and if Hogan were the decrepit one. Yeah. Just yeah. Lots of Giant no selling, lots of bad looking strikes, and I think the most athletic thing we see through most of it is Hogan being unable to bodyslam Giant. I'm also starting to think that crowd noise was being piped in, because you hear loud HOGAN chants, but everyone in the audience who's on hard cam are pretty much just sitting on their hands saying nothing. But hey, if there's a plus side to this, it's that Hogan must be feeling altruistic tonight; instead of taking Giant's finish and going into his bullsh\*t no selling seizure of invulnerability, here he dodges an attempted “leg drop” (I put it in quotes because it looked more like a bad Senton) and then goes into his bullsh\*t no selling seizure of invulnerability! You know how it goes from here: bad 80's WWF punches and offense that looks like it wouldn't hurt former WWE tag team champion Nicholas but is KILLING this massive rookie, and the most devastating move in Hogan's repertoire: the BACK RAKE OF DOOM! Seriously, this is a thing that Hogan tried to get over for YEARS during the nWo, but at least there, he had gloves with the fingertips cut out. Here, it's just plain old black gloves, but he's able to REND AND TEAR THE GIANT'S BACK MUSCLES THROUGH SHEER FINGER STRENGTH PROBABLY! Giant goes for a chokeslam, but Uber Babyface Hulk Hogan RAKES THE EYES, because Hogan has ALWAYS been an evil dude, brother! And if all of this doesn't sound exciting enough, once Giant gets back in control, we get TWO LENGTHY BEAR HUG SPOTS! Your butts must be sore from how much you're sitting on the edge of your seats right now! Finally, Giant hits the big Chokeslam, covers, one, two, Hogan kicks out and goes into his no selling seizure of invulnerability... ARE YOU \*\*\*\*ING SH\*TTING ME?!?!?!?!?!?! If there's anyone on here who still defends Hogan for reasons beyond his importance to the business... WHY?!?!?!?! The brother has done more to harm pro wrestling and make it look like a phony thing for idiots than Vince \*\*\*\*ing Russo for \*\*\*\*s sake! Anyhow, \*\*\*\* this piece of sh\*t, \*\*\*\* this match, it's almost over anyway so let's just skip to the finish, which is both spectacularly overbooked, AND sets off a baffling chain of events that include multiple betrayals and alignment changes, and the (up until this point) dumbest moment in WCW's history. Hogan hits the Big Boot, when it doesn't score a knockdown, he bodyslams Giant, hits the Leg Drop, covers, but Jimmy Hart has knocked the referee out with the World title! Mind you, you wouldn't notice it if you're watching at home (like I am!), because Craig Leathers is a worse producer than Kevin Dunn and misses the shot. Hart feigns innocence and helps Hogan help the ref up, but then OOPS! He runs off, grabs the belt, and HITS HOGAN WITH IT! GAAAAAASP! Hogan of course no sells it half a second later, but I'm okay with it this time. Hart weighs, what, maybe twice as much as that belt at best? Even the ref should have been able to shrug that off. Giant instigates our THIRD lengthy bearhug spot of the match, which brings in Sullivan to throw some sh\*tty punches. THAT brings in both Luger and Savage to make the save, but Savage is subdued by Hart and the World title that Hogan JUST NO SOLD (not an intentional booking decision, honest, ahem...), and LUGER starts attacking SAVAGE! CLEARLY THIS MEANS THAT LUGER HAS JOINED THE DUNGEON OF DOOM! And not that, you know, those two had a match earlier, and that Luger and Savage still hate each other. THIS brings out the YET-TAY, and in the one moment of this whole match that prevents this sh\*tpile from becoming negative stars (for making me laugh so much), he gently wraps his arms around Hogan's neck, from behind, and STARTS DRY HUMP ANAL RAPING HULK HOGAN!!!!!!!! I AM NOT MAKING ANY OF THIS UP, he just kinda barely crossfaces him and starts wiggling his hips, kinda rubbing his crotch against Hogan's ass, and IT KILLS HULK HOGAN SUPER DEAD!!!!! This is one of those moments that's going to require proof, isn't it? Well, I came prepared!

  
r/https://youtu.be/ELl3TTeGwek?t=150   


  
Or as I like to call it, Hulk Hogan's FIRST Sex Tape! Anyhow, after this, Luger proves all of Schiavone's wild claims to be correct by putting Hogan in the Torture Rack, and then they move onto Savage, giving him a brief Giant/Yeti DP session and a Luger Rack for their troubles. And this is the note we end on. Giant wins by DQ, he's not the champion, but he leaves with the belt anyway. But don't worry, THIS GETS EVEN MORE CONVOLUTED OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS!

  
RESULTS: Giant def. Hogan via DQ

  
MELTZER RATING: \*\* HOW! HOW THE \*\*\*\* DID THIS EVEN GET MORE THAN \*?!?!?!?! I'm usually Mr “Match Ratings Are Subjective And Not Scientific” but NO! This was a terrible pile of sh\*t that would have been a -\* anti-classic if the ending wasn't so laugh out loud worthy!  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
PPV BUYS: 0.60 Well, this did better numbers than the last PPV, and holy sh\*t, did those fans get the opposite of their money's worth! This is honestly a really fun show to go back and watch on, like, Dailymotion, or even on the WWE Network (ONLY $9.99 MAGGLE!) like I did, but could you imagine spending PPV money on this sh\*tpile? I didn't even watch the event when it happened and I want my 1995 money back!

  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion, but as much as I loved the Sting vs Two Of The Horsemen While Partnering With The Third Horseman Because He Is An Idiot Match, I still think the opener between Badd and Page was actually the superior match. It told just as strong of an in ring story, while also featuring more action, better spots, less restholds, and didn't have a \*\*\*\* finish. This match is even MORE superior if you grade on a curve, and consider the talent involved in it vs the much higher talent quotient involved in the tag match. But you can't go wrong with making either match your pick, honestly.

  
LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: As much as I want to give it to green ass Giant and infuriating ass Hogan, at least that had enough campy LOL worthy material to make it memorable. Watching 13 minutes of Luger d\*cking around the ring with Meng was about as bad as Hogan/Giant, but is also entirely forgettable. I think that's mostly because it was so bad, your brain just kills all brain cells that would normally remember that the match was even a thing, as a defense mechanism.   


  
NEXT WEEK: The fallout from Halloween Havoc! How will Hulkamania react to getting destroyed by multiple betrayals and ancient Egyptian sodomy? How will this storyline, and the status of the World title, become even more convoluted? Be sure to check it out! Over on Raw, meanwhile, nothing but punches and chinlocks probably! And also, Razor defends his IC title against Owen Hart, insuring that we get at least ONE good match on the card!

&amp;#x200B;

PART 1 - WCW MONDAY NITRO 10/30/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Fun fact: During the commentary team's opening pow-wow, Bischoff proclaims that tonight, we will see footage of last night's literal (anal) raping of Hulkamania, except that they have to wait for WCW to give them the tape. So... WCW... has to wait to get the tape from... WCW? I HAVE NO IDEA BUT IT'S OKAY, WE”RE GOING TO SEE SOME GREAT ACTION TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HULK HOGAN! Nailed it!  


  
1: SGT. CRAIG PITTMAN VS EDDIE GUERRERO

  
We also learn that it was originally supposed to be Savage facing Pittman tonight, but he is too injured after being butt\*\*\*\*ed by a mummy and Torture Racked by Luger, so instead Eddie is working as a fill in. Two notes on this: (1) I absolutely LOVE the idea of having a standby to take the place of a wrestler who can't make it, because it really helps the illusion that this is a sporting event where the cards are crafted in advance, and not just generated by a GM hearing people arguing in the ring and saying “YOU'VE GOT A MATCH NOW!” (2) Given how lazy of a worker 1995 Savage has proven to be, getting Eddie feels like the biggest \*\*\*\*ing upgrade possible! And luckily for us this match continues the trend of occasional Pittman matches we see that make me sit back and go “Wait... was Craig Pittman actually a low key awesome wrestler?” Granted, it's not hard to have a good match when your opponent is Eddie \*\*\*\*ing Guerrero, but Pittman himself is all kinds of awesome here, going for huge Greco Roman suplexes, Gutwrench Suplexes, and just overall looking like a complete beast who I could see doing well in this era of AJPW if he only learned how to drop opponent's on their heads while doing so. Eddie, for his part, opts to play Pittman's game, getting some nice amateur wrestling throws of his own in there, and Pittman is having none of that, dropping the catch as catch can sh\*t for pure brawling followed by grinding the arm down the moment he feels threatened. Again though, Eddie is not a man to be trifled with, he starts firing back with shots of his own, and this turns into a really fun battle of “You want to hit me with that? I CAN DO THAT TOO!” Eddie's not lying or cheating, but he's stealing Pittman's gameplan, and now I feel like a complete idiot for not being that high on him during his babyface run, because sh\*t, as white bread as he was, dude was very clearly better than almost everyone else in the company at this point. And pretty much every other point. Pittman takes control of the match once more, pretty much holding it until the finish, which plays on another important pair of traits that make Eddie the superior wrestler here: his heart, and his experience. Pittman hits a couple of big belly to bellies off of Irish Whips. Perhaps getting overconfident, he goes to the well a third time, but this time, Eddie sees it coming, hooks Pittman's arm, jumps and twists himself backwards in midair, and catches him with a flash roll up for the win. Holy sh\*t, if you want to witness a low key classic that doesn't exactly reinvent wrestling as an artform or anything, but still manages to blend great in ring work and in ring storytelling, do yourself a favor and hunt this one down.

  
RESULTS: Guerrero def. Pittman via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: THE SHARK (FROM TSUNAMI!!!!!!) VS SCOTT NORTON

  
And now, the polar opposite of Pittman/Guerrero! As a reminder, these two are basically at odds because Shark's fatness cost Norton a match. More specifically, Shark got knocked onto Norton's legs, preventing him from being able to evade or kick out from a Macho Man Big Elbow. I'm 90% sure that it took longer for me to type that quick summary than it did for this match to unfold. It's sad too, because on paper this could have been kinda fun. Shark is a big bruiser who, despite having that former sumo wrestler body, was surprisingly agile when he wanted to be. Norton is kind of like a Caucasian Big E, just a big ole powerlifter who looks like he could Gorilla Press a Sherman Tank. On paper, this should be a good old fashioned hoss fight. Just two big, powerful men throwing bombs at each other, throwing each other around, and only occasionally selling for each other. In practice, it's a two minute teaser of this premise, until they both go to the floor, and just opt to brawl and take the double count out instead of wrestling a full wrestling match. WOMP WOMP! It's a shame too, because those two minutes of hosstastic action were really fun. Also, remember last week when I mentioned that Heenan's talk of “sushi with a business associate” was teasing a really fun hook for Starrcade? That storyline continues here, as we cut away from the match to see Heenan (who had left commentary between the first two matches) is dining with former Martial Arts Match referee/future Guy Who Manages Japanese Wrestlers So You Know That They're Evil, Sonny Ono. The slow burn build to a cool premise continues!

  
RESULTS: No contest due to double count out  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Schiavone hits the ring, microphone in hand, to discuss the Greatest Something In The History Of Our Sport! Or rather, to show photographs of the ongoing saga of “STING, YOU ARE STUPID FOR TRUSTING THE LEADER OF THE 3/4 HORSEMEN!” Speaking of the incomplete Horsemen, Tony brings them out for an interview, and possibly to put some butts in the seats. The funny part about this interview is that Arn is clearly the only one here trying to not throw Sting under the bus and look like an idiot. Pillman is pretty much just going “HAHAHAHA! IT WAS FUNNY WHEN STING TAGGED FLAIR IN, AND RIC TURNED ON HIM, STING IS AN IDIOT, HAHAHAHA!” Flair just screams and barely sounds like he's saying words, I think he's putting over the fact that the Horsemen are being reformed, and literally compares Sting to the women that the Horsemen lie to in order to \*\*\*\* them and ditch them. Meanwhile, stalwart professional Dabbalay is left to go “Sting, I commend you for hanging with the Horsemen”, and absolutely put him over as an in ring competitor, as well as put him over for being honorable, and NOT a naive, brain damaged yokel. More importantly, the tease is made, soon there will be a 4th Horseman once more, and I assure you all, it's definitely NOT a shoot murderer! Nope! Ahem...  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: SABU VS DISCO INFERNO

  
If memory serves me correctly, I think that this is Sabu's last match with the company, though he was never officially, formally fired. According to the man himself, Sabu just stopped getting bookings, and didn't even realize he was fired until someone told him to call the WCCW Hotline, and THAT'S how he learned that he was let go. \*\*\*\*ing OUCH! Like all Sabu matches, it's a beautiful whirlwind of sloppiness and high spots, and the crowd LOVES it! Props to Disco here as well, for bumping like a Memphis heel while on defense, and going full on hoss mode when on offense, tossing 'Bu around like a rag doll, and planting him to the mat with a stiff as \*\*\*\* lariat. Disco Inferno continues that same trend as Craig Pittman, where I have to keep looking back and going “Wait... Was DI secretly a super dope worker?” And then out of nowhere, Sabu knocks DI to the ground, hits a Springboard Somersault Leg Drop from the apron to the ring, and gets the win. Of course, we all know how Sabu operates, and he's not done YET! This time, he takes Disco to the floor post-match, and hits him with a Diving... I don't even know what it was supposed to be, it looks like he was maybe going for a rana, but he just kinda hits DI in the face with his taint, falls backwards, and lands on his own head. Then he THROWS A \*\*\*\*ING TABLE at Disco, sets it up, puts DI on the table, and does a Somersault Senton... which whiffs, because DI moved... and it's one of those Japanese style tables, the ones that refuse to break... And OUCH!!!!! Sabu, of course, no sells it, because why WOULD he register pain, and takes his frustration out on the table, throwing it and later the ring steps to the floor violently while DI escapes. And that's the way Sabu's WCW career ended: not with a bang, but a lot of furniture getting chucked.

  
RESULTS: Sabu def. Disco via pinfall

4: LEX LUGER AND MEN (W/JIMMY HART AND KEVIN SULLIVAN) VS AMERICAN MALES

  
So there we go, if you needed further proof that Schiavone was right, and Luger is with the Dungeon of Doom, this feels like as good as any. Man, the production of this one feels like a modern episode of Smackdown to be honest. We start with Meng in control of the match, go to commercial break a minute in, and when we return, LUGER is getting dominated by BAGWELL! Gee... I think we MIGHT have missed a key moment here... It also seems funny to me that the Dungeon Of Doom get an actual main event level wrestler in their stable, and instead of this match being a showcase of how powerful they are now that Luger's on board, it's “NOPE! This new guy is getting his sh\*t kicked in by Wrestling Chippendales!” It's also... I'm not going to say terrible, because it's well worked, but this is basically a 1995 Raw match on Nitro. So much slow ass kicky punchy chinlocky offense, which is only made better than a Raw match by Luger's dramatic screams of “ARGH!” every time he either takes or gives offense. Some double teaming does allow both DOD members to control Riggs, but the hot tag to a fired up Bagwell fixes that situation, and it takes a SUPER STUPID FINISH to give the “hey, they should be overpowered and in control the whole time” heels the victory. Observe: after getting taken to the proverbial woodshed, Luger catches a Bagwell crossbody, but Riggs comes in, dropkicks his OWN PARTNER in the back in order to topple Luger over, and the future Buff gets the pinfall... but it's only a VISUAL pin, because Jimmy Hart is hopping up and down on the apron, which of COURSE means the ref has to stop paying attention to the match and pay attention to the scrawny hyper guy. I should note that Bagwell gets like a visual 6 or 7 count here, because apparently Luger is easily knocked unconscious by holding a guy who's getting kicked in the spine. See also: him losing to Savage due to running into Jimmy Hart at the PPV. Meng comes in, both Males get Mafia Kicks for their troubles, and Luger picks up the win with a Torture Rack on an unconscious male stripper. THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE YOUR NEW TOP LEVEL HEEL LOOK DANGEROUS!

  
RESULTS: Luger and Meng def. American Males (Luger submitted Bagwell)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-MAIN EVENT TALKING: Finally, WCW was able to get that PPV footage from WCW, so we get to re-witness  the series of ass rapings and alignment shifts that was Halloween Havoc's main event. The video actually cuts off before we see Savage get sodomized and racked, because he's clearly not as important as Hogan, and I am 100% sure that this is the most intentional decision possible. When we return to ringside, Schiavone is on hand with Giant (still sporting the WCW World title), Luger, Hart and Sullivan, and Hart's explanation of why he turned on Hogan is baffling and hilarious: “I'm not going to tell you now, maybe I'll tell you next week!” OKAY THEN, GLAD WE TALKED TO YOU! Luger doesn't have much to add, but what he says actually makes a lot of sense: this is what Hogan gets for calling him a little dog and basically being a piece of human feces. I have to side with Lex on this one. Plus Sullivan responding to Luger putting over the carnage by FLOPPING TO THE MAT LIKE A FISH, doing his best “I'm Hogan convulsing in pain” impression was \*\*\*\*ing CHOICE! Also, the group insists that despite not winning the World title, the Giant is actually legally the World champion (???), and issues a John Cena style Open Challenge for his title next week. So yeah, that's how we opt to close the show, a long series of promos basically saying “Sorry, we haven't written the next part of the storyline, but we'll have it figured out next week, so tune in then please?”

PART 2 - WWF MONDAY NIGHT RAW 10/30/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Oh dear Gawd no... Just in case you thought that “the WWE does stupid holiday themed wrestling shows with stupid sh\*t on it” was a modern trope, feast your eyes and ears on the terrible splendor that is Todd Penttengil doing a TERRIBLE DRACULA VOICE as he narrates Halloween themed things with a big Raw pumpkin graphic on screen, and recaps last week's IC #1 contender battle royal while SCREAMS randomly sound off! THIS IS HOW YOU BEAT NITRO IN THE RATINGS DAMNIT! However, it's all worth it just to see our commentary team ALSO celebrating, by DRESSING UP IN HALLOWEEN COSTUMES, which is something the current team absolutely should do every year. Lawler dressing up as a doctor is funny enough, both because there's probably a million terrible “I'm a pediatric gynecologist, McMahon, HEEHEE!” jokes I could be making, AND because the dude doesn't even NEED a costume. He dresses like a \*\*\*\*ing king on a daily basis, every day IS basically Halloween for him! Topping that is Vince dressing like a jailbird. Like one year after he went to trial for the whole steroid scandal, and stood the chance of BECOMING a shoot jailbird. That sh\*t has to be the most intentional “WINK WINK NOD NOD DO YOU GET IT?” ever, right?!?!?! Well, considering Lawler says “I heard you got that outfit a year ago but didn't get to wear it”, and Vince shoots him the DIRTIEST LOOK POSSIBLE? Oh yeah, that was \*\*\*\*ing intentional and I love it!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: SAVIO VEGA VS GOLDUST

  
Oh damn, as Vega makes his entrance, we discover that the Spanish announce team is ALSO dressed up Halloween costumes! Specifically, Dracula and Stephanie McMahon. Wait, sorry, that's Satan, they both look so much alike that it's hard to tell. Ahem. Anyhow, this is Goldust's free tv debut match, will he do just as well here as he did during his PPV debut against Marty “How Long Before My Substance Problems Gets Me Fired Again?” Jannetty? Yeah, yes he probably will. It's still a very 1995 Raw match, but I do have to applaud Goldust for firing off with great intensity at the top of the match, if I have to sit through bad 1995 Raw punchy kicky chinlocky offense, a little violent aggression helps make it more palatable. Sadly the pace he cuts to start doesn't last long, and what would later become termed Ruthless Aggression melts away into Passive Aggression. I can't remember if I've made this joke, but \*\*\*\* the tagline “The New Generation”, I'm calling this era “The Passive Aggression era” due to this horribly lackluster in ring style. The highlight of the match is Lawler finally clarifying that he is dressed as a proctologist, and Vince deadpanning the amazing response of “Started at the bottom and stayed there, huh?” Say what you will about Vince's ability to call wrestling matches or make noises that sound like words when he's screaming at the top of his lungs, but he and Lawler have really fun chemistry when they're taking jabs at each other. Anyhow, let's get right to the finish, which is the most unexciting thing possible (like the match as a whole!), yet also very soundly logical and cool from a psychology standpoint. So like 6 hours of this 5 hour match (don't ask how it worked out like this, shut up, it just did) involved Goldust working Vega's arm until it was time for the fired up slow offense comeback. The kicker comes when Vega tries for his biggest move - the Spinning Wheel Kick, because Tyler Breeze wasn't the FIRST guy to win matches with a transitional high spot - but OOPS! Dust is too clever! He evades, blasts Savio with a Big Boot RIGHT to the injured arm, puts him in a hammerlock, and turns that into a Cradle for the flash pin. Like I said, not exciting at all, but it's a nice little touch that makes it look like a wrestling match can be won in many different ways, and not just because someone hit their move that always wins matches.

  
RESULTS: Goldust def. Vega via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Oh hey, a Slam Jam report that's worth discussing for actual important reasons, and not just me making fun of Dok “P.S.” Hendrix! Here we learn that the upcoming World tile match between Bret Hart and Diesel will be no DQ, no count outs, and no time limit. The last one seems suspect to me, because I don't even recall the WWF DOING time limits in this era.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-OH MY GAWD YES, YES, SO MUCH RIDICULOUS YES!!!!!!! Okay guys, so Survivor Series is being sponsored by Milton Bradley's Karate Fighters game. Picture Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, but with karate guys limply “kicking” each other when you mash the button. This sponsorship is VERY IMPORTANT to mention, because it plays into a toy commercial storyline: WWF Best Friends Of Different Cultures, Jewish American Barry Horrowitz and Japanese Hakushi, have come to a major disagreement over which country has the best food and baseball players. It's a disagreement so severe that it can only be settled by determining WHO IS BETTER AT TOYS! They mash the attack button while a WWF REFEREE LOOKS ON, and finally, Horowitz is able to prove the supremacy of cheeseburgers vs sushi by being better at toys than Hakushi. I'm not going to front, the WWF's Karate Fighters stuff is a HUGE guilty pleasure of mine, and I cannot WAIT until the Karate Fighters Tournament becomes a weekly feature over the course of a month or so. I THINK they do it in '96 and '97, but I'm secretly hoping that I'm mistaken and it takes place in '95 and '96. Note: the finals of the second Karate Fighters tournament is so important, that it actually helped kickstart Goldust's career as a “yes, he's hetero, we swear” babyface AND allowed pro wrestling Archie Bunker in a King's crown get the word “queer” onto WWF tv, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: MARTY JANNETTY VS SOME JOBBER

  
Is it sad that a 3 or 4 minute long jobber squash was WAY more entertaining than our opener? There's not much to say about it, as I don't even think the jobber got in any significant offense, but we got to see Marty land actual dynamic, athletic offense throughout, so there's that. Granted, nothing we saw here could hold a candle to what's going on in the CW scene in WCW (WCWCW scene?), but it's basically \*\*\*\*ing 205 Live compared to the usual punchy kicky chinklocky nonsense. Jannetty picks up the win with a Diving Fistdrop from the top, clearing half of the ring to do so, and I remain sad that Marty's personal demons always served to keep him from becoming as big a deal in the business as he could and should have been.

  
RESULTS: Jannetty def. Jobber via pinfall.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Jailbird Vince enters the ring now, to conduct an interview with the British Bulldog and Jim Cornette. Corney has an interesting point in his angry rambling here: before our last IYH show, Gorilla Monsoon stated that whomever won the World title match would go on to face Bret Hart at Survivor Series. Bulldog won by DQ (thanks to Hart), but Monsoon changed his mind and said “Nope, Diesel is the champion so HE goes on to face Bret now!” It's great heel twisted logic, made all the more sweet by Corney bringing back his personal lawyer Clarence Mason to help get justice for Davey Boy! Mason is another guilty pleasure of mine, the man just nailed his role so expertly, he was amusing to me in 1995, and is still amusing to me now. He reiterates what Cornette was talking about, and lays out two demands: (1) Monsoon needs to give Bulldog a match against Hart, in order to get revenge for Bret costing the title through interfering; (2) Bulldog needs to be removed from the Wildcard match at Survivor Series, because it's not fair that he should be forced to partner with guys who hate him like HBK. Bulldog then cuts a promo on Jannetty, his opponent for next week, and holy sh\*t, between Vince calling him “Motty”, and Bulldog calling him “Matty”, there's a lot of people in this ring that can't \*\*\*\*ing pronounce “Marty Jannetty”! Anyhow, because Marty is a WWF Babyface, he takes umbrage at getting promo'd, runs out, sneaks up behind Bulldog, and dropkicks him in the back like a coward... er, I mean, like a ROLE MODEL! YEAH! Corney gets assaulted as well, but Marty stops short of beating up a lawyer, so I guess he has SOME sense of... I was going to say decency, but I guess it's more like “not wanting to get sued.”  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: THE SMOKING GUNNS VS SOME JOBBERS

  
So remember how I described that last squash as essentially being short but kinda dynamic and exciting? Here's the exact opposite of that! I legit think that this match would have been 10 times better if it were both teams sitting down to play toys instead. The most exciting thing to happen is a picture in picture promo from a VERY out of it 1-2-3 Kid, who is looking to “apologize” to “Billy Bart Smoking Gunns” (his words, not mine) and instead just challenges them to a rematch, or ELSE. Or else what is never made known, sadly, but knowing Waltman? It'll probably involve him sh\*tting in their food. The finish is the second most exciting thing to happen, which is less for the finish itself and more for the retroactive “Wait... what?!?!?!” moment, as the Gunns put away jobber Scott D'Amore with the Sidewinder, and yes, IT IS ABSOLUTELY THAT Scott D'Amore, the one who is currently running Impact with Don Callis. I love it when you get a jobber squash where the guy getting squashed actually goes on to do something in the business, it's fun AND wrestling history!

  
RESULTS: Gunns def. Jobbers (Billy pinned The Guy Who's Helped Make Impact Really \*\*\*\*ing Good)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Bret Hart cuts a pre-recorded promo on Diesel, and it's pretty standard fare white meat babyface “You're good and you're my friend but I am going to beat you anyway” stuff here, capped off with the WORST ATTEMPT AT SOUNDING LIKE A TOUGH GUY EVER: “Big Guy, meet the Truck Stop!” Um... ... ... #LOLWhat?!?!?!?!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Somehow making way more sense than that Truck Stop line, we get another pre-recorded promo, where an extremely apoplectic Paul Bearer screams and screams about how despite being a mangled mess, The Undertaker WILL return. Honestly, did anyone even doubt that? I mean, we saw him come back from LITERAL DEATH at the hands of Yokozuna (and like 300 heels) after that terrible Royal Rumble casket match, I'm pretty sure recovering from a broken face is pretty rote for him.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: MAIN EVENT - IC TITLE MATCH: OWEN HART (W/JIM CORNETTE) VS RAZOR RAMON

  
Remember my theory (you should, as I bring it up all of the \*\*\*\*ing time) about how the only people allowed to consistently have good matches on Raw are members of the Kliq and the Hart family/ Well, tonight we have BOTH of those factors meeting head on in one-on-one action, which means we're either getting a masterclass of free tv wrestling, or both of their awesomeness negates each other. Which will it be? Actually, it largely plays out somewhere between both predicted extremes, with Owen wrestling a very fun, dynamic style, and Razor working a more traditionally WWF kicky punchy chinlocky deal. Despite the fact that, you know, Owen's a heel, Razor's a face, and their roles should PROBABLY reversed. Because the WWF has always enjoyed the potential for overbooked nonsense even prior to Russo becoming a writer, Yokozuna and Mr Fuji make their way to ringside to watch on, and GEE, I wonder if he's going to factor into this at all?!?!?! Things do pick up for the last couple of minutes, with both Owen and Razor working it like the safe version of an AJPW finishing sprint, and then gets the absolute lamest finish possible for the match: Razor gets Owen up for the Razor's Edge, Yokozuna runs in to pull Owen out of it, and that's enough for the ref to call for the DQ/ OKAY THEN! Post-match, Yoko starts beating the booze and pills out of Razor but 1-2-3 Kid makes the save! This is an ill advised move, as Yoko just says “LOL Nope”, puts Kid down with a headbutt, and squashes Kid with a BIG Legdrop. THIS brings out Ahmed Johnson, who thankfully is asked only to slam Yokozuna, and not talk, but sadly doesn't get his own version of the Lex Express for doing so. And that's how we end the show: a fat Samoan pretending to be Japanese getting body slammed by a living pile of grease pretending to be a human being.  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
TV RATINGS: Nitro def. Raw 2.3 to 2.1. Wow, both shows were down overall here, with Nitro winning but still dropping a whole 0.3 points in the process. Still, it's hard for me to argue with this. While Raw didn't have anything that was actively terrible, neither did Nitro really, plus WCW ALSO had better high points. Still, another pretty good week of pro wrestling all around.  


  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: How weird is it to see Craig Pittman getting “Highlight of the Night” kudos, right?!?!?! I was secretly expecting Owen/Razor to take the nod here to be honest, because Owen is one of my all time favorites, and Hall is incredible when he's not in “personal demons” mode, but something about their match didn't click like I had hoped; it was good, but I was expecting great, you know? But yeah, Eddie/Pittman was \*\*\*\*ing dope as hell, and I hope that all y'all checked it out like I recommended.  


  
LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: Nothing was outrageously bad or anything this week, but as much as I want to give it to the tag team jobber squash on Raw, for making me sit through another \*\*\*\*ing Smoking Gunns match, I have to give it to the Luger/Meng vs American Males snore and borefest on Nitro. It honestly felt more like watching a '95 Raw match than any of tonight's Raw matches, and was such a horrible mismatch of bad WWF '95 tropes: stupid occupational gimmicks (oh hi American Male Strippers) + boring wrestling + stupid, convoluted, overbooked finish = definite lowlight of the night.  


  
NEXT WEEK: On Nitro, it's Taboo Tuesday, but only on a Monday, and a completely different promotion! Fans get to call in to vote on which babyface they want to see face which heel, so if anyone in 1995 was clamoring to pit Evad Sullivan and Kamala in a match, this was THEIR TIME! Meanwhile, over on Raw, #1 contender to the World title Bret Hart teams up with former rival/current loser at toys Hakushi in order to further his ongoing feud with Wrestling Dentist and Wrestling Pedophile...er... King! With a stellar title program like this, it's hard to believe that Bret even stayed with the company long enough to get screwed in '97!

PART 1 - WCW MONDAY NITRO 11/06/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-As alluded to in my “NEXT WEEK” section of last week's review, tonight's main event is going to be a Taboo Tuesday style deal, where fans get to phone in and pay 0.99/minute to vote on which two wrestlers square off! To show how completely on the up and up (ahem) all of this is, we even get flashes of who's in each of the locker rooms (babyface and heel, respectively) and is eligible for voting, and holy sh\*t... This thing is SO \*\*\*\*ING RIGGED! Okay, so you know how whenever the WWE does a “YOU get to choose!” kind of deal, they rig the voting in one of two ways to get to the desired outcome? If this is a thing you had never considered before, look at the two ways in which these are usually presented: (1) All options are basically the same. Example: “What kind of match should AJ Styles and Samoa Joe have? A) A Street Fight; B) A No Holds Barred Match; C) A No DQ Match”; (2) They give you one option you'd actually vote for, and the rest of the choices are ones that no one with an IQ of over 5 would actually make. Example: “Who do you want to see Daniel Bryan wrestle tonight? A) The Miz, whom he's feuding with; B) Former WCW champion David Arquette; C) The Great Khali” Obviously I exaggerate for comedic purposes, but this is basically how they rig their votes. WCW opts for #2, and do so by presenting the most obvious locker room choices possible: the babyface locker rooms has STING, and a bunch of schlubs that no one gave a sh\*t about then, and the heel locker room consists of RIC FLAIR (whom Sting is feuding with) and a bunch of schlubs that no one gave a sh\*t about. And also, Bischoff basically tells us to vote for the two names in uppercase by reminding us of their bad blood stemming from Halloween Havoc. GEE, I WONDER WHAT OUR MAIN EVENT IS GOING TO BE?!?!?! Stay tuned for that Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs Shark barnburner that everyone in 1995 was chomping at the bits for!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: COBRA VS THE GIANT (W/ JIMMY HART)

  
Holy sh\*t, speaking of schlubs that no one gave a sh\*t about... By which I mean Cobra, Giant may have been super green but people still gave a sh\*t about him. So we haven't seen Cobra since Fall Brawl, where he had an incredibly short match against Sgt. Pittman that saw him get murked in like 2 minutes. Apparently Cobra wrestled exclusively in short matches that saw him taking the L, because this one makes Pittman/Cobra look like the Hart/HBK Iron Man Match in terms of match length. The match was literally just Cobra running at Giant, getting Chokeslammed, and pinned. WOMP WOMP! Note: This is basically the best possible Cobra match. Or 1995 Giant match if I'm being honest.

  
RESULTS: Giant def. Cobra via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-......This is another one of those vignettes where I'm going to have to hit you with a YouTube link because I don't have the words to describe it, or prove that I'm not lying..... So apparently, Macho Man has joined Hulk Hogan on the Darkside brother, and they opt to prove how evil they are now by hanging out with homeless people on Venice Beach and discussing WCW storylines, all while music is being played in the background by street musician Harry Perry, better known by his “stage” name of the KAMA KOSMIC KRUSADER! Yes, it IS retroactively hilarious that someone with the initials of KKK is present during a Hogan segment, ahem. But yeah, the main gist of it (outside of the coke fueled ramblings) is that Savage has a master plan: he's going to PRETEND he's a good guy, but secretly be a SPY for Hogan and is going to find out who's on his side! Three things here: (1) I don't know how being insane and high on coke works, but is it REALLY such a good idea to discuss your plans for clandestine infiltration and espionage on national television? (2) This REALLY makes Hogan feel like the shy nerdy kid who wants to ask the hot chick out, but is too afraid to do it so he gets his friend to do it for him. And then she uses that friend as a messenger to break his young adolescent heart, and WHY DID YOU HURT ME LIKE THAT?!?!?! I ONLY WANTED TO LOVE YOU DAMNIT!!!! Er... I mean... Yeah! (3) #LOLWHAT THE \*\*\*\*?!?!?!?!?! Fortunately, this is clearly rock bottom for Hulk, and nothing he can do will be more ludicrous than this. Note: that's a bold face lie, he absolutely tops this next week. And lest you think I'm ribbing you all...

  
r/https://youtu.be/lej2oPVuRTc?t=45  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: KEVIN SULLIVAN VS THE RENEGADE

  
....Can we go back to Hogan and Savage discussing WCW storylines with the homeless instead? All kidding aside, this one actually winds up being far more entertaining than it had any rights to be for two reasons: (1) Although the action is like 99% brawling, it winds up being very stiff, believable striking, so at least it looks like a fight; (2) The entire purpose of this segment is BASICALLY the emasculation of Renegade, which honestly cracks my cynical ass up something fierce. All through the match, Hart keeps yelling sh\*t to Renegade on his megaphone, basically saying that if he would have stuck with Hart (and presumably join the Dungeon of Doom I guess?), he could have been a huge deal, maybe even the next Hogan, but now he's made a huge mistake and is going to be a big pile of nothing. Renegade gets in a bit of offense early on, and on the fired up comeback, but yeah, this is mostly just Sullivan figuratively (and possibly literally) beating the sh\*t out of him until finally putting him away with the Double Stomp. (Picture Finn Balor's Coup De Gras, only with almost zero vertical air, dude's basically jumping down instead of up and forwards). The emasculation continues post-match, when Hart grabs a rag, pulls a Randy Orton 23 years before Orton wiped off Jeff Hardy's facepaint, and says “Look at this, you're a nobody, you're just plain old Rick now!” I'd probably find this even more hilarious if Plain Old Rick's life didn't end with... you know, Von Erich style shotgun suicide, so I'll just shut up now before I make this sentence even darker somehow.

  
RESULTS: Sullivan def Plain Old Rick via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: CHRIS BENOIT VS EDDIE GUERRERO

  
Chris Benoit vs Eddie Guerrero is basically my favorite sentence in the English language! If you saw their prior Nitro match against each other, and enjoyed it, be sure to check out this one as it is very much more of the same. IE: some of the best, most physical and realistic looking pro wrestling in history. Good gawd, I don't think I've seen a wrestler work with as much intensity as Benoit here, not before this era, not during it, not ever it. Eddie almost manages to match it, plus sells his ass off (which may be less selling, and more “OH GAWD THIS REALLY \*\*\*\*ING HURTS!”), and it all adds up to something magical. Of course, this is WCW, so you KNOW that they're going to cut away from the match to show us a non-related something... only this time it's actually \*\*\*\*ing AWESOME! Okay, so remember how I've mentioned over the past couple of weeks that Heenan's doing business with Sonny Onoo was planting the seeds for one of Starrcade's major storylines? Well, this is the next step in that storytelling, as Onoo is back at his table, only now he has guests: Masahiro Chono, Masa Saito, Jushin Liger, Kensuki Sasaki, and yes, before you ask, this is indeed leading to a series of WCW vs NJPW matches down the line! See? I TOLD you this was going some place awesome! We return from the surprisingly awesome distraction just in time to see Eddie make the fired up comeback to define all fired up comebacks, and I swear, I can't help but wonder whether I'm accidentally watching this on fast forward, everything is so damn crisp and violently executed. It's so hard for me to really talk about because I just want to shut up, watch it, and then rewind and watch it again! The cherry on top of an already delicious bout is that the finishing sequence includes a callback to their LAST encounter, AND gives a good reason for a second rematch to occur later on down the line! Okay, so the first time (in WCW at least) these two wrestled, Benoit was able to put Eddie away with a Dragon Suplex. He goes to that well tonight as well, only Eddie has it scouted of this time, and counters it by running to the ropes and forcing the break. Benoit gets pissed, front suplexes him onto the top rope, and then tries to suplex him back into the ring, but Eddie is able to twist in midair and pick up the flash pinfall... except that the ref didn't notice that Benoit's foot was under the rope! Professional wrestling, I love you so much when you get to make this much sense. Why can't you ALWAYS make this much sense? 

  
RESULTS: Guerrero def. Benoit via pinfall

4: STING VS RIC FLAIR

  
GASP! WHAT A SURPRISE! I really thought we'd get to see Johnny B. Badd vs Big Bubba. The good news is, this is pretty much every Sting vs Flair match you've ever seen, only with the modifier of “Sting is SUPER PISSED”, which basically means the dude is putting extra oomph behind every bit of offense he's throwing. It hits all of the same notes you'd expect from this matchup - lots of begging off from Flair, lots of press slams from Sting - only with more intensity and urgency. That urgency is actually what allows Flair to finally gain control of the match, as Sting tries a Stinger Splash while they're outside of the ring, and winds up eating nothing but barricade to the sternum, ouch! This leads to a lot of the classic Flair spots - the chopping, the methodical offense, the Figure Four where he grabs the ropes for leverage - but then OOPS! Sting remembers that he is a fired up babyface AND super pissed, no sells the Figure Four while it's still locked in, and reverses it to escape. Flair tries striking back, all no sold. It's the kind of sh\*t I'd normally be roasting Hogan for, only here it has the context of “SUPER BLIND RAGE” so it actually works with the in ring storytelling. The finish of the match is ALSO in that same category of things I'd usually hate, but think works with the storytelling in this particular match: after surviving brass knuckles to the face, Sting goes on a SECOND no selling rage, crushing Flair with a Superplex, then finishing him off with the Scorpion Death Lock... except he is SO filled with rage over the (most recent) betrayal at Halloween Havoc that he refuses to let go of the hold. He wants to literally end Flair, and refuses to relinquish the hold as referees and babyfaces try to talk him back to good guy sanity. They seem to succeed, but nope! Sting just runs back into the ring to apply the Deathlock again... until Lex Luger of all people enters the ring, and somehow heel ass Luger manages to talk babyface ass Sting out of his angry violent submission rampage. The two leave together, and this can only mean one thing: STING HAS JOINED THE DUNGEON OF DOOM! Man, fantastic stuff here all around, both the match AND the angle.

  
RESULTS: Sting def. Flair via submission  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-MAIN EVENT TALKING: Okay, so remember how last week, we were supposed to find out how and why the Dungeon keeps claiming that Giant is the World champion, and the big reveal was “WE'LL TELL YOU NEXT WEEK MAYBE!!!”? Well, we FINALLY get the reasoning behind it: Jimmy Hart (“That Maggot” as Bischoff keeps calling him) had power of attorney over Hogan's contracts, and it turns out that Hart somehow added a clause to the title match that Hogan could lose the title on a DQ! TECH-NI-CALI-TY! CLAP CLAP CLAPCLAPCLAP! It takes the show all of about 5 seconds for this storyline to get shat all over, as Mean Gene HAPPENS to have a lawyer with him who confirms that while yes, this is a legit contract, Nick Bockwinkle (the figurehead of the WCW Championship Committee, who really SHOULD be doing this talking because he \*\*\*\*ing ruled) decided that the victory was so tainted that he was vacating the title, and the 60 man Battle Royal at World War III (which was supposed to be for a #1 contendership) will NOW be for the title! BOY, I'M SURE GLAD WE WAITED ONE WEEK FOR THIS!  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
PART 2 - WWF MONDAY NIGHT RAW 11/06/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Hooboy, this should be a treat... Jerry Lawler's not on commentary tonight, as he has a match later on in the show, so filling in for him is Dok “I Swear, I Used To Be One Of The Freebirds And Was Cool, Honest” Hendrix. Hayes is obviously legendary on the mic, but as this character? It's like Vince McMahon and Jim Ross merged into one loud, screaming, overly excited Southern entity.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: THE BRITISH BULLDOG (W/JIM CORNETTE) VS MARTY JANNETTY

  
You know my theory about 1995 Raw well by now, given that Bulldog is Hart family adjacent, and Marty is kind of sort of Kliq adjacent, this should be half as good as a Hart vs Kliq match in theory, right? Funny enough, this match flows almost like a bigger bodied version of the old era 205 Live matches: fast paced athletic action while Marty is in control, slow paced power moves while Bulldog is in control, it's basically the 1995 equivalent to watching Tony Nese fart around in a match with basically any non-luchadore CW face back in the era when 205 wasn't so great. And a lot like that era of matches, this is hardly must watch but still really good pro wrestling. We also learn two kinda important things during the match, which will affect future WWF content: (1) Bulldog actually got what he wanted, and will be facing the winner of Diesel vs Hart sometime down the line; (2) HBK has recovered from getting his ass kicked by between 4 and 6000 Marines, and was back in action on the house show loop over the weekend. I hope no ones spiteful younger brother gives him an enzuigiri any time soon! The finish to this one was pretty awesome, as was the work leading up to it which included Marty breaking out a move I've never seen him do before, basically a top rope rolling cutter. Kind of like a reverse Blockbuster, awesome spot. Anyhow, for the finish, Marty shows off his craftiness by going for a Flying Fist Drop, but turning it into a Flying Nothing as soon as he sees the Bulldog moving, and surprises him with a DDT that would have gotten 3 had Davey not been able to get his foot on the bottom rope. Bulldog also shows that he's not slouch in the experienced veteran department, dodging a charging Marty to send him shoulder first into the turnbuckles, and polishing him off with a Running Powerslam. Vince, of course, seems perplexed that Bulldog's finishing move was able to finish a match, because he is paid a lot of money to promote and talk about wrestling.

  
RESULTS: Bulldog def. Jannetty via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\--Here's your #LOLWhat moment of the week: a Bill Clinton impersonator announces that he'll be at Survivor Series, while Vince pretends he's the real (then) president. Based on Vince's commentary style, there's a 90% chance that he actually THINKS it's the president, and not an actor.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-That pointless interlude bought us just enough time to allow for Hendrix to get to the ring to interview Cornette and Bulldog. Apparently that title match vs whomever comes out of Survivor Series as champion in December, at In Your House. Also, the Wildcard match at Survivor Series has been changed so that now, it's 4 faces vs 4 heels. So... not a Wildcard match then?  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Footage from Superstars reveals that two awesome things happened in the same segment. Awesome thing 1 is that Lawler got to interview Goldust, which I imagine went way differently than it did after the Karate Fighters tournament finale in 1997, where homophobic slurs may have been dropped around quite liberally, ahem. Awesome thing number 2 is that Bam Bam Bigelow is back, and he's challenging Goldust to a match because reasons!So there we go, a Saturday B show was used to set up a side feud between a guy who Lawler would later call “queer”, and a guy who's skull and suit is flaming. Lots of homoeroticism can happen in the WWF!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: HENRY O. GODWIN VS SOME JOBBER

  
Wait a minute... That's not just “some jobber”... This meathead being billed as Terry Richards is a young, clean shaven RHYNO! If only Godwin were the warthog kinda pig farmer, this'd be GORE VS GORE! Anyhow, for something that is jobber squashtastic, this winds up being infinitely more watchable than your average Raw match. Probably because they didn't have to fill 8 minutes of time with bad punching and chinlocks. So while nothing much exciting happens (aside from Godwin draping Richards' neck over the bottom rope, getting on the apron, and dropping a Guillotine Drop, that was pretty choice), there's still enough urgency to the work to make it look like it's two dudes trying to win a wrestling match as opposed to farting around killing time. Godwin picks up the win with the Slop Drop, and Richards presumably goes backstage to find the crackers and spray cheese.

  
RESULTS: Godwin def. Richards via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, Hunter Hearst Helmsley turns babyface (in my eyes anyway) by sneaking up on Godwin for an attack, and hitting him with the Pedigree right on the floor! As a sick but also pretty great followup, Helmsley decides to slop the unconscious farmer, but not before putting on rubber gloves so that no part of the filthy bucket would touch his flesh! Huh, who knew that the future HHH was always pretty \*\*\*\*ing awesome?  
\-Oh sh\*t, the WWE Network version of this episode actually contains a commercial for the console versions of Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, and if you haven't ever seen that, it's kind of a stupid but fun treat. Picture a hybrid of a wrestling game and Mortal Kombat, complete with digitized characters, and ridiculous sh\*t like Doink lighting people up full Raiden style using a high voltage joy buzzer, and Undertaker LITERALLY hitting foes over the head with an actual Tombstone! It was a stupid game, but it also kinda ruled.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Todd Petengil handles the Slam Jam for Dok this week, and we learn that not only will Undertaker return for Survivor Series, but he'll be part of a very random (if you don't know about the backstage relationships) traditional elimination tag match: It'll be Taker teaming up with Fatu, Godwin and Savio Vega taking on the team of King Mabel, Helmsley, Lawler and Isaac Yankem. Or to put it in backstage relationships parlance, it's members of the Bone Street Krew vs CWA/USWA (Memphis wrestling) alumni. With Hunter thrown in to round out the numbers, because he's feuding with a pig farmer. We also get Paul Bearer shrieking random words, and Undertaker talking in his usual Satanic Grover voice, to put over that tag match, with Taker conducting the whole promo with his back turned to the camera to hide his spooky Phantom Of The Opera face. Plus Diesel has words for Bret Hart, and takes way too long to say “I'm going to win”, but hey, Nash on the mic is great so even that is entertaining for what it was.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: KAMA (W/TED DIBIASE) VS SOME JOBBER

  
OH THANK GAWD! You may think I'm being sarcastic, but this week has really been light on things I could nominate for Lowlight of the Week. I was really scratching my head at what match would get that dishonor, but this one seems like a sure lock in to me! Kama, for those who are unfamiliar with his work, is currently in what is probably the least memorable of his gimmicks: the Supreme Fighting Machine, a lame attempt at cashing in on the underground popularity the UFC was enjoying amongst blood thirsty fighting fans (years before it became a mainstream thing). This is after he was a voodoo priest, but before he would become a black militant, or a pimp. I'm honestly unsure of which of those gimmicks is most racist. If you've ever watched Kama during his days as Papa Shango or The Godfather, you probably know that he was much better at the “Entertainment” part of “Sports Entertainment”, and here we don't even get much of THAT, so... yeah, just a lot of farting around and taking way too long to put away a jobber with bad “martial arts” “strikes” and “throws”, where the most exciting thing to happen was Shawn Michaels doing a phone in interview to discuss Survivor Series, and to take a huge sh\*t over him having to relinquish the IC title due to concussion by saying that it really wasn't a big dea and that he's used to walking around all “disorientated”. Hmmmm, I wonder why THAT is?!?!?! I'd make a drug reference joke here, but that would be a little to up the nose. Er, I mean ON the nose. Yeah. Kama finishes the match with a right handed punch, because he is apparently the world's shortest Big Show.

  
RESULTS: Kama def. Jobber via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-And now for the real highlight of the show: MORE KARATE FIGHTERS ACTION!!!! Brothers Bart and Billy Gunn preview their (spoiler alert) split up in 1997 two years early by having it out in a TOY BATTLE, and I honestly think that them playing toys is probably more important than the actual break up angle was. Billy proves that he is better at toys than Bart, and don't think of this as a sad day for mustaches and mullets, think of this as a happy day for future Honky Tonk Man protegees and homosexual tag team specialists who aren't really gay.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: MAIN EVENT: JERRY LAWLER AND ISAAC YANKEM, D.D.S. VS BRET HART AND HAKUSHI (W/BARRY HOROWITZ)

  
This match is basically the punchline to a joke no one's ever written, I think it starts out with “A king, a dentist, a Japanese mystical monk, a Jew, and a Canadian who doesn't know that professional wrestling isn't real walk into an arena...” Another funny thing I wanted to point out: on his way to the ring, Bret handed his sunglasses to a little girl who was there with her mother, and after having read Bret's autobiography several times, I'd say there's roughly a 90% chance that he wound up \*\*\*\*ing the sh\*t out of that mom after the show, in one of his many many many acts of marital infidelity. This match has kind of an interesting dynamic going on honestly. On one hand, the heel team are both masters of the WWF kicky punchy chinlocky style. On the other hand, Hart and Hakushi are \*\*\*\*ing super workers, Lawler is an ace at bumping his ass off and throwing working punches, and Yankem is still young enough here to be powerful and still surprisingly athletic, so it all adds up to a match that is way better in practice than it might look on paper. Besides, how many other matches will you watch where you can say that you witnessed Jinsei Shinzaki hit Kane with a \*\*\*\*in handspring back elbow? It's almost as refreshing as watching Hakushi (who is your face in peril here) getting slammed into the ring apron without hearing the words “THE HARDEST PART OF THE RING!” being shoved down our throats! I'd also like to point out that Lawler is in absolute d\*ckish heel mode here, as he basically doesn't come into the match until right at the end, hits Hakushi with not one but TWO piledrivers, but opts to taunt Bret instead of go for the pin, so that he could cause the ref to become distracted by Bret storming the ring, and he and Yankem could doubleteam the presumably comatose Hakushi, who honestly probably would BE an actual White Angel (or an angel of some kind) if he took two piledrivers for a shoot. Great d\*ck heel stuff though, I approve! And in perhaps my favorite moment of the whole match, Hakushi is able to create some separation (SO glad that line isn't being overused in 1995) by taking advantage of Lawler's comedic overselling. No seriously, he catches Lawler with a punch counter to a Flying Double Axehandle, and Lawler sells it by clutching his throat like he was garroted, flopping like a fish, and dry humping the ring! Bret takes the hot tag, fires up on the heels, lands three of his Five Moves Of Doom on Yankem (bulldogging headlock, Russian Legsweep, middle rope Elbow Drop), and then they move into the STUPID OVERBOOKED FINISH! Bret locks Yankem in the Sharpshooter, Lawler tries to break it up but gets cut off by Hakushi. For some reason, the ref gets SUPER HEEL BIASED and/or possibly racist, choosing to reprimand Hakushi but NOT Lawler, and thus missing out on seeing Yankem tap out years before that would actually mean anything. Lawler takes advantage of the situation by grabbing a PLASTIC CHAIR like you'd find in a school classroom, and STOP IT JERRY, YOU'RE MAKING IT TOO EASY FOR ME TO MAKE PEDOPHILE JOKES! But yeah, Lawler goes to moderately hurt Hart with hard plastic, but Horowitz makes the save, shoving the King down and disarming him. Naturally, THIS is the moment where the ref turns around, sees Barry with the chair(y), and disqualifies the faces. WOMP WOMP! They had it coming honestly, I'm 99% sure that having Barry Horowitz in your corner only leads to a victory if you're facing Chris Candido.

  
RESULTS: Lawler and Yankem def. Hart and Hakushi via DQ  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
TV RATINGS: Raw def. Nitro 2.6-2.0 - Okay then, if you want proof that popular opinion does not necessarily equate to show quality, scope out those ratings! Nitro put on what was objectively a MUCH better show, where even the worst match was a pretty fun, hard hitting squash (I don't count Giant chokeslamming Cobra as a match), the final two matches on the show were \*\*\*\*ing AWESOME, and even the non-wrestling parts, as stupid as they were, wound up being a lot of fun. Raw was really good on the most part as well, but nothing more important (in terms of forwarding storylines) happened than “A pig \*\*\*\*ing redneck got hoisted by his own slop bucket petard”, the two actual good matches were not on the same level as Nitro's good stuff, and the two squash matches were DEFINITELY not on that level either. So yeah, THIS is why I don't trust ratings to tell me how good or bad a show was. Still, great week of wrestling television all around!  


  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK: If I even have to tell you, then I \*\*\*\*ing give up. I'm going to tell you anyway mind you, the obvious answer of Eddie/Benoit is the only answer I COULD give, I'm just saying, if you couldn't come to that conclusion by me ranting and raving about the match like so much Meltzer whacking it to puroresu, then I have failed in my duty as a writer.  


  
LOWLIGHT OF THE WEEK: Thank you Charles Wright, for being a terrible wrestler in any gimmick, AND working a bad squash match while using the one gimmick that DIDN'T involve you showing enough character work to keep things interesting. I look forward to the time where you stop looking like Sinbad (the comedian, not the Arabian guy) playing MMA guy, and start developing a love of colorful hats, fatties, and trains of a prostitutional variety.  


  
NEXT WEEK: Macho Man takes on Meng, in what is certain to be a barnburner (in that you'd rather lock yourself in a barn and set it on fire than watch this \*\*\*\*ing match probably), plus Hogan manages to outdo his insanity with ANOTHER promo spot that'll require me to post a YouTube link to prove that I am not lying or hallucinating! Raw counters this by giving us Razor Ramon vs Sycho Sid (don't question his spelling, he has half the brain that you do), with special guest referee Razor Ramon's Good Buddy The 1-2-3 Kid! Who I'm sure will be a fair and impartial referee, ahem.

PART 1 - WCW MONDAY NITRO 11/13/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Holy \*\*\*\*, talk about getting to the fireworks factory right away... We kick things off with a brief commentary team pre-amble about the World title scene, and then transition into the most insane thing you'll see on this show! Okay, so remember how last week, Hogan and Savage cut a coke addled vignette where they were hanging out with the homeless (and a KKK musician - no, I'm not explaining the context of that joke), and plotting to turn Savage into a mole to decide who is and isn't on Hogan's side? If you were wondering how he could possibly top this, here's your answer: by cutting a promo in a graveyard, dressed like he's going to an Eyes Wide Shut orgy party, brandishing a \*\*\*\*ing BROADSWORD, and screaming sh\*t that makes him sound like a Sailor Moon villain! I kind of want to just gloss over this and let you check out the link I'm about to post, because I doubt anyone (myself included, and I'm WATCHING IT NOW) will believe a word I say, but I ALSO kind of want to write an 8 page essay about how ridiculous all of this is, so I'll just go to the middle ground and provide a bullet point synopsis. (1) Apparently the Dungeon of Doom is powered by some entity called the Doom, which seems to possess you through inhaling it (???) by his verbiage. The Doom, however, is afraid of Hulkamania, because of the training, prayers and Vitamins. So there you go, apparently all you need to do in order to vanquish the DoD is hit the gym, take up a theistic worldview, and inject “Vitamins” into your arm/butt. Possibly Vitamin HGH, ahem. (2) He wants Macho to LITERALLY DECAPITATE Meng, and deliver his Tongan head on a silver platter (!!!!). (3) Because Sting listened to advice from longtime friend Lex Luger and stopped trying to break Ric Flair in half, now Hogan is unsure of whether he's on the side of the Church of Gymnasiums and Pills, or whether he's inhaled the Doom, so he's going to try to discern this for himself. And if Sting IS DoD 4 Life, his name will be moved up to the top of the list of people who Hogan is going to LITERALLY \*\*\*\*ING MURDER! (4) WHAT THE \*\*\*\*?!?!?!?! WHO THE \*\*\*\* THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?!?!?!?! To put this into modern context, imagine if Roman Reigns was wrestling Brock Lesnar for, like, the 800th time or whatever. He winds up getting gang raped by Brock and, I don't know, Great Khali dressed up like a Frankenstein for some reason. Seth Rollins and Braun Strowman make the save, but Strowman turns on Rollins, and Seth ALSO gets gang raped. Now imagine if a couple of weeks later, Roman is hanging out in, I don't know, say an abattoir, wielding a battle axe and dressed like he's going to some Fist of the North Star themed post-apocalypse orgy, cutting wild promos about how he wants Rollins to literally disembowel Elias, and that next week, he's going to determine whether super good guy Finn Balor (who's had a friendly relationship with Braun in the past) is face or heel and threatens to murder him if he's not with Roman. Would that make you invested in any of the storylines involving these people in any way whatsoever? ....Crap, I think I just sh\*t over my own point, because that scenario sounds \*\*\*\*ing AWESOME compared to what we usually get on Raw nowadays! So I'm just going to shut my damn mouth and post the link because again, this sh\*t is too crazy to be believed without seeing it first hand.

  
r/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNhRJgUC9lc  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Oh, and the BEST part of all of this is that when we go back to the commentary team, no one even MENTIONS the insanity that this video even contained! Instead it's just Heenan predicting that Hogan will be the first eliminated in the 60 man Battle Royal (LOL as if), and Bischoff and Mongo being SUPER up Hogan's ass about how he deserves an infinite amount of title shots because of how screwed over he was! I'm 99% sure that they cut to the video but never actually watched it themselves!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: DECAPITATION MATCH (PRESUMABLY): MENG (W/KEVIN SULLIVAN) VS MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE

  
BAHAHA! I've seen this episode a few times over the years, how the \*\*\*\* did I never notice that Macho is being billed as “From The Dark Side Of Venice Beach”?!?!?! Not to go all bullet point/numbered list on you guys again, but; (1) What the \*\*\*\* does that even mean? (2) Did going evil make Macho move from Sarasota, Florida to the most Satanic part of California he could find? (3) Isn't Macho supposed to be masquerading as a good guy/Hogan's Super Spy, meaning he probably SHOULDN'T be blatantly using terms like “Dark Side” in his billing? (4) Apparently not, apparently the announce team DID see that promo when it aired last week, and Bischoff just openly goes “Savage is here to find out who's with and against Hogan!” (5) WHAT THE \*\*\*\* IS ANY OF THIS?!?!?!?! Also, notice how I'm avoiding any discussion of the match itself? Well, there's a reason for it... Okay, remember that lazy match Savage had against Kurosawa awhile back, where it was basically just Savage getting beaten up by bad WWF offense until it was time for Macho to win, and then he won the match with two moves? This isn't as one sided, as Savage comes out through the crowd (instead of down the entrance ramp) to blindside Meng, but yeah, it's just Savage doing bad 80's WWF style offense until Meng takes over, followed by Meng controlling with bad 80's WWF style offense, until it's time for Savage to win. The way that happens is that Savage dodges a Meng Diving Headbutt, this causes Jimmy Hart (who came out in the middle of the match) to get up on the apron. Savage tosses Meng into Hart, hits a Northern Lariat, and lands the Big Elbow for the win. I'm sad that no one gets decapitated here, and even MORE sad that Sullivan doesn't respond to that promo by trying to harvest the right arm of Savage, because it is strong enough to win wrestling matches in two \*\*\*\*ing moves.

  
RESULTS: Savage def. Meng via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, I almost get my wish! Shark and Luger come out for the Damned Numbers Game assault, and Luger injures Savage's left arm (WRONG ARM DUDE!) by slamming it into the turnbuckle post, as well as the guardrail.   


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: KENSUKE SASAKI VS CHRIS BENOIT

  
Holy sh\*t, how dope would this match have been if Kensuke (or “Kensuki” as he's called in the graphics, because WCW was never very good with Japanese names; see also “Ultimate Dragon” later on) didn't come out to the standard fare racist “ching ching chong chong” music that most Japanese wrestlers were given? Even more importantly, how \*\*\*\*ing dope would this match be if it got more than, like, 2 and a half minutes? The good news is that for only getting a bit more air time than Hogan's angry midlife crisis promo, it's still REALLY \*\*\*\*ing good! Just think of it not as a full match, but like a highlight reel for a hypothetical NJPW style match between these two: two minutes of them hitting each other with hard chops, stiff ass lariats, and crisp slams. Although Sasaki would go on to become a multiple time IWGP Heavyweight champion in his career, here he has less experience than Benoit, and that plays out in the finish: Benoit is able to flip out of a Backdrop attempt, get the waistlock, and put his foe away with his biggest finishing sequence to date - two Rolling Germans transitioned into a Dragon Suplex. Holy sh\*t, this was WAY too good to deserve such a short run time, and I hope that they get a longer rematch down the line that I've completely forgotten about.

  
RESULTS: Benoit def. Sasaki via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Also, here's a great “Wait, WHAT?!?!?!” moment for you: after the match, while the show is just about to cut to commercial break, Bischoff just causally drops that Benoit is in the Four Horsemen now. Wait, WHAT?!?!?! I knew that he was going to become part of the group here real soon, but did they seriously just have him join on one of the syndicated shows, and devoted 0.1 seconds to letting us know about it, without any fanfare or context? THANKS WCW! You sure made the second most controversial Horseman of all time seem important! Note: Despite Benoit's legacy of being a shoot murderer, I still maintain that Paul Roma is the more heinous and controversial member, and I will FIGHT YOU IN REAL LIFE if you disagree! (But not really!)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: TV TITLE MATCH: JOHNNY B. BADD (C) VS EDDIE GUERRERO

  
And now, the match that, on paper anyway, I'd want to have the 2.5 minute runtime and give the leftover minutes to Benoit/Sasaki! Note that I say “on paper”, because this winds up turning into a REALLY GOOD \*\*\*\*ING MATCH! The fun catch to these TV title matches is that they come with a built in 10 minute time limit, which always adds both a fun twist to the in ring storytelling, as well as forces a sense of urgency out of the competitors, because they know they only have a very limited window of time to win. And this match manages to hit that urgency level that it needed in order to be a believable “Oh sh\*t, I have 10 minutes to win this title” story, it has the advantage of a hot crowd who is SUPER into everything both men are doing, AND it pulls off a mix of incredible action and fantastic in ring storytelling, using my favorite face vs face trope: both men starting out with high octane mat wrestling (and some high flying maneuvers as well), and then sh\*t gets HEATED UP after one guy delves into semi-heel territory, causing the friendly wrestling match to devolve more into an angry brawl. In this case, it's former heel Badd who fills that role. Through the earlier portions of the match, he almost responds to Eddie getting the better of him on exchanges by throwing the old boxer punches, but stops himself every time, because this isn't a heated rivalry and he wants to wrestle a more honest, honorable bout. However, as the match progresses, Badd gets progressively more and more frustrated with his inability to outwrestle or put away his challenger. He starts by throwing a few European Uppercuts, which is fine I guess because it's a forearm or something, but then shortly after, he's throwing a few more things: (1) a few left and right hooks; (2) his babyface integrity RIGHT out of the window! Eddie responds by rolling out to the apron, clutching his face, taking a moment to collect his thoughts, and then FIRING THE \*\*\*\* UP once he returns to the ring, landing a double leg takedown and just ground and pounding the sh\*t out of Badd. The match turns into a spirited brawl from here, and it works on multiple levels from me. Main two levels: (1) It's such a perfect set up of the“straight up wrestling match goes awry and turns into a heated fight” trope, creating very logical context for why two do gooders would temporarily lose their heads; (2) It ALSO creates the context for why this match winds up going to the time limit draw. With both men angry and trying to see who can rain down more punches on the other, neither man is really focused on the whole “winning a wrestling match” thing, time slips away from them, and by the time the ref is able to calm both men down enough to get back to playing nice, OOPS, we only have two minutes left to go! Both men give it their all to put the other away, but nope, it's too little too late, and Badd is able to retain his title due to time limit draw. The post-match is simple but fantastic as well, as it hammers home the idea that these two are only good guys who temporarily lost their cool: the last 10 seconds of the match devolved into the two faces brawling once more, but once the ref is able to separate them and give them a chance to cool off, they shake hands and hug. A+ stuff here my friends, this really hammers home my newfound talking point of “Guys, Marc Mero was actually a REALLY GOOD WRESTLER, I swear!” As well as my eternal shame for not being an Eddie fan at this point in his career because sh\*t, the dude is so clearly better than everyone on the roster NOT named Chris Benoit right now.

  
RESULTS: Time Limit Draw  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-The Darkside of Hulkamania storyline continues, through offhand commentary exposition! Bischoff informs us that next week, Hogan will be on Nitro, and he's laid out a challenge! Quick, quiz time, who do you think Hogan wants to face off with next week? Is it The Giant, the man who broke his neck twice, shaved his mustache, and was part of the conspiracy to take his World title away? Is it Kevin Sullivan, the leader of this Hanna Barbara cartoon horror group who has been antagonizing him? Is it The YET-TAY, the massive mummy who \*\*\*\*ed he and Savage? Is it Jimmy Hart, the man who singlehandedly cost him the title and double crossed him? Is it Luger, the man who double crossed Savage and tried to break his arm? If you answered yes to any of those, then you clearly aren't paying attention to how insane Hogan is right now. Of course it's none of these, Hogan wants STING, the most trustworthy, Neutral Good type in the \*\*\*\*ing promotion! It's a wonder that Sting didn't decide to get way too into Brandon Lee cult films and live in the rafters like a year sooner than he actually did!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-More Dungeon time, as Mean Gene interviews Sullivan, Hart and Giant, and for some reason he's only getting around to telling Hart off for his betrayal NOW?!?!?! Good Gawd Gene, you may have one of the most iconic voice in wrestling broadcast history, but a broadcast journalist you are not! There's not much to talk about here in terms of the promo, as it's mostly just putting over the 60 man Battle Royal, but I have to say, Hart wearing a black suit while holding his old airbrushed Hogan jacket is pretty damn choice as far as d\*ckhead heel moves go. Also super choice is Sullivan once again flopping to the mat like a fish while Giant talks about destroying Hogan, only this time he also does the Hulk Hogan “cup my hand to my ear” taunts to really hammer it home! It's a little on the nose but also SUPER HILARIOUS! And somehow way less embarrassing than... You know, graveyard broadsword Phantom of the Opera swinger party promos about shoot murder.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: MAIN EVENT: DEAN MALENKO VS STING

  
Man, outside of our opening match, they really made sure to load this episode up with the best wrestlers in the promotion, and spreading them out to as many matches as possible, didn't they? If you want to see a real contrast between 1995 Savage and 1995 Sting, consider this: our opening match was Savage doing the most boring wrestling possible, and then making his opponent look like a complete goober by taking 70% of the offense in his match and then winning in two moves. Sting, meanwhile, faces a guy who is MUCH lower on the totem pole than himself, and decides to become a wrestling altruist, letting Malenko look like his peer! Don't get me wrong, Sting shows off his size and power advantage throughout the match, as you'd expect, but he doesn't just take Malenko to the woodshed and beat him for 99% of the match (like so much Hogan vs Billy Kidman, ahem...), nor does he let Malenko take him to the woodshed for 99% of the match, and then negate that entire effort by no selling and/or winning in two moves. Here he lets Malenko take advantage of the match through superior knowledge of technical wrestling, and enacting a logical gameplan of “This guy's bigger, so I'm going to take out his legs and cut him down to my size”. The match winds up being a back and forth affair where both men are able to control the match due to being superior in one attribute than the other, until their opponent is able to use their OWN superior attribute to turn things around, and it's pretty damn dope! And the icing on the cake is that Sting only wins by briefly seeing a flaw in Malenko's gameplan and exploiting it! Malenko thinks that he's gotten Sting gassed and hurting enough to go for the Cloverleaf, but Sting has enough of his wits about him to seize Dean as he bends down to lock it in, slip him into an Inside Cradle, and pick up the flash pinfall out of nowhere! Damn, if the wrestling on Nitro always made this much sense, I'd probably be watching this on the WCW Network or something, I swear.

  
RESULTS: Sting def. Malenko via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, Mean Gene interviews Sting, and lets him know about Hogan's new found unneccesary hatred and match challenging. Sting makes me smile by bringing up a PAST wrestling promo where Hogan called him a “little dog on the front porch” (NICE!), calls himself THE BIG DAWG (or rather A big dog), and says that while he doesn't want to fight Hogan, he'll do it if he has to. Gene shows what an impartial broadcaster he is by saying “Hogan says that you betrayed him and are working with evil Lex Luger, you're a lying piece of sh\*t, aren't you?” I'm paraphrasing but holy sh\*t... Between Mongo, Bischoff, and now Okerlund, that's a lot of people who are wedged super far up Hogan's ass here.   


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
PART 2 - WWF MONDAY NIGHT RAW 11/13/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Note: In my “Next Week” section of my last review, I think I forgot to mention that this is the go home show for Survivor Series. I guess we shall see whether this holds up to the WWE's usual track record of presenting lacking go homes, right?  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Also, the show kicks off in cold open form with an IMMEDIATE BAIT AND SWITCH! You see, 1-2-3 Kid is the guest referee for the IC title match between Razor Ramon and Sycho “I Can't Spell Psycho Properly” Sid, but over the weekend (on syndicated tv), Razor and Kid... gasp... Started hating on each other yet again! I know, it's a shock, we've only seen it, what, two or three times thus far since I started these \*\*\*\*ing reviews? Anyhow, because WWF President Gorilla Monsoon is now worried about Kid's ability to be an impartial referee, he's REVOKED THE TITLE MATCH, so this is now a non-title affair, and Sid is getting hosed over someone else's actions. Three talking points here. (1) If you ever wanted to see how much of a prototype Monsoon is for the Biased Babyface WWE Authority Figure (see: Kurt Angle, Shane McMahon, Daniel Bryan, Paige to a degree), look no further than this. Because the man he assigned as the guest referee might wind causing trouble for the babyface IC champion, now the heel challenger doesn't get to go for the belt? Instead of, you know, removing Kid from the match and replacing him with a more partial referee? (2) Also, even if this rift between Kid and Razor hadn't happened, how is it that Kid is only NOW considered to be possibly impartial? He and Razor were BEST FRIENDS! Does impartiality only count if you're going to screw the babyface champion maybe? (3) #LOLWhat?!?!?! Seriously though, I love and miss Monsoon as much as the next guy, but \*\*\*\* this specific version of Gorilla \*\*\*\*ing Monsoon! Worst president EVER! Well, if you ignore certain people who've been in charge of the Oval Office...  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: HUNTER HEARST HELMSLEY VS HENRY O. GODWINN

  
....Can I just watch that promo with Hogan in the graveyard on loop for 10 minutes and review that instead? I'll say this much, I love Hunter's viciousness right at the onset of the match, knocking Godwinn off of the apron with a jumping knee while Wrestling Hog Farmer is trying to get into the ring, hitting him with a baseball slide, and then slamming him into the ring steps, awesome start! And then... sigh... and also ugh... Godwinn reacts to this by grabbing the slop bucket and SLOPPING HIMSELF WITH IT?!?!?! What... the... WHAT THE \*\*\*\*?!?!?! He starts chasing Hunter, who wants no part of this slop covered pig \*\*\*\*er, but Wrestling Blue Blood winds up slipping in slop out on the floor, because HUMOR! You know, humor if you're 8, have an IQ of under 70, or are Vince McMahon. Anyhow, the match does end in the best way possible - with both men running backstage with no actual match happening, so I can only hate on this so much.

  
RESULTS: No Contest due to Double Count Out  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Because even in 1995, Vince still seemed to have a massive Kid Crush (of the Heartbreak kind!) on Shawn Michaels, we get a random video package about HBK. Here's a bit of a real talk question: whenever Vince calls Michaels “the most resilient”, am I the only one who hears “Brazilian” 90% of the time, thanks to Vince's inability to pronounce basic words properly? (See also: Ladies and Gentlemen becoming “LADIES AND GENNAMEN!”, or “Ultimate Warrior” becoming “ALTIMENT WOYER!”) This isn't even a recent thought either, even as a teen in 1995, I used to wonder why Vince thought HBK was from Brazil. Anyhow, yeah, this is basically just the WWF giving Shawn a blowjob in video package form, I just wanted to bring it up for the Brazilian thing.   


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: AHMED JOHNSON VS SOME JOBBER

  
Because we didn't JUST see a video package for HBK, here's a match where 33% of it is a picture-in-picture HBK promo! I was getting ready to hate on this match, because Ahmed Johnson, but it's really hard to hate on something that only takes such a small fraction of tv time. The match is basically just Ahmed registering but no selling strikes, hitting one clothesline, one back elbow (that looks like it connected hard enough to give Sir Jobbington a concussion, again, because Ahmed Johnson), one surprisingly gorgeous looking Spinebuster, and the Pearl River Plunge, called “the Tiger Bomb” by Vince... which is a rare example of Vince actually getting the name of a move right while ALSO getting it completely wrong. As a bit of a hot take, I can honestly see why wrestling fans in the mid 90's ate up Johnson (intentionally sexual phrasing, boom!) like they did, before his many injuries in '96 and '97, plus him having to compete in longer matches absolutely exposed him. He was basically the prototype Goldberg here: the big bald guy in non-descript tights who would just show up and absolutely wreck someone's Christmas, New Year AND Easter in short, brutal fashion. The biggest thing that WCW learned from the Ahmed experience was to never let Goldberg actually try to talk because holy \*\*\*\*, if you've ever heard an Ahmed promo, you know that he makes Chris Benoit sound like Dusty Rhodes by comparison!

  
RESULTS: Johnson def. Jobber via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Speaking of the merits of never letting your bald jobber destroyer talk, here is Ahmed getting a chance to talk! This was actually one of his better promos, by which I mean it was short, and I was able to understand like 40% of the words he used. Of course, some of those words were “don't you dare be coming into the ring half stepping G”, so... Even the words I can make out are impossible to truly understand?  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Up next is a sit down interview with both Diesel and Bret Hart. In picture-in-picture, “delivered via satellite” form, which is cool with me, it's a great way to add some last minute heat to their title match without giving away a physical confrontation for free. Also, LOLx100 at McMahon for referring to Diesel as “Big D”. I wish they would have gone with that nickname in a very Attitude Era manner. “LADIES AND GENNAMEN, TUNE INTO SURVIVOR SERIES THIS SUNDAY TO SEE BRET “THE HITMAN” HOTT GET \*\*\*\*ED BY THE BIG D!” I don't even know what to make of this promo, from an alignment perspective, because it's mostly just two guys being super humble but ALSO being super braggadocios at the same time. A lot of “my opponent is really good, but actually I'm the best.” If anything, Bret actually comes off more like the heel here, as he's cutting a bit of a prototype version of his 1997 run (which is his HIGHEST Pokemon evolution), just making excuses and saying “Well actually, I should be champion because I never REALLY lost the title.” Also, heels are the ones who lie, and Bret referred to Kevin Nash as being a “great wrestler”, and that might be the MOST bullsh\*t thing he's ever said. Overall though, I actually really like the vibe of this segment. It sounds less like two pro wrestlers cutting pro wrestling promos with each other, and more like two real human beings talking in their natural talking voices, with their natural cadence, and having a half civil, half up their own ass passive aggressive conversation about their upcoming match. Pro wrestling needs more segments like this when it comes to putting over marquee matches.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Well, I'm glad I didn't declare that interview to be the (probably) best thing we'll see on tonight's show, because we follow that up with VINCE MCMAHON AND JERRY LAWLER PLAYING TOYS!!!!!! I want to put like 50 more exclamation marks at the end of that sentence just to put over how surreal, ludicrous, and \*\*\*\*ing AWESOME that is!!!! Anyhow, yeah, it's time once again for our weekly Karate Fighters segment, and despite the fact that Vince is the clandestine owner of the company, Lawler manages to pick up the fair Karate Fighters victory. It's never said on the show, but I heard that he may have employed some help from a few 13 year olds, to show him how to play with his toy. Ahem. Anyhow, all “Jerry Lawler was legit charged with raping an underaged girl” jokes aside, it actually comes out that Jerry DIDN'T win fair and square, and that he CHEATED, taping the foot of his Karate Man down so that he couldn't actually get knocked over! GASP! My favorite part about this is that McMahon doesn't demand a rematch, nor a reversed decision, he instead uses this time to PLUG SURVIVOR SERIES and put over how \*\*\*\*ed Lawler is going to be! Actually, scratch that, my favorite part is still that this is VINCE MCMAHON PLAYING WITH TOYS AND LOOKING LIKE HE'S HAVING FUN!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: KING MABEL (W/SIR MO) VS SOME JOBBER

  
And now, the polar opposite of “the best thing on the show”! On the plus side, before we get to see Mabel inaction, we do get a pre-recorded Undertaker promo where once again, he proves why he always had Paul Bearer do the talking for him: it's pretty hard to take someone as a serious threat when they sound like \*\*\*\*ing Satanic death metal Grover. Anyhow, the match goes WAY too long for being a squash, it's 99% Mabel no selling one dropkick and hitting bad looking strikes, and the most exciting thing to happen is one big flying clothesline (which IS impressive from the big man), sold by the jobber like he was in AJPW taking a Backdrop Driver and landing on his \*\*\*\*ing head. Mabel puts him away with a Belly to Belly, and at least that's a finish I can buy.

  
RESULTS: Mabel def. Jobber via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Here's yet another #LOLWhat moment of the night: we get a video package with the fake Bill Clinton (that McMahon thought was the real deal last week) hyping up how he's going to be at Survivor Series... and then they completely sh\*t on the significance of this by SHOWING A DISCLAIMER STATING THAT THIS IS AN ACTOR! “Hey kids, I hope you all give a \*\*\*\* about this guy who's not the President but is acting like the President!” Yeah, THAT'LL put some butts in the seats! Suddenly my joke about Bret Hart getting \*\*\*\*ed by the Big D is sounding like a lot more of a serious draw...  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: MAIN EVENT - SYCHO SID (W/TED DIBIASE) VS RAZOR RAMON; SPECIAL GUEST REFEREE 1-2-3 KID

  
Phew, I think I have a modern WWE style chant to describe a lot of this match... KICKY PUNCHY! CLAP CLAP CLAPCLAPCLAP! ALSO CHINLOCKS! CLAP CLAP CLAPCLAPCLAP! Anyhow, the story here is that Kid is ACTUALLY pretty impartial as a ref, and while he doesn't really do anything biased throughout the match, he seems to favor Razor based on his body language, facial expressions, etc. Yep, I'm sure glad that Monsoon took the title match element away out of fear that Kid would \*\*\*\* Razor! (As opposed to Lawler, who is more likely to \*\*\*\* a kid!) (I swear, I'll eventually stop making these jokes maybe!) And yeah, with that, I really feel like I just want to skip to the finish because this is SO \*\*\*\*ING BORING! Like it's not BAD wrestling per se, but it's so boring you'll probably forget that wrestling is happening every time you blink your eyes. As an added something or another, Dean Douglas shows up mid match, and attacks Razor on the floor, while Kid is distracted by having to argue about Sid with something. Possibly about the merits of softball, or creative things you can do with scissors. Kid, once again, shows how EVIL and DEVIOUS and WANTING TO SCREW RAZOR OVER he is by... counting a normal speed 10 count while Razor's on the floor. And by making very fair, normal speed counts on Sid pin attempts. Yep, this 1-2-3 Kid is going to \*\*\*\* Razor over, NO IC TITLE MATCH FOR SID! Also, HOLY SHIT SID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!?! Dude legit almost derailed my thoughts mid sentence by selling an Elevator Drop by landing on his \*\*\*\*ing head AJPW style! Good GAWD! Aaaaaaand now to your random Overbooked, Oh \*\*\*\* Gorilla Monsoon Was Right All Along Because Reasons Finish Of The Week! Razor has Sid dead to rights (probably because he broke his neck trying to take a flat back bump somehow) and picks him up for the Razor's Edge, but Kid... GASP! Pulls Sid's leg in order to help him escape and land on his feet! Razor turns around, gets kicked in the gut, gets nailed with a Powerbomb, and Kid makes the SUPER FAST COUNT OF DOOM in order to crown a new Not-The-IC Champion Because This Was Non Title. 

  
RESULTS: Sid def. Ramon via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-There's no real post-match angle to speak of here, but there IS a great bit of character work I wanted to mention. So after the match, DiBiase does his old “stick money in my fallen opponent's mouth” thing to Razor, specifically a $5 Canadian bill... Which Kid winds up SWIPING OUT OF RAZOR'S MOUTH AND STUFFING INTO HIS POCKET! It's such a hilarious “Welp, I'm a heel now because reasons” thing to do, made even MORE funny when you realize how disappointed he's going to be once he discovers how little weed you can buy with $5 Canadian.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-We finish the show off with a brief attempt by Jim Ross to interview Dean Douglas (who's with Camp Cornette) about his sneak attack, but nothing really gets said here as Razor bursts into the locker room looking for Kid (insert Lawler joke here), and chases Douglas away.  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
TV RATINGS: Raw def. Nitro 2.6 - 2.0 HOW? WHY? HOW?!?!?! The literal only good things happening on Raw were the Bret/Diesel sitdown interview, the 1-2-3 Kid heel turn angle, and two middle aged commentators playing toys! Literally none of the matches delivered anything that you'd want to see once, let ALONE more than once. Nitro had it's more janky moments to be sure, but sh\*t, everything that wasn't the opening Macho Meng (see what i did there?) match was either legit good wrestling, or stupid but entertaining storytelling. If you want proof that people were tuning into Raw because of the WWF name, and not because of the actual content on the show, I think this week is a good example. And hey, that sounds like 2018 Raw as well!

  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: You KNOW I gotta give this one to Eddie G and Johnny BB. Yes, I know this makes me sound like a Caucasian making a lame attempt at being hip. Or at least what counted as hip in the late 80's. But anyhow, yeah, that match really did have so much of what makes professional wrestling worked: exciting moves, realistic brawling, great psychology, and a masterfully told in ring story. 

  
LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: I was prepared to give it to one of those final two Raw matches, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt like no, I couldn't sh\*t on them as much as you'd expect. Mabel squashing a jobber was about as bad as it gets, but it was still too short to truly be inoffensive. Razor/Sid was about as boring as pro wrestling can get, but it was all a means to an end in setting up the Kid heel turn, so it at least served some purpose. I'm giving the disgraceful nod to the Savage/Meng match. Sure, some of the same talking points I made about the Raw main event apply - mainly that it was a means to a storytelling end, in this case setting up Luger trying to break Savage's arm - but at least Razor/Sid didn't feel like a complete waste of time as far as matches go. Like it was boring, but at least it felt more like a competitive battle. Savage/Meng was just like 6 minutes of selling, followed by Savage popping an Elixir, healing to 100% HP , and then winning the match because it was time for him to win the match. My LEAST favorite kind of wrestling, if I'm being honest.  


  
NEXT WEEK: It's Survivor Series! In what has to be a Pat Patterson dream scenario, we shall see large groups of big, burly men GETTING IT ON! And Bret Hart is faced with the biggest challenge of his career... trying to get a good match out of Kevin Nash! Also, winning back the WWF title.

&amp;#x200B;

PART 1 - WCW MONDAY NITRO 11/20/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Before we begin, I just want to give Bobby Heenan major props for his hilarious analysis of tonight's main event: “I'm rooting for Sting. I hope he beats Hulk Hogan tonight, then I hope he trips, falls down the stairs, bangs his head, and they both eliminate each other!” Good Gawd how you are missed, Heenan. Even on shows like Hog Wild '96, when you spent half of the night at Scott Hall levels of drunk.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: SCOTT NORTON VS SHARK

  
Hey, remember how recently, these two men had an anti barnburner match that started as a potentially awesome hoss fight, but ended way too soon because neither man decided they wanted to win a wrestling match, and opted to fight to a double count out? Well, they're getting a second chance, let's see if they manage to put on a much better, proper wrestling mat...awwwww, it's over already. Seriously, the entire match is basically just Shark jumping Norton during his ring intro (thus robbing us of hearing “From Tsunami”, which is the biggest sin of the whole deal!), Shark doing a few moves to Norton in the ring, Norton firing back with some moves of his own, neither man bothering to do things like selling offense, and then Norton just winning with a “powerslam” like 2 minutes in. I use quotation marks because he kinda sorta completely dropped him, so for all intents and purposes, Norton picked up the win with the unbeatable combination of “bodyslam” and “falling down on top of a guy”. OKAY THEN! To give you an idea of how into wrestling psychology these guys absolutely aren't, Shark kicks out at 3, then almost immediately pops up, at 100% HP, and the two men have a brief shoving match, because sure, we absolutely need to see a part 3 to this mess!

  
RESULTS: Norton def. Shark

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Mean Gene is on hand at the entrance ramp to have words with Jimmy Hart and Kevin Sullivan. Hart goes on a great, Southern Mickey Mouse rant about how Hogan's done everything he could to steal Sting's thunder (very true), and actively root for Sting in tonight's main event. It's great, but it's also kinda terrible when you consider that Hogan's entire unreasonable premise is “Sting is friends with the Dungeon of Doom maybe because he listened to Lex Luger that one time”, and having the heels come out and actively cheerlead for the Stinger is kind of a heavy handed way to try and make us think that we should say “Wait, maybe Hogan's RIGHT!”, and to NOT think that he's lost his \*\*\*\*ing mind. It's the 1995 equivalent to having Maggle Cole cream his pants and yell “THE BIG DAWG!” whenever Roman is on screen, and the WWE wondering why this isn't making us love their Universal champion.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: EDDIE GUERRERO VS RIC FLAIR (W/BRIAN PILLMAN)

  
Before ring entrances can be made, Disco Inferno shows up to the entrance ramp to badly disco dance/look kinda like Rhonda Rousey when she's pointing at a Wrestlemania sign, and to show off a DISCO INFERNO MUSIC CD! So... He's supposed to be a musician who wrestles? And not just a guy who watched one too many Travolta movie and thought that qualified him to show up on a wrestling show, badly dance, and be a super underrated worker and character? Eddie shoos him away, which might be the most personality we've seen from him beyond getting fired up in the ring. Then half of the Horsemen show up, Pillman is dressed up like a prototype Shinsuke Nakamura, and Flair is dressed in street clothes. In a great bit of character work, it turns out that Flair is so focused on Sting that he feels like Eddie is too far beneath him to deserve tonight's match, and thus he's subbing Pillman in to take his place. So...  


&amp;#x200B;

  
ACTUAL 2: EDDIE GUERRERO VS BRIAN PILLMAN 

  
Man, this is one of those things that I didn't realize should have been hyped as a dream match at the time (and rest assured, the announcers do no such thing, because this isn't 2018 WWE, where EVERYTHING is some combination of “historic”, “first time ever”, or \*\*\*\*ing “dream match”!), but for long time wrestling nerds like myself, this really was a dream match of sorts for 1995. For here, we get kind of an incredible “old guard vs new guard” type matchup to sink our teeth into, one of the best high fliers of the early 90's vs one of the best high fliers of the late 90's. Not to mention two guys where were white meat as \*\*\*\* as babyfaces, but absolutely brilliant as heels, but I digress. Also, a huge +1 for heat gaining purposes/-1 for general racism for Pillman here, for him opening the match by grabbing his red jacket and waving it in front of the very Mexican Eddie like a \*\*\*\*ing matador. Could you imagine someone trying that in 2018? The internet would have lost their sh\*t in a ball of outrage like 5 seconds before it even happened! Which is kind of the point of heel heat, so... I guess good job to Pillman for that? As for the match itself, it doesn't play out exactly like that “old guard vs new guard” dream match type as it would have back in September, when Brian was still Flyin' with the angels, so to speak, but is still kind of a fantastic American interpretation of lucha libre at its core. Eddie is still lucha as \*\*\*\* in terms of his moveset, Brian works almost like an old school rudo, rarely dipping into the “doing exciting moves” well, but absolutely savaging the sh\*t out of Eddie with stiff chops and using the ring ropes and turnbuckles as weapons. It's not the kind of match you'd necessarily want or expect out of these two, but it's still dope as hell. There's also a great subtle story going on here that because Pillman only got subbed in due to Flair underestimating Eddie, Brian ALSO underestimates Eddie, which plays into/explains the use of really disrespectful wrestling tactics as opposed to going full tilt and trying to win with authority, and that plays into the major turning point of the match: after dumping Eddie to the floor, Brian gets cocky and thinks he's hurt Guerrero enough to take to the skies and hit a dive but OOPS! Eddie moves out of the way, Pillman lands chest first on the guard rail, and then to add further injury to injury, Eddie scores with a big dive of his own! It also plays into the finish, when Pillman gets up during an attempted Frog Splash and hits the top rope, crotching Eddie. Again, he thinks he's got Eddie beat here and goes for a Superplex, but nope, there's still fight left in Eddie's heart and soul! He punches Pillman off of the top turnbuckle, and lands the Frog Splash he was initially trying to score with to pick up the win. Definitely recommend you check this out if you get the chance, it's not the kind of match you'd expect out of these two, but it absolutely delivers on all fronts.

  
RESULTS: Guerrero def. Pillman via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Because this is apparently a 2018 episode of Raw, we get a video package recap of Savage getting his arm brutalized last week at the hands of Luger. I only note this because, to the best of my knowledge, this was done to cover for/explain a LEGIT injury Savage was working through/will be working through for the next while (a bicep tear if I'm not mistaken), and because this is a relevant storytelling point that I want you all to keep in mind when I'm reviewing World War 3 in two weeks time.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: BIG BUBBA VS ROAD WARRIOR HAWK

  
Apparently someone in the office thought that this show was taking place at the Omni or the Greensboro Coliseum, in 1987, because that's the only reason I can think of for deciding that Big Bubba and Hawk should be wrestling each other in 1995. On the plus side, this is worked closer to an old school JCP WCW match than what we've seen out of Hawk in his solo career here thus far (which usually look more like 1995 WWF matches, full of bad punches that set up additional bad punches, which set up even MORE bad punches), and while it's kept short (or maybe BECAUSE it's kept short), it's worked largely at a fast pace so it retains that sense of urgency that I think is arguably the most important thing to showcase in a wrestling match. Even once the pace starts to slow down while Bubba is working Hawk over, there's a lot of stiff striking going on which again conveys that urgency I look for. I may enjoy a good indierific spotfest as much as the next member of the IWC but sh\*t, nothing can replace the joy of watching tight, realistic work that gives the illusion of “I'm hurting my opponent for real” (without actually doing so) as well as “I'm trying to win a physical struggle” in my books. So yeah, this is a MUCH better match than I was anticipating, and I actually almost felt bad for my “someone thought this was 1987” joke until I got to the finish, which is a brilliantly ridiculous combination of “territory era wrestling tropes”, and “#LOLWhat?!?!?!?!” that is going to require a bit of explanation. So Bubba decides to reach into the 1980's Wrestling Heel Handbook and pull out a ROLL OF QUARTERS to use as a weapon. However, something we haven't been made aware of yet (thanks to this playing out on weekend syndicated shows and not Nitro) is that he and “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan are set to face off at World War 3, in a TAPED FIST MATCH! I wish I could find footage to show you, but there was even a vignette that featured Duggan learning that his family has a TAPED FIST FIGHTING BACKGROUND! I use all of this uppercase to showcase just how RIDICULOUS this all is! Anyhow, so Bubba is in a taped fist related feud so he does what any pro wrestler is obligated to do: tapes his coin wielding hand up to, I guess, give it Super Tape And Coin Punching Power? Anyhow, he runs to the rope to get a head of steam, but Duggan shows up out of nowhere, trips him up, causing Bubba to LAND FACE FIRST ON HIS OWN TAPED UP, ROLL OF COINS WIELDING HAND, AND KNOCK HIMSELF THE \*\*\*\* OUT! Man, I want to go on a rant about what kind of modern WWE Babyface d\*ckbag Hacksaw is for doing this, but I'm having a hard time thinking/saying anything beyond “BAHAHAHAHAHA! WHO BOOKED THIS SH\*T?!?!?!” I don't know whether to smack them for booking something so stupid, or give them an award!

  
RESULTS: Hawk def. Bubba via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

  
4: MAIN EVENT: STING VS HULK HOGAN (W/MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE)

  
AKA: “The Superbowl of Wrestling” if you're Bischoff. Or “A Preview Of The Match That Kickstarted The Death Of WCW At Starrcade '97” if you're The Intern. In a fun act of wrestling symbolism, Sting shows up wearing the Hogan red and yellow of old as his colors, which Heenan of course tries to put over as some kind of foul mockery. Meanwhile, Savage comes out in place of Hogan, and keeps pantomiming that OOOH YEAH, he's trying to get Hulk to come out. All of this is to distract Sting so that he doesn't notice Hogan (still wearing his Phantom of the Opera/Eyes Wide Shut orgy mask) VERY SLOWLY making his way out from the crowd in order to SNEAK UP ON STING LIKE HE'S A \*\*\*\*ING NINJA! As for the match itself, I don't know if I'd describe it as the Superbowl of Anything, but given the color of Hogan's skin, can we at least call it the Orange Bowl of Wrestling? Ahem... The beginning of this one was actually an AWESOME brawl, with Sting immediately firing up and taking Hogan to the woodshed, making the Hulkster actually look vulnerable as he pummels him from pillar to post. Spoiler alert (because it's going to be a couple of years before we get there), but this phase of the match plays out exactly like their Starrcade '97 match SHOULD have. Even after Hogan turns things around with an Irish Whip reversal and clothesline, he manages to pull out some of his better North American work here, actually punching and chopping with enough oomph behind his blows to make them look painful, rather than the usual phony look we're used to seeing. I don't even care about how limited his moveset has always been, if Hogan could have kept this kind of intensity and believability to his striking over the years, and this kind of willingness to make it look like his opponents could actually hurt him, I'd be lauding him as a damn good worker. He even takes a bump over the top ropes for a Sting dropkick, and while sure, he lands on his feet, HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE HIM DO THAT FOR ANYBODY? This match is making me put Hogan over as a solid and unselfish worker, WHAT IS EVEN HAPPENING?!?!?! We also see him break out a Gawddamn Suplex onto the floor, and sh\*t, that might be the biggest bump I've seen Hogan take OR cause someone to take! My favorite aspect of this match though is that it subverts the usual Hogan match tropes, and is more of a back and forth affair, between two men who are presented as equals. Well, okay, that might just be ONE of my favorites. My favorite thing might be watching Hogan pull from his Japanese work and whip out a \*\*\*\*ING CROSS ARMBAR! A better one than Rousey's working armbar at that! So yeah, this isn't an exciting modern classic (neither modern by 2018 standards, or even 1995 standards) holy sh\*t, this match is FANTASTIC, and might be my favorite Hogan match to not feature anyone named Inoki or Tenryu. And although yes, it's still a Hogan match so OF COURSE it's going to feature his bullsh\*t no selling, the way it was executed here was kinda brilliant, and leads to my NEW favorite moment of the match! So Sting does a little bit of leg work, and puts Hogan in the Scorpion Death Lock. Naturally, that sends Hogan into his No Selling Seizure of Rage, he powers out, Hulks Up, and hits the Big Boot, but actually sells leg damage and limps a bit before he can go for the Leg Drop. This brief moment of hesitation allows for Sting to get JUST enough of his wits back to dodge the Leg Drop, and cause Hogan to FURTHER hurt his leg (and yes, even with the appropriate level of selling). Sting locks in the Deathlock once more, and in the most brilliantly over the top Hulk moment possible, he basically starts WHINING AND CRYING to Savage about how Sting's breaking his leg, and BEGGING HIM FOR HELP! This might be the least Hulk Hogan moment in a match ever, and holy \*\*\*\*, I absolutely love it. If Hogan would have been willing to show this much ass more often in his nWo days, I might have enjoyed his matches of that era as much as I enjoyed his character work! And then because this is a WCW main event and we're not allowed to have nice things ever, The Dungeon Of Doom swarm the ring en masse and attack. WOMP WOMP! The important thing to note is that this time, they're also attacking Sting, thus proving that Hogan's talking point of “Brother, I bet you're DoD brother and I'm going to literally decapitate you dude!” was dead wrong. This actually becomes sorta important for World War 3, or at least it's mind boggling intro, as you'll see in a couple of weeks. Anyhow, this whole bit ends with Giant prepared to Chokeslam both Hogan and Sting at the same time, and Savage making the save with a chair. Giant only sells it for about 0.01 seconds and then grabs Savage for a Chokeslam, and Hogan proves to be the WORST FRIEND EVER, opting to go out of the ring to grab a chair instead of, you know, SAVING HIS \*\*\*\*ING FRIEND! Anyhow, he and Sting double chair-clothesline Giant over the top rope, and we end the segment with Giant trying to get back into the ring but being held back by Dungeon of Doom members because... reasons?

  
RESULTS: No Contest due to interference from the League Of Extraordinarily Lame Gentlemen  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-The show proper ends with Sullivan and Hart arguing with the commentary team and physically harassing Heenan, because... reasons?

&amp;#x200B;

  
PART 2 - WWF MONDAY NIGHT RAW 11/20/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Note: You know, as much crap as I give Vince as a commentator at time, he does a real stellar job before the opening of narrating a Survivor Series recap package. Specifically of Bret beating Diesel, and causing Big Daddy to lose his Cool. Vince recapping wrestling PPVs is something that would probably be pretty dope in 2018, just saying.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: HAKUSHI VS 1-2-3 KID (W/TED DIBIASE)

  
And just as quickly as I was to give Vince credit, I now have to take him to task for something: how the \*\*\*\* are you going to refer to Hakushi as the “modern day Kamikaze”? Even overlooking how racist as \*\*\*\* this is, I've seen him wrestle many matches, and not once have I seen him kill himself in order to take his opponent out. How is he an ANY era kamikaze?!?!?! Speaking of racist, Razor Ramon does a phone in interview during the match's open, and we get to hear Caucasian ass Scott Hall saying words like “McMang” and “the Stick Mang”! This is followed by Lawler making a “Taco Bell” joke about the “Cuban” Ramon, which is MULTIPLE levels of racial ignorance. Anyhow, wrestling racism aside, this is one of those matches that looks so much better on paper than it does in practice. On paper, we got a great kick loving high flier vs a dude who should be going full on puro (if they would let him), and that would be AMAZING! In practice, this is more of a storytelling affair, looking to get over Kid's new heel persona, and the first chunk of the match is wrestled during a phone interview, so how good do you think that's going to be? But yeah, it's a kicky punchy chinlocky deal, but don't worry, we also manage to add some screwy overbooking as Marty Jannnetty makes an attempted run in mid match! Luckily for Hakushi's odds of winning (which are criminally low anyway), officials manage to stop him from entering the ring and prevent him from going after Kid in some kind of Survivor Series revenge. We actually get to focus on the match a bit more post-commercial break but yeah, aside from some good kicks, there's not much to speak of here beyond one of the worst Frog Splashes I've ever seen. Like seriously, Kid goes up to the top, jumps, barely does the tuck in and out thing that makes a Frog Splash what it is, and then LANDS ON HIS FEET for a split second before “splashing” his opponent. So... More of a “Frog Jump, Land And Fall On My Opponent” than “Splash” I guess? #LOLWhat?!?!?! to that spot either way. Things pick up nicely with Hakushi's comeback spot, which includes a nice Flying Shoulderblock from the top, and his always awesome Handspring Back Elbow in the corner, but the effort is too little, too late, and he falls due to HEEL CHEATING! After sending Kid to the floor with a Thrust Kick, he goes up top to do a dive of some kind, but DiBiase sneaks over behind the ref's back and pats him on the ass, causing him to do a Senton to nothing. (Okay, Ted was PROBABLY pushing him off of the top ropes, I like my version better though!) Kid comes back in, and blasts Hakushi with the Spinning Heel Kick for the victory, much to Lawler's delight. I'm sure this isn't the first time that a Kid has made Lawler squeal “Yes! Yes! Yes!”, ahem.

  
RESULTS: Kid def. Hakushi via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, King interviews Kid, and he does something here that not enough wrestlers of EITHER alignment does anymore after a turn has been made: he acknowledges that in the past, he's said a lot of mean things about Kid, but now that a change of heart has been made, Lawler is proud of him. It's still a case of “I used to hate you until we both became the same alignment” with no reasoning behind it, but at least there's a little acknowledgment of the trope here. Jannetty come back out to confront Kid once more, but Sid makes the save, and the heels beat Marty down two on one, capping off with what would be a sick Powerbomb to the floor, if not for the fact that Sid apparently attended the “Kevin Nash School of Lazy Powerbombs Where You Just Let Your Opponent Gently Drift To The Floor Instead Of Spiking Them Down”.   


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Dok Hendrix' Slam Jam includes a promo from The British Bulldog, and I'll be damned if I know what he's saying! I kid, he actually puts over how he does have a high profile victory over Bret (that incredible Summerslam match at Wembley Stadium), and is confident that he can make lightning strike twice, so to speak. We also learn that next month's In Your House is going to feature... Sigh, I had hoped this match had already happened... The infamous Hog Pen Match between Helmsley and Godwin. And to think, this match was done BEFORE Hunter would get put in the dog house for the MSG Curtain Call!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: SKIP (W/SUNNY) VS SAVIO VEGA

  
If you want an example of how high Skip's stock with backstage officials must be, he doesn't even get an entrance, we just go straight from Slam Jam to he and Sunny being in the ring. I'm glad they don't do sh\*t like this in the modern era any... Oh... wait... As for the match itself, the nicest thing I can say about it is that man, I absolutely LOVE Vega's upbeat Caribbean theme song! Actually, the match isn't terrible by any means, it's just that there's nothing really notable about it besides how awesome that theme music is, and the fact that I think Chris Candido was born a decade or two too later. Seriously, watch his matches, watch what an incredible bumping heel he was, and try to tell me that he wouldn't be a better fit in late 70's/early 80's Memphis than he was mid 90's WWF. Now we see why he was such a big deal in Smokey Mountain, and was more of a big pile in the WWF I guess, dude was a territory era worker in the wrong damn time and place. Anyhow, because tonight's show is all about the overbooking (see the main event in a little bit), a Wandering Diesel shows up and uses Push Him To The Floor on Skip, it was Super Effective! No bell is rung for a disqualification or anything, instead we get Diesel taking to the mic to (somewhat angrily and/or facetiously) apologize for his actions after losing to Bret the night before, but SWERVE BRO! He ISN'T sorry bro! In fact, unlike what his friend would do in 1997, he found his smile when he woke up in the morning because now, he's the One, True, REAL Diesel, and not “that corporate puppet that YOU CREATED VINCE!” I could be wrong, but I think this might be one of the first (if not THE first) instances of someone hinting at outing Vince as the owner of the WWF on tv, though far from the last case of that happening. He also kinda precursors the real meat and potatoes of how both companies would handle the Monday Night Wars within a couple of years: he goes into a “The rest of the show is fake, but THIS PART IS REAL!” kinda tirade about how as soon as he won the championship, he didn't immediately become the smiling, happy, fan loving Diesel that we would know for the past year, but rather The Office MADE him do it. For MARKETTING REASONS! But that Diesel is NO MORE, and the REAL Diesel, the guy who BEATS PEOPLE UP and will only smack hands with the fans who WEAR THE BLACK GLOVES! Which... if I'm being honest... Kinda reeks of “FOR MARKETTING REASONS”, right? I mean, isn't this basically just a big setup to tell kids who love Nash that they better damn well get their parents to buy them black gloves so that he'll give them high fives maybe? Either way, this is one of those promos that have always stuck with me, and it's interesting to see such a “shades of gray” approach being taken with a character before Russo started writing. Here, he comes off as kind of a heel douche, but is also still cool with the fans who support him, and openly proclaims that he's still friends with HBK. I'm not in love with that whole “The rest of the show is fake, but THIS IS REAL!” vibe that promos like this tend to generate (because even though I I know none of the show is real, if you're TELLING me it's fake, then why the \*\*\*\* do I want to watch it?!?!?!), but still, I thought it was a fascinating attempt at creating a three dimensional character in 1995, and 23 years later, I still feel the same way.

  
RESULTS: No Contest due to Randomly Occurring Kevin Nash  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: MAIN EVENT: OWEN HART (W/JIM CORNETTE AND MR FUJI) VS SHAWN MICHAELS

  
What the \*\*\*\* is it with only one person per match getting full entrances tonight? I didn't mention it above but Hakushi started out in the ring, Skip started out in the ring, and now OWEN \*\*\*\*ING HART starts out in the ring. Meanwhile, HBK gets a full entrance so long that it LASTS THROUGH AN ENTIRE \*\*\*\*ING COMMERCIAL BREAK! INFURIATING! On the plus side, that's the last bad thing I'll have to say about this one, as now we get two of the best workers in the company/the world at the time getting a good 10 minutes or so in order to apply their craft. There's a little more “Owen getting his ass kicked and looking kinda like a goober” than I like to see in any Owen match, but sh\*t, when the action is this good, featuring two masters, I'm willing to overlook it. Besides, Owen gets a large chunk of the middle portion of the match to shine and work Shawn over, and while this is the slowest moving portion of the match, again, two masters at their crafts. These two can make a \*\*\*\*in extended chinlock segment look riveting. As much as I want to keep raving on about how great these two wrestlers are though, I do have to take a moment to make an aside, and highlight why I keep making Lawler pedophile jokes, even though those charges against him were dropped: in the middle of a masterclass of free tv wrestling, he puts over how actor Tony Randall is his hero for marrying a woman 50 years younger than him... Do you SEE why it's way too easy to make “LOL Jerry likes 'em young” jokes? Hell, once the late Brian Christopher shows up, even JR would dip into those kind of jokes himself! Anyhow, this is a dope match, but is even more notable for historical purposes. If you were watching the WWF in this era, or have at least watched clips, then you probably know what's coming up when I say “Owen avoids getting pulled out of the corner by the leg, by hitting a big Enzuigiri.” Shawn fights out of a Sharpshooter attempt, makes the comeback, clotheslines Owen out of the ring, does a dance... and then holds his head and collapses to the mat. Owen gets back into the ring but instead of going after Shawn, he confers with Cornette, like he's confused. The ref checks on him, we get medical personnel on hand to give him oxygen, even Vince leaves the announce table to check on him. This is honestly one of the most memorable wrestling moments of 1995 (if not of all time), something that's been etched into my memory since it happened, and although it boils down to being a SECOND instance of “The rest of the show is fake but THIS PART IS REAL!” on the show, it manages to do so without the “the rest of the show is fake” part. This didn't feel like a wrestler trying to make us feel like his segment is more real than anything else going on, this felt like an actual wrestling mishap. That things didn't necessarily go off script, but that someone “legit” got hurt, with a very realistic depiction of how that kind of situation might be handled if it WERE real. What shocks me most about this though is that both this and Diesel being all “You guys in the back wanted my character to be this way but now I'm the REAL ME AGAIN!” not only occurred on the same show (which I legit forgot about), but also that both happened before the Brian Pillman “I RESPECT YOU BOOKERMAN!” moment, which is largely considered by many to be the REAL start of this “The rest of the show is fake blah blah THIS IS REAL!” trend. Either way, yeah, whether this was a good finish or a bad finish, I'll leave for each of you to decide individually, but like I said, I know that it's stuck with me for 23 years now. And hey, it led to Owen “winning” his second Slammy award, so I'm pretty much going to call it awesome on that basis alone!

  
RESULTS: No Contest due to Randomly Occurring Wrestling History  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
TV RATINGS: Nitro def. Raw 2.8 to 2.5. I'm not really surprised to see the ratings this close to each other, because honestly, both shows were really good in different ways. If you enjoy actual wrestling, then you probably would have stayed tuned to Nitro, as aside from a lame ass opening match, that show not only gave us three really good matches, but each was a different KIND of good match. If it wasn't for the main event, Raw would have been an absolute wrestling wasteland, featuring two meh matches, and two matches that didn't even have finishes, but from a storytelling and historical importance standpoints, there were great moments on Raw that'll probably stick with most of us for 10 times as long as watching Eddie/Pillman or Hogan/Sting. Maybe even longer than the LOL-ness of watching Big Bubba lose by bumping his face on his hand! So yeah, at the end of the day, while I think that Nitro was the better show this week, Raw is the one that everyone was going to be talking about for days and weeks to come. And to me, that sounds like more of a victory than a 0.3 difference in ratings.  


  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK: You know how much love I have for Eddie Guerrero, and as much as I would ordinarily jump at the opportunity to give the nod to he and Pillman... Yeah, my love of Owen Hart matches is usually enough to trump any other wrestlers. ESPECIALLY when he's in there with someone of HBK's caliber. Even if you remove the extremely memorable finish, this was already better than anything else happening on either show, add the fact that the finish was one of those era defining moments and yeah, it's hard to top this folks.  


  
LOWLIGHT OF THE WEEK: As boring as I thought the two Raw squash matches were, at least they were wrestled by guys who were interested in following the rules of pro wrestling and seemed like they wanted to be there. Norton and Shark both just felt/looked like they wanted to get the match over with ASAP, they had no interest in storytelling, selling anything, or working for more than 2 minutes, and although it wasn't as boring as Raw stuff, for the above reasons, I dub them the real lowlight in my books.  


  
NEXT WEEK: It's WCW World War 3, the show that both opens and closes with Hulk Hogan at his most infuriating levels of Hoganness! Also, the WCW World title is up for grabs in the most HARD TO FOLLOW BATTLE ROYAL EVER! 60 men, 3 rings, it makes TNA's Reverse Battle Royal look like... No, that Reverse BR horsesh\*t is way worse than this thing, but still, it's pretty \*\*\*\*ing impossible to cover until the last 20 men get into one ring together! Get ready to gloss over like 80% of that one Soupies!

9pbpnc,1,2018-10-18,47[M4F] weekend with my daughter’s roommate,ClearlyALoon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9pbpnc/47m4f_weekend_with_my_daughters_roommate/,"I’ve posted this one before and have had fun with it. If you’re not up for long back and forth, but you just want to chat, that works too.

*****

I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa (but you can choose a different name, if you prefer). I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are.

Ideally this would go on for a bit. I like buildup.

Ideally I’d find a partner who wants to chat and role play beyond this scenario assuming there’s some chemistry.

Sometimes I have a lot of time, sometimes I can only write once a day. "

WCW WORLD WAR 3 11/25/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Fun show open note: wasn't 1995 a much more innocent time, where you could name a PPV something like “World War 3” or \*\*\*\*ing “Armageddon” and not have people freak out over the unstable global political climate? Good times!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-If you want an indication about how awesome and important this PPV is, consider this: the show opens with Hulk Hogan taking a festering pile of bright orange sh\*t over the past month of storytelling, as well as telling Dave Meltzer to go \*\*\*\* himself in the most PG ways possible! No, seriously, I'll even post video proof after I'm done ranting/going #LOLWhat?!?!?! over all of this! Hogan Black (but not Black and White) is out with Savage and Sting here, who he's now calling his two best friends, and he's officially ending the Darkside of Hogan storyline because... reasons? I'm guessing that the intended reason was “After the brothers in the Dungeon of Dudes attacked my brother Sting dude, I realized that dude, Sting isn't my foe brother, he's my brother dude!”, but no, no reason is mentioned. He just outright removed the black bandana and shirt, revealing that he's in red and yellow again underneath this extra layer of clothing, and drops them into a garbage can, which then ERUPTS INTO A PILLER OF FLAMES like it were Sodom or \*\*\*\*ing Gomorrah! He then verbally blows both of his sidekicks, claiming he'll never question Sting again (LOL remember that for next week's Nitro folks...), that Macho Man is his best friend (LOL remember that at the end of tonight), and that he wants to be their friend forever (LOL remember that at Bash At The Beach 1996). Then, Hogan breaks out a rolled up page from the Wrestling Observer, and claims that Macho's arm's not REALLY injured, they were just FAKING the injury to work the “rag sheets”! Is... is Hogan a smark now?!?!?! This also leads to him breaking out the best Hogan line ever: “The internet's got the scoops brother!” HAHAHAHAHA! Even if it wasn't for the fact that the internet has BECOME the poor man's dirt sheets, and yet dirt sheet writers can still get people to pay for their premium dirt sheet content, this would be an hilarious work of outsider art in promo form. Anyhow, forgive the sh\*t quality, as this is the only video footage I could find on YouTube.

1: TV TITLE MATCH: DIAMOND DALLAS PAGE (W/THE DIAMOND DOLL) VS JOHNNY B. BADD (C)

  
Oh man, I forgot the added stipulation to this one, and if you want to know just how progressive pro wrestling in America was when it comes to women, here we go: Kimberley decided that she's sick of DDP's obsession with Badd and the TV title, and she offers to PUT HERSELF ON THE LINE AS WELL! So it's not just a title match, it's a WINNER OWNS KIMBERLEY PAGE MATCH! Or owns her services anyway. If Russo were booking at this time, it would have been a Kimberly Page On A Pole Match. Or maybe a REVERSE Kimberley Page's Services match, where the LOSER gets to keep her. I don't know how pro wrestling OR Vince Russo works. All I do know is two things: (1) All of this storyline basically took place on WCW Saturday Night, and the WWE can't put this era of syndicated shows up on the Network fast enough; (2) Badd vs Page is always one of those matches that sounds terrible in my brain, because I forget that Badd is a highly underrated worker, and that Page was starting to get good in 1995, and then the matches usually wind up being way better than anticipated. So the real question is, now that I'm watching this with higher expectations than their past matches, how does this one stack up? Pretty damn good, as it turns out! In terms of the story laid out thus far, Page is running on extra desperation here, as he not only is hungry and obsessed with winning that TV title, he also wants to retain control of his... What IS Kimberley to him in kayfabe at this point? His possession? Valet? Valet who is also his possession? Either way, this translates to Page saying “\*\*\*\* this feeling out process that a normal match might have” and just going full HAM on Badd, wrestling the entire thing with a sense of intensity and urgency that isn't Chris Benoit level, but is also 10 times beyond what you'd expect from 1995 DDP. It's fantastic in that “guy working like he's trying to win a physical confrontation” way I keep bringing up in my SDL reviews, AND it absolutely fits the story being told here. Is it any wonder that Page became one of the most popular dudes in the company a couple of years later? And then the moment Badd starts to get any real offense going, and the action spills to the floor? Dude begs off like an old school Southern rasslin' heel, hides behind Kimberley, PUSHES her into Badd and starts sucker punching him! Man, who knew that 1995 DDP was ALSO super underrated?!?!?! Badd's selling and bumping was really on point here, and the fact that he spent so much of this one taking offense instead of dishing it out really helped ramp up the heat, and only served to make his proper babyface comeback get that much more of a reaction from the crowd. It's not a 7 star “Meltzer whacks off to this” workrate classic by any means, but this, my friends, is REALLY GOOD basic pro wrestling done well. I also want to take a second to give some love to one of my favorite spots in the whole match, which was a great false comeback moment: Page charged in to kick a downed Badd, but Johnny rolled out of the way. Not only did Page's kick whiff, but he sold it like he was Charlie Brown, and Badd was a football moved at the last second by Lucy, and fell right on his ass! Again, such basic pro wrestling but done so expertly! Not long after, Page channels his inner Curt Hennig, selling a kick to the chest by back bumping and flipping head over heels, and I continue to wonder why I never appreciated what a great bumping heel DDP was in this era. Badd winds up making the fired up comeback with some right and left punches, and drives the crowd into an EXCITED FRENZY when he calls for Kimberley to break out the sign, and she gives him a 10+ for the huge haymaker that finally dropped Page, that's pretty awesome! In the end, Badd is able to punch Page over the top rope (somewhere Bill Watts was watching this going “DISQUALIFICATION! ALSO WHY ARE THE LIGHTS ON? WHY ARE THERE MATS ON THE FLOOR? WHY ISN'T IT 1975 ANYMORE?”), land with his Bad Moon plancha, get Page back into the ring, and score the victory with a Slingshot Leg Drop. I've raved about this match enough, but in closing, I want to give a huge +1 to Kimberley for her acting here. After Badd got the win, the gravity of what happened hit her, and she just kinda stared slackjawed at the camera, a look that simultaneously conveyed shock and “oh \*\*\*\*, what did I get myself into?” on her face. I don't remember where this story goes beyond “JBB is a good, married Christian man who has issues being in a romance angle with another man's wife and goes to the WWF, which leads to an angle that leads to his eventual divorce, oops!”, but the way she milks it even as she gets into the ring (before finally hugging Badd and accepting it) creates just enough doubt in the mind of the observant viewer. The commentary team sadly doesn't pick up on this, but in my brain, it raises the question, did Kimberley really want to leave Page? Did she put herself on the line thinking it'd motivate him to appreciate her more, but also to win the title? Or was she really sick of Page, and that look of shock was her being shocked at finally getting her freedom? Great, understated storytelling there, all from a simple facial expression.

  
RESULTS: Badd def. Page via pinfall

  
MELTZER RATING: \*\*\* 1/2. So... Can we all take a moment, as a fanbase, and try our best to end the notion that Badd was a bad(d) worker, and that Page was terrible until like 1997? Because holy sh\*t, this was a fantastic match that got the crowd real into it, and got MY jaded ass into it also. Beyond that, I've been at this retro review thing for awhile now, and to the best of my recollection, I don't think I've reviewed a single bad Badd match. And the only meh DDP match I remember reviewing was him vs The Renegade, and even THAT was way better than expected. Plus Page was pretty great in it. So yeah, \*\*\*\* what the internet or Bruce Prichard or Tony Schiavone have said on podcasts, JBB was pretty dope, and DDP was good long before he gets credit for it.   


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, Mean Gene gets an interview with Badd and Kimberley, and JBB is pretty happy to show her how a REAL man respects a woman. To show that he's a respectful guy, he isn't forcing her into that valet stipulation deal, but rather he's letting her decide whether she wants to be his manager, or whether she wants to go his own way. That's pretty noble, could you imagine a WWE Babyface doing that? Nah, if this were, say, Cena, he'd probably just be like “Well Gene, I'm going to go \*\*\*\* the sh\*t out of another man's wife now, because he's a b\*tch fag p\*ssy who couldn't satisfy a woman! Because he has no balls!” And then he'd continue to antagonize Page for like 6 more months. We'd still be expected to cheer Cena and boo Page, because WWE morality only allows for two alignments: Chaotic Neutral if you're babyface, and Lawful Evil if you're a heel. Okay, third alignment: Chaotic Stupid if you're a Santino or R-Truth type.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: TAPED FIST MATCH: BIG BUBBA VS HACKSAW JIM DUGGAN

  
Allow me to give you my deep, intellectual, analytical overview of this match stipulation: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT?!?!?!?! It's basically just a normal match, but (1) both guys have their fists taped up; (2) the match can end in pinfall or knockout, but not submission, because when you want revenge on someone, you gotta hold them down for 3 seconds, and not put them in a move that's so painful they give up; (3) WHY IS THIS EVEN HAPPENING?!?!?! Anyhow, reember that thing I said about about WWF alignments? Well, Duggan is WCW now, but he's FORMER WWF, so naturally, he sneak attack sucker punches Bubba during his introduction, because why WOULDN'T he?!?!?! As we'll see over the next... \*checks notes\* \*\*\*\*, several YEARS of Duggan matches? WHO EMPLOYED HIM FOR THIS LONG?!?!?! Anyhow, as you'll see over time, Duggan is the most dirtbag cheater babyface in the promotion, so I guess this is to be expected. I don't remember when Jim Duggan: Dirty Cheater - The Character truly picks up, but you'll see what I mean when we get there. He does get bonus points with me though for coming out with his 2x4 strapped around his shoulder like Elias carrying a guitar or something, that popped me at least. He loses that good will immediately by trying to blast Bubba with the 2x4, which the ref stops, and shatters the entire illusion of this farce of a match by making me type a FOURTH numbered list entry about the match stipulation: (4) Why did the ref stop Dugan from using the 2x4? Additionally, why is this even specifically a Taped Fist match? The match stips say that hey, it can only end by pin or KO, so that 2x4 is legal, right? Which means this is just a No DQ match where the competitors happen to have their fists taped? I'm thinking WAY too much about this horsesh\*t. Anyhow, I'd make my usual joke (well, not joke as much as realistic observation) about this being a typical WWF style kicky punchy chinlocky affair, but this is all about the taped fists, so it's basically just a punchy punchy additional punchy deal. Blargh! The only real fun thing about this is that at least they use the three ring setup (for the main event sh\*tshow) to the fullest, taking the (in)action to the floor around all three rings, and inside each of the rings. That and Bubba breaks out a really beautiful enzuigiri (!!!) that might have put Duggan in an HBK style coma if Duggan had any brains in his skull. Bubba is responsible for another of the few match highlights as well: he apparently brought a roll of tape with him, and uses it to tape Duggan to the ropes! And apparently this is tape made from adamantium or something, because instead of just breaking it like a normal human being might, Duggan does nothing but get helplessly pummeled into near unconsciousness, which earns this match at LEAST +1 star rating for that alone! It takes the ref helping him escape for him to get undone, which only comes after a moment that I can't decide whether I love or hate: Bubba charges at Duggan, and he responds by STICKING HIS FIST UP so Bubba smashes face first into it. The finish is the hilarious stuff of legends: Duggan hits Bubba with his 3 Point Stance clothesline, but V.K. Wallstreet comes out with a chain wrapped around his fist, because reasons? Duggan goes for the 2x4 and blasts Wallstreet with it, which sends the chain flying into the win, Bubba wraps the chain around his fist and punches Duggan with it while the ref is busy removing Wallstreet from ringside, and yeah. A taped fist match ends with a chained fist. At least they paid off the whole “this match can end by KO” aspect, that's respectable, right?

  
RESULTS: Bubba def. Duggan via KO

  
MELTZER RATING: 1/2\*. (Worst Match of the Night) That seems fair to me. This was a TERRIBLE match, make no bones about it, but as per my usual crowd reaction rule, the fans were way too into this for me to be able to justify anyone giving it a negative star rating. Even if most of the crowd reaction was just them chanting “USA!” to cheer on the American guy. As he took on the other American guy. We wrestling fans... aren't that smart sometimes, are we?  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-It's more Mean Gene time as he interviews Ric WOO! By Gawd Flair about his upcoming grudge match against Sting. Flair screams a lot of stuff as you'd expect, and the fans love him, because at this point in his career, Flair may be a villain, and he may not be saying anything of substance, but he's still Ric \*\*\*\*ing Flair so he is beloved. By myself included.   


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: CUTIE SUZUKI AND MAYUMI OZAKI VS AKIRA HOKUTO AND BULL NAKANO (W/SONY ONOO)

  
Well... This PPV just got more interesting! Okay, so remember how at Survivor Series, the WWF pepped up their Alundra Blayze vs Wrestling Roseanne Barr feud by bringing a bunch of Joshi talent in to fill out their teams? Yeah, WCW one upped them here. Suzuki and Ozaki are both pretty high profile Joshi talents; Suzuki was on the tail end of her career here, as she'd retire 4 years later, but she was a big enough name to have had a Sega Mega Drive wrestling game made based on her in Japan, which is more than most wrestlers can say. Ozaki is 9 years into her wrestling career here, but she kept going after this, making appearances in Shimmer and Chikara as recently as 3 years ago. As for Hokuto and Nakano, you've probably seen me throw their names around a few times, and there's a good reason for that: the argument could be made that these were the two best women wrestlers of their era, if not of all time. At the very least, Nakano is my pick for best woman wrestler of all time, and is easily in my top 20 regardless of gender. Fans in the audience have no idea who any of these ladies are, so it'll be interesting to see how they react to an all foreign crew here. Those of us at home, however, have the benefit of Mike Tenay on guest commentary, who does a great job of explaining these women's histories, including how this is actual an interpromotional battle; Nakano and Hokuto work for All Japan Women, Suzuki and Ozaki work for JPW, so this is a match we wouldn't even see in Japan. How \*\*\*\*ing awesome is THAT?!?!?! And speaking of awesome, THIS MATCH! Although Onoo was out there with Hokuto and Nakano to establish them as heels, that actually wasn't a necessary step as the in ring storytelling dictates alignments pretty clearly by second 0.1 of the match, when the heels are rushing the babyfaces with real stiff looking strikes. By like 30 seconds in, the crowd is popping for big kicks, “OOOOOHing” for Nakano's sick hair pull toss (the same one that Nia Jax started using, where the woman she's throwing rotates like 400 degrees mid flight), and are already developing super sympathy for the faces. If you needed further proof of alignment, scope out Hokuto dragging Ozaki to her own corner, letting her almost reach for the tag, then locking in the abdominal stretch while taunting Suzuki. And to add more insult to injury, she gets cocky enough to keep shoving one of Ozaki's arms closer to her corner, only to pull it back into the hold at the last second. HOW \*\*\*\*ING DOPE IS THAT?!?!?! This is high level physical storytelling, good Soupies! And once Suzuki finally makes the hot tag, and we get one of the storytelling high points of the match - both faces locking the heels into simultaneous half crabs - the crowd LOSES THEIR MINDS! For, may I remind you, women who are foreign to them in more ways to one. While I don't know how ready mainstream American wrestling fans are for a Japanese main event just yet, this is proof that at the very least, you can make them give enough sh\*ts to invest in them as performers if you play to their strengths (physical storytelling) and don't make them try to cut mainstream American wrestling promos. The finishing stretch of this match was legendary as well, with the kind of rush of high spots you'd expect from a ood puro story. Nakano powerbombs Suzuki, but whiffs a moonsault. The faces retaliate by hitting FOUR Coup De Gras on her (two from each face). This not only isn't enough to get the win, but Nakano is able to reverse a double suplex attempt from the two and suplexes them both at once! Hokuto Flying Cross Body Blocking both faces at once! Simultaneous ranas from both faces for the nearfall! So much fun sh\*t going on at the end of what was already an exciting match! In the end, Nakano crushes Ozaki with a big Alabama Jam to pick up the win for the heels, and wow, good luck topping this, everyone else!

  
RESULTS: Hokuto and Nakano def. Suzuki and Ozaki via pinfall (Nakano pinned Ozaki)

  
MELTZER RATING: \*\*\*\* (Match of the Night) What? Meltzer giving a high rating to purely puro match? SAY IT AIN'T SO! Seriously, these women earned every bit of the praise this match gets, and if you watch anything on this show, I'd say watch this \*\*\*\*ing match. It's the kind of match we'd be losing our sh\*t over if it happened in 2018, yet was happening in 19-Gawddamn-95!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Mean Gene returns, this time to plug the hotline, and to interview Jimmy Hart and Lex Luger, the latter of whom will be facing Luger and his not really injured arm - again, remember that plot point. Luger manages to put over his match as well as the main event battle royal without sounding like he's having a stroke mid sentence, so I call it a win.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: US TITLE MATCH: CHRIS BENOIT VS KENSUKE SASAKI (W/SONNY ONOO)(C)

  
SURPRISE! Did you know Sasaki was US champion? Because I sure as \*\*\*\* didn't! I love the timing of this one actually, as Sasaki's wife (Hokuto) had just wrestled the last match, so there's a little fun family continuity for you. And as you'd expect, he comes out with both Onoo and stereotypical “ching chong chong ching” music so we fans know we're supposed to boo him. As for him being champion, he apparently beat Sting in a match in Japan, which means that Meltzer probably gave the title change at least \*\*\*\*1/2. At least. We saw these two have a really good, albeit short match on Nitro a while back, and I had wondered what a longer version of that match would look like. And hey, I get my wish here, as they get around 10 minutes to work with this time! The pacing is a bit slower (which makes sense), but the intensity and urgency is dialed up to 11 as these two just Strong Style the p\*ss, sh\*t, and other bodily functions out of each other. The slower pace (and emphasis on mat wrestling during the middle portion) means this winds up being the least exciting match of the night thus far, but don't think that it's boring, the work is so good that while the in house audience largely doesn't give a \*\*\*\* the match during the lulls in actions, they stay awake enough to pop for the actual exciting things. One minor nitpick though: I could have lived with NOT seeing Benoit blow through Sasaki with a suicide dive and basically collide head \*\*\*\*ing first into the guard rail... I'm just going to breathe through my teeth for a few minutes until the future brain damaged murderer leaves my tv screen, okay? Him hitting the Diving Headbutt and selling it with agony is enough to make me kinda want to put the dogs in the poolhouse and just fast forward right to the finish. Oh... \*\*\*\*... The finish ALSO ends on a retroactively concerning note, with Sasaki no selling a Lariat, hitting a big one of his own, and then planting Benoit skull first (SIGH) into the mat with a Northern Lights Bomb. I bet this match was a lot easier to enjoy in 1995 than it was in 2018...

  
RESULTS: Sasaki def. Benoit via pinfall

  
MELTZER RATING: \*\*\*1/4. It feels weird saying that a Benoit match wasn't the best or most exciting thing on the card (at least in an era before Mysterio would show up), but yeah, I feel like this was structured more to be a cool down match than anything else. Don't get me wrong, it was the most intense, hardest hitting kind of cool down match possible, but Meltzer rating it higher than a lot of the card, but lower than the last two matches we saw is absolutely on point.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-If Mean Gene is getting paid by appearance here, he'd be making a mint tonight! Anyhow, now he gets to interview Kevin Sullivan and The Giant (whom Meltzer was saying was going to win the main event tonight, which I GUESS was the reason for Hogan's weird “Brother, Macho's arm isn't hurt dude!” rant), and not much is said beyond “The Dungeon are going to make sure Giant is going to win the battle royal! But if someone else in the Dungeon does win it, that's awesome as well!” Also, Giant goes to #LOLWhat?!?!?! territory with a poem: Roses are red, violets are blue, Hogan, I'm going to kick your butt from here to Kalamazoo! LOL What?!?!?!?!?!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-This is followed up with Savage getting a pre-match interview with Gene, and apparently “What is IS is what is is!!!” Okay then! Also, we learn that not only is he always jittery, that's part of his charm (?!?!?!), and he's going to beat Luger. Oh, and his arm isn't just 100% (REMEMBER THIS), it's ONE MILLION PERCENT. And that's HIGHER than 100%! Macho Man was so weird, and I love him for it.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: “MACHO MAN” RANDY SAVAGE VS LEX LUGER (W/JIMMY HART)

  
You know, for a guy who's arm is “at one million percent”, and “his injury was a work to swerve Meltzer”, Savage's arm sure is taped up here... The real story is that, if I'm not mistaken, he was actually working through a torn bicep here, which is both insane, AND means that Hogan's claim of 'working the sheets” was actually “working the marks”. Or Hogan just being full of sh\*t again, either or. Either way, yeah, this is very much your average 1995 WCW Macho Man match, which means it's better than Duggan/Bubba, but basically worse than everything else. Though on the plus side, it's better than the usual formula of “Macho gets his ass kicked then wins with two moves”! Here, Savage just beats the sh\*t out of Luger for several minutes, and picks up the visual win after hitting the Big Elbow, but - and stop me if you've heard this one before - the ref isn't there to make the count because he's distracted by Hart getting up on the apron hopping up and down. I KNOW! I'M SURPRISED TOO! It's not until the end of the match where Luger is able to string more than 0 moves of his own together: throwing Savage into the aprons of one of the other rings, and then Torture Racking him on the floor while Hart distracts the ref, because... reasons! And now to pay off the teaser I've been posting throughout this review: remember how I made sure to remind you all of the not injured, at “one million percent” arm of Savage? Luger gets the win by grabbing that not injured, at “one million percent” arm, locking in a basic key lock, AND PICKING UP THE SUBMISSION VICTORY! Reason 1000000 out of Infinity why you should not believe a \*\*\*\*ing thing Hulk Hogan says.

  
RESULTS: Luger def. Savage via submission

  
MELTZER RATING: \*1/4. I might have even gone as low as \* if I were the star ratings kinda guy, this match was a whole lot of nothing unless you like seeing Savage control a match with bad 80's WWF offense and then losing after three moves. Two of which targeted the back, the last one focusing on an arm that is injured but also not injured at all and SUCK IT MELTZER, YOU FELL FOR OUR RUSE! THE INTERNET'S GOT THE SCOOPS BROTHER!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, Luger refuses to let go of the Keylock, and Sting runs out to talk Luger into relinquishing the hold, which he does. It's an AWESOME callback to a few weeks back, when Luger got Sting to break a Scorpion Death Lock on Flair, and this is all leading to an incredibly layered, nuanced storyline for early 1996 that sadly gets nerfed once the nWo show up in May. That story also leads to a run of 2 or 3 months where Luger becomes the BEST WRESTLING CHARACTER in the company, which ALSO sadly gets nerfed when the nWo show up, and I can't wait to get there!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
5) RIC FLAIR VS STING

  
This is the first of two matches in a row (the last two on the card, incidentally), where I'm left wondering how the hell I'm going to review it properly, both for different reasons. The reasons why the main event is going to be impossible to review, I'll get into when we get there because holy \*\*\*\*, it's impossible to WATCH that, let alone review it. As for this one, I feel like I've already watched and reviewed at least half a dozen matches involving these two, so unless something happens that makes it stand out, what the \*\*\*\* do I even say? Every Sting/Flair match is basically the exact same: (1) Sting press slams Flair like 4 million times; (2) they rule and you should watch every single one of them. This one does have a fun wrinkle to it compared to their usual battles: because of the unique 3 ring setup for tonight's main event, Flair gets to be an incredible chickensh\*t heel here, fleeing from one ring to the other so he can create separation (\*\*\*\* YOU WWE FOR MAKING ME HATE THOSE WORDS), and recuperate by Fargo Strutting to taunt Sting into following him. It doesn't really add much to the match beyond crazy fun house show antics, but those are the best anyway, so I love it. Also, on a less important (but WAY MORE ANNOYING) note, Colonel Parker and Sistah Sherri come out randomly to watch the match, and make out a bit on the entrance ramp, so of course our camera man has to focus on them for a small bit instead of, you know, showing us the \*\*\*\*ing match. If this had any kind of payoff, I might be able to justify it, but... hahaha, yeah... But overall, the match itself tells a great story: Sting is so fired up with murderous rage that he basically just trounces Flair for most of it, and this provides a realistic reason for Sting to no sell a lot of Flair's offense: he's basically in a massive berserker rage and Flair isn't hitting him hard enough to snap him out of that. It takes Sting whiffing a Stinger Splash on the floor, and hitting the guard rail with his ribs for him to start showing any vulnerability and allow Flair to take control of the action. As much as I sh\*t on Hogan for his no selling, the truth is that I have NO problems with a good no sell if the story being told in ring gives it context, and a reason for being able to realistically happen. Things like “it's an adrenaline rush, and he's temporarily able to shrug off pain”, or “he's in a frenzy and feels no pain” work. Things like “Well, you hit me with your finisher, now I'm at 100% HP and have negated the entire match in the process” is horrible, phony, and makes ME want to go into a no selling frenzy of rage. Here's another example of proper context for a no sell in this match: Flair gets Sting beaten down to the point where he could lock on the Figure Four. It seems to be doing damage, but Flair makes the mistake of taunting Sting by slapping him in the face. This reignites the rage within Sting, who goes into no sell mode and reverses the hold, and even the announcers are able to pick up on this and point it out, so a huge +1 to them for doing so. In the end, Sting's able to pick up the win with a real 1-2 combination kill shot: a Superplex, followed up by the Scorpion Death Lock. Flair is unable to find the key to the Lock or escape Scorpion Death, so he surrenders, thus ending yet another great match in their series of great matches.

  
RESULTS: Sting def. Flair via submission

  
MELTZER RATING: \*\*\*3/4. Sounds about right to me. I'm pretty sure that you can just default Flair/Sting matches at a \*\*\*1/2, because I'm sure they could sleepwalk their way to that rating.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Because we didn't see enough Hogan on the show with his weird rant at the top, Gene is here with Hogan again. Yay? I'm 99% sure that the entire purpose of this interview was to allow Hogan to make another “Big Stinky Giant” comment, as well as say “Fee Fi Fo Fum.” And also to declare that while Sting and Savage are his bestest friends in the whole world, he will destroy them if they're the last three. I'm going to actually okay this sentiment because it's every man for himself, this is the proper mindset for this kind of match.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
6: MAIN EVENT - WORLD WAR 3 BATTLE ROYAL

  
Ugh... So yeah, this is going to be literally impossible to \*\*\*\*ing review. I don't do deep breakdowns of Battle Royals in general anyway, because they're too hectic to have much of any storytelling anyway. Now take the usual 20 man BR format, add two rings with 20 other wrestlers in each, and then have production display the action in small picture in picture in picture windows until we get down to the last 20 people... Oh, and with THREE ANNOUNCE TEAMS calling the action... How am I supposed to review that? \*\*\*\*, how am I supposed to WATCH that! So in the interest of my own sanity, I'm just going to break down the competitors, and skip ahead to the final 6, because that's really when anything important actually happens. Reminder: this is for the WCW World title, so way to make your top title be decided in an unwatchable mess. Even more unwatchable than your average Hogan match.

&amp;#x200B;

  
\-YOUR MATCH PARTICIPANTS: Alex Wright, Arn Anderson, Big Bubba, Big Train Bart (better known as Black Bart. Well, better known by wrestling fans in the 80's, probably), Bobby Eaton, “Hard Work” Bobby Walker (Oh \*\*\*\*, I can't WAIT to talk about this guy when he shows up on an episode of Nitro and I have more time and space to discuss him), Booker T, Brian Knobbs, Brian Pillman, Buddy Lee Parker, Bunkhouse Buck, Chris Benoit, Chris Kanyon (!!!!!!), Cobra, Dave Sullivan, DDP, Dick Slater, Disco Inferno, Eddie Guerrero, Fidel Sierra (The Cuban Assassin, but not the one from Stampede, the other one), Hugh Morris, Hulk Hogan, James Earl Wright (basically just a guy who jobbed in the WWF and WCW), Jerry Sags, Jim Duggan, Joey Maggs (another journeyman who was kind of an undercard thing in Smokey Mountain, but mostly a jobber), Johnny B. Badd, Kensuke Sasaki, Kevin Sullivan, Kurasawa, Lex Luger, Lord Steven Regal, Marcus Bagwell, Mark Starr (a jobber who's last name was a lie), Maxx Muscle, Meng, Mike Winner (a jobber who's last name was ALSO a lie), Mr JL, One Man Gang, Paul Orndorff, Pez Whatley (a midcard guy from the 80's who used to team with Jimmy Valiant), Ric Flair, Ricky Santana (another job guy), Hawk, Scott Armstrong (Road Dogg's brother), Scott Norton, Scotty Riggs, Craig Pittman, The Shark, David Taylor, Steve Armstrong (ANOTHER one of Bullet Bob's kids), Stevie Ray, Sting, Super Assassins #1 and #2 (believe it or not, WARLORD and BARBARIAN as generic masked guys), The Giant, The Yeti (dressed as a GIANT NINJA, because #LOLWhat?!?!?!), VK Wallstreet, Zodiac.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Well, so much for my understanding of the rules... Apparently they went to just one ring with like 31 people left. Also, people keep going under the ropes all of the time so it's impossible to tell who's been eliminated... WHO THE \*\*\*\* THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?!?!?! I WAS going to try to recap this once we got down to just one ring but \*\*\*\* that, I'm going with my original idea of waiting until the final 6, and the only memorable sh\*t to happen.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-The final 6 are largely who you think it would be - Sting, Hogan, Giant, Savage, and Luger - and then for some reason One Man Gang as well? Because we had to keep OMG in there, but eliminate Flair and Arn almost simultaneously before we hit this final stretch? OKAY THEN, SURE! Anyhow, Hogan and Savage both work to try to eliminate OMG, meanwhile Luger and Sting team up to take out Giant. Hogan sees this, ABANDONS the attempt to take out the former African Dream, and helps his best friend in the whole world Sting take out the big, stinky, nasty, wart infested Giant. Hahaha, I'm just kidding, he takes out ALL THREE GUYS BY HIMSELF, because OF COURSE Hogan is &gt; the other big WCW guys! Giant pulls Hogan under the bottom rope, which the ref doesn't see (and there are no refs outside like at a Royal Rumble), because reasons. Meanwhile, Savage eliminates OMG off camera (because it was more important to focus on Hogan beating up Giant), the ref sees that Hogan is outside and thinks he's eliminated, and just like that, Savage is the WCW Champion via REFEREE BLUNDER!

&amp;#x200B;

  
RESULTS: Savage wins the Battle Royal. Those of us who watched this sh\*t heap were the real losers.

  
MELTZER RATING: \*. That seems WAY too generous for what we got. I would have given it a (DUD) at best, because of how utterly impossible to watch it wound up being. I can't imagine it was much easier to follow the madness live either. Just WOOF!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, as soon as Hogan hears that his Best Friend In The Whole World, Savage, has one the title, he pops me by yelling “WHAT?!?!?!” (if only he would have LOL's first...), and immediately throws a temper tantrum to explain that no, he WASN'T eliminated. He's not wrong, but holy \*\*\*\*, he just looks like the biggest baby in the world here, trying to get the fans to jump on his side, and basically throwing his BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WORLD under the bus, sh\*tting on his title reign like 0.5 seconds into it! Holy sh\*t! Remember folks, fair play, good sportsmanship, and respecting “the refs word is final” are not traits of a babyface hero. Wait, they're supposed to be? Oops... The best part is that Hogan keeps getting into Savage's face like this was HIS \*\*\*\*ing fault. WHAT THE \*\*\*\* DID SAVAGE DO BESIDES THROW ONE MAN GANG OUT, YOU \*\*\*\*ING ORANGE \*\*\*\*ING PIECE OF SH\*T?!?!?!  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
PPV BUYRATE: 0.43. Well, that's down from 0.6 at the last PPV. It's a shame too, as this was largely a pretty damn good show. Okay, about half of it was utter crap, but the other half was top shelf and made up for it in my opinion.  


  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: Not to go full Meltzer here, but the Japanese ladies take this in a heartbeat. I love that WCW didn't just import these Joshi stars and have them work a homogenized style like the WWE has been known to do, they had the balls to bring them in and be like “Hey, light the crowd up with a full on Joshi syle match”, and light the crowd up they did.  


  
LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: Meltzer scored the Taped Fist Match as lowest, but I'm actually giving that nod to the main event Battle Royal itself. Don't get me wrong, Duggan/Bubba SUCKED a whole bag of d\*cks, but at least it was coherent, and was possible to follow along with. Trying to follow along with the main event was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Wait, that's not nearly caustic enough to describe the experience. It was like trying to find a needle in a \*\*\*\*ing mosh pit.  


  
NEXT WEEK: The ongoing story of “STING YOU ARE \*\*\*\*ING STUPID!” continues, as he teams up with the Dungeon of Doom's Lex Luger to take on Brian Pillman and Arn Anderson. And Hogan keeps his promise to never question Sting ever again. One of those is true! Over on Raw, Bret Hart guest stars on Something To Wrestle, With Bruce Prichard! Wait, no, that's just The Brother Love show. Plus Undertaker is set to take on Kama Mustafa. Can you tell why I was a WCW guy for so much of my life?

I'm currently doing my undergrad, but as part of my program requirements, I need to complete a year long internship at a company. For some background info, I'm a computer science and economics major, so I've primarily been looking at internships within software development and fintech. I've been fortunate enough to do a few interviews but my experience so far has been more negative than positive. 

Most of my interviews are split between behavioural with the team manager and then technical/cultural fit sort of interview with usually 2-3 team members I'd potentially be working with. My behavioural interviews usually go well but every time I do my technical/cultural fit one I feel so... out of place. I feel like I'm never taken seriously for these 2nd interviews and at one point, I had a guy walk in and smirk at me and another pretty much dismiss me. Part of me thinks it's because I'm a small very young looking woman since all my interviews have been with 20-early 30 y/o men. I'm not sure if I'm overanalyzing it but I'm pretty bummed out and am honestly thinking of changing my career path... is anyone here in a male-dominated field? how do you cope with these type of feelings/what keeps you motivated and does it get better?"

PART 1 -WCW MONDAY NITRO 11/27/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-What a way to open the show this week: with World War 3 footage of Hogan burning the black, returning to the red and yellow, and having his real time love fest with Savage and Sting, his “two best friends in the whole world dude brothers” or whatever. We've already seen him throw Savage under the bus since then, is Sting next? STAY TUNED TO FIND OUT!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: TV TITLE MATCH: JOHNNY B. BADD (W/KIMBERLEY) (C) VS DIAMOND DALLAS PAGE

  
Okay, so you know that thing the WWE love to do where they'll air a PPV on Sunday, and then the next Monday and Tuesday, we get rematches no one asked for on free tv? Tonight's episode of Nitro is 50% WW3 REMATCHES, and this is the first of them! And to make it even more like modern WWE, this is a TITLE REMATCH! I almost typed “mandatory title rematch”, but WCW doesn't cling to that card as strongly as modern WWE does, plus I remembered that DDP was champion going into the PPV and retained. The only thing he won was the services of another man's wife. And yes, I AM upset that it wasn't a Kimberley On A Pole match. Hell, I would have donated my own pole to put her on! Ahem... DDP is in full on reconciliation mode, bringing flowers for Kimberley, but then uses this act as a chance to SUCKER PUNCH Badd! Man, 1995 Page continues to be 10 times better at his job than anyone even remembers. Unfortunately, this match winds up being terrible compared to the PPV barnburner they had, and it's not even the fault of anyone involved, because the work they do is strong. It's just seriously bogged down by two major things: (1) they only got a fraction of the time they did on PPV, which makes sense, but I'm talking a pretty LOW fraction, like 1/3rd of the time at most; (2) The camera spends more time focused on Gawddamn Kimberley than it does the match itself. I mean, I can't blame the cameraman for scoping her out like that, but... you know, I kinda like my wrestling to NOT be happening in the margins, you know? Still, this is somewhat necessary for the only real story being told here, which is that DDP didn't just bring flowers to try to win his wife back, but rather because he brought her a CHAIN to use, for CHEATING! The worst thing is, it turns out that she's a TRIFFLING CHEATER who was going to help DDP win but then tries to act like she wasn't! Seriously, while the ref is distracted by checking on Badd for no raisin, Page blatantly yells “THROW ME THE CHAIN! THE CHAIN FOR HITTING HIM IN THE FACE WITH!” (not verbatin), and KIMBERLEY DOES THAT! Except she is apparently weak, and the chain goes between Page's legs, honorable Good Guy Badd (there's an ironic sentence) grabs them, blasts Page in the face with them, and shoves them down his tights before making the cover, and Tom Phillips yells something about how “Turnaround is fair play, this is GREAT!” Wait, sorry, wrong Intern review show... Mongo basically utters whatever brain damaged hillbilly colloquialism best resembles that terrible thought of “The bad guy was about to cheat, so THE GOOD GUY CAN CHEAT RIGHT BACK!” Badd remembers that he's the good guy here AFTER the match and rightfully asks her “Why the \*\*\*\* did you throw a CHAIN into the match?”, and Kimberley's response of “Well... the important thing is, you WON!” makes me think that they could have pulled off a fun, complex “former heel turned honorable good guy deals with his former heel who might still be a heel new valet” storyline had Badd, you know, stayed with the company and not gone to New York shortly after this. Either way, I'd make a “Well, I guess we've already found our Lowlight of the Week” joke based on how disappointing this was, but there's still a Hogan match left on the card so yeah, this is probably NOWHERE near the worst thing we'll see tonight.

  
RESULTS: Badd def. DDP via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Mean Gene is on hand with Sullivan and Jimmy Hart to discuss... Well, I don't know what, because Sullivan basically just decides to b\*tch Hart out for the way he's handling Luger. Namely, he's upset that Luger is teaming with Sting tonight, AND that Luger didn't keep the armbar locked in on Savage's not at all injured, perfectly fine arm long enough to take him out of the main event. Hart brings up a surprisingly reasonable point - that Luger and Sting are still long time friends, so even though they have different goals and affiliation, they don't immediately hate each other - and then tries to reassure him that he's got plans to basically chip away at Sting, presumably to turn him evil. I'm legit surprised that Hogan didn't immediately appear to throw Sting under the bus and start questioning his motives. As I've mentioned before, this is actually a slow burn setup to what was briefly a really fun face and heel tag team storyline that also morphs Luger into one of the best wrestling characters of 1996, and it's kinda sad that the nWo ruined both of those from really reaching their end point in an organic manner.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: CUTIE SUZUKI AND MAYAMI OZAKI VS BULL NAKANO AND AKIRA HOKUTO (W/SONNY ONOO)

  
And our second of two “PPV rematches that are not as good as the original” bouts of the night. Unlike the opener, this one is actually really \*\*\*\*ing good, it's just an entirely lesser version of what we saw on PPV. Less match time, no Mike Tenay to explain who these women are, what they're history is, etc. But hey, we got Bischoff on hand to call things like “FRONT LEG FRONT KICK”, so... yay? One of the things I do love about this one (aside from the obvious “JOSHI WRESTLING ON AMERICAN TV” talking point) is that even though it's the followup to a PPV outing that not everyone watching Nitro might have seen, the women still worked in callbacks to their last match. The big one being how they played off of Nakano winning for the heel team on Sunday by squashing Ozaki (I think) with a Flying Guillotine Leg Drop. Here, she looks to finish with the same move again, this time against Suzuki, but the faces had seen/felt the move and knew it was coming, and Cutie was able to escape it and prevent history from repeating itself. I love the little details like that which make pro wrestling feel all the more real. We also get a fun callback to the faces hitting a series of Double Foot Stomps, this time in the form of both women jumping together for a SIMULTANEOUS Double Foot Stomp! A Quadruple Foot Stomp? However, much like Sunday, the heels were destined to win once again, as Nakano was able to wipe both faces out with a Double Lariat, Hokuto wipes them out with a Double Missile Dropkick, and then drives Suzuki to the mat with a Fisherman Buster (called by Bischoff as “OHHHH RIGHT ON HER HEAD!!!!!!”).

  
RESULTS: Nakano and Hokuto def. Suzuki and Ozaki (Nakano pinned Suzuki)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: HUGH MORRIS VS HULK HOGAN

  
Hugh Morris is THE LAUGHING MAN, and his name sounds like HUMOROUS! DO YOU GET IT?!?!?! He's also former NXT trainer Bill DeMott, who you might know as “that guy who resigned after many many many FCW, DSW and NXT trainees (including the man we know as EC3!) accused him of physical and mental abuse, as well as throwing around homophobic and racist slurs.” In other words, if those claims ring true, he's a real human piece of sh\*t. Of course, if you were watching WCW at this time, then the real question on your mind is probably “How did this sh\*theap even GET a job training anyone?” Seriously, how is anyone supposed to learn how to become a Superstar from a guy who was terrible in the ring, his character was “laughs a lot, and that's all”, and the highlight of his career was “his name became a d\*ck joke”?!?!?! The TL:DR version of this is \*\*\*\* Hugh Morris. I'd rather be watching Hogan wrestling Judy Bagwell than this chump! Another way to highlight how bad Morris is: HOGAN was outshining him in the ring, actually doing some light chain wrestling, and somehow throwing more believable looking working punches despite Hogan's working punches looking like they wouldn't break an egg. Anyhow, if you've seen any Hogan match ever, you know how this goes: Hogan takes a little bit of damage, then gets hit with his opponent's finisher - in this case, I put “hit” in quotation marks, because Morris couldn't even land his sh\*tty moonsault, the No Laughing Matter - which causes Hulk to go into the No Sell Seizure Of Doom. And this time it made sense, because Morris basically made almost no contact with him, so there was nothing to sell! Hugh Morris, YOU ARE MAKING ME TAKE HOGAN'S SIDE IN A MATCH, STOP! But yeah, Big Boot, Big Leg Drop, yadda yadda yadda. Morris is such an important cog in the DoD wheel that he didn't even have a a manager come out with him, and none of the Dungeon run out for a post-match attack, even though that's been their MO since Nitro started.

  
RESULTS: Hogan def. Morris via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Mean Gene is back, this time to talk with Hulk Hogan's Best Friend In The Whole World (and also WCW World champion, that might be important), Randy Savage. Gene wastes no time in throwing Savage under the bus for the controversial finish to that sh\*tty battle royal, which brings HOGAN out to get SUPER CONFRONTATIONAL with his best friend! Like seriously, why the \*\*\*\* is this d\*ckbag so mad at Savage? And not, say, the referee? Or WCW's championship committee? What, is Savage supposed to be like “Well Hogan, you're my bestest friend, so I don't want this title, you have it!” \*\*\*\* off, because there's no way Hogan would have done that if the roles were reversed! WCW Hogan is literally the worst human being alive, is the point I'm getting at here. Hogan calls for footage of the finish to be aired for Savage, but right before we get to see Hogan getting pulled out, the video GOES TO STATIC! You see, not only was Hogan the biggest victim in the world on Sunday, he's ALSO the biggest victim in the world TONIGHT as well! And then in a moment that made me LOL a bunch, Giant just casually walks up behind both men, axe handles Hogan, and Chokeslams Savage, hahaha! These overly argumentative chumps kinda sorta extremely deserve it. But it's not over, because not only does Hogan have to be the most screwed over person in the room, he ALSO has to be the biggest, toughest and strongest as well! Giant brings Hogan into the ring, because reasons, Sting comes out to make the save but fails at doing so, and Hogan has to save HIM by attacking Giant with the world's second weakest looking chairshots ever! I say second worst because the ACTUAL worst is when he just gentle presses a chair against someone's head, rubs it forward, and they DIE! The ref tries to calm Hulk down, but Hogan GENTLE ELBOWS HIM IN THE CHEST! I've asked this before, I'll ask it again: WHY DID ANY OF US CHEER THIS D\*CKBAG?!?!?! Anyhow, Hogan continues to chase Giant down, this time breaking out those Worst Chairshots In The World, and finally, Hogan and Sting check on Savage, who is STILL DEAD through all of this. Wow. \*\*\*\*ing wow.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: MAIN EVENT: ARN ANDERSON AND BRIAN PILLMAN VS STING AND LEX LUGER

  
This one starts out as a “BUT CAN THEY CO-EXIST” thing of a different type: instead of asking if they can co-exist, the commentary team question whether Luger's even going to show up, as the two didn't come out together, and Luger was late to the party. But he did show up, and all's well that ends well I guess. Anyhow, this match plays out like you'd think it would, with the faces (or face + heel I guess?) getting in short bursts of explosive power offense, and the heels bumping their ass to make them look like a million bucks, only this has the added wrinkle of “IS LUGER DOING HEEL THINGS OR IS THAT A MISTAKE?!?!?!?!” Case in point: Sting gets Arn locked into the Scorpion Deathlock midway through the match, Pillman goes up top to do a Flying Something, Luger goes to push Pillman off of the top ropes but OOPS! He accidentally sends Brian Flyin' (see what I did there?) right into Sting! Luger also misses out on taking a hot tag because he was busy fighting Pillman on the floor, and it's all minor story touches that don't have any real bearing on the finish but it's actually pretty awesome.  The finish comes out of nowhere, with Sting pinning Pillman with an O'Connor Roll, which turns into the prelude to POST MATCH INSANITY!

  
RESULTS: Sting and Luger def. Pillman and Anderson (Sting pinned Pillman)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, Ric Flair comes out and attacks Luger, and this leads to a 3-on-2 beatdown, because I guess that Benoit wasn't needed here for further numbers? I dunno. Flair also decks a ref, and then GUESS WHO HAS TO INTERJECT HIMSELF INTO THINGS?!?!?! Okay, so remember how earlier in the night, I was “Holy sh\*tting” over how Hogan made damn sure that he could take on the big 7 foot guy all by himself, AND make himself look better than the World champion by recovering from a Giant attack while Savage kinda got stuck in a coma? Well here, he makes Sting and Luger look like chumps by TAKING ON 3/4 OF THE HORSEMEN ALL BY HIS \*\*\*\*ING SELF! To paraphrase Uproxx writer Brandon Stroud, Hogan has returned to Red and Yellow, and so has his matches and storylines. Hogan then decides to go after LUGER, because reasons, Sting stops him, and less than 24 hours after saying “I will never question you again”, HOGAN \*\*\*\*ING QUESTIONS STING FOR HIS \*\*\*\*ING MOTIVES! They handshake it out, but holy sh\*t... 1995 Hogan seriously makes Kevin Sullivan look like Mother \*\*\*\*ing Teresa as far as wrestling character morality goes...

PART 2 -WWE MONDAY NIGHT RAW 11/27/1995  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-What a way to cold open the show - with video footage of last week's HBK passing out situation, and Vince narrating it as a “the rest of the show was fake, but THIS IS REAL” type scenario. One of many punches to the face that kayfabe would take over the next few years, and we haven't even gotten to “I RESPECT YOU, BOOKER MAN!” yet.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
1: RAD RADFORD VS AHMED JOHNSON

  
I've talked about Radford before, noting that he is future wrestling tragedy Louie Spicolli working a grunge music gimmick, and apparently was trying to join up with Skip as a Bodydonna. Here's something I had never noticed before though: his music would get repurposed for The Headbangers later on. Note: this theme song is neither grunge music, nor is it music that people would headbang to in a mosh pit, so it's DOUBLE inappropriate! I guess the WWF never thought to make a “punk music guy” gimmick to go with that theme. Anyhow, if you like bad mid 90's WWF punching, THIS is the match for you! I think the most exciting thing to happen besides the finish is Bob Backlund showing up in the audience as he continues to campaign for President. Ahmed countering a back body drop with his Pearl River Plunge was pretty choice, because I've always loved the Tiger Bomb, but otherwise yeah, this was just a short, boring squash. 

  
RESULTS: Johnson def. Radford via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-And now, the true highlight of the match: Lawler tries to get a word with Johnson! Lawler makes a great “LOL you're stupid” joke about how Johnson was so excited to graduate from kindergarten, he had a hard time shaving without cutting himself - throwing Dean Douglas under the bus for coming up with that - and I'd repeat what Johnson said, but hahahaha, holy sh\*t... Even turning the subtitles on couldn't help me decipher it, most of it was captioned as “\[Indistinct\]”, which sounds about right to me. Douglas comes out to have words about how to be a WWF Superstar, which is kind of like the WWF hiring Hugh Morris to train future Superstars (wait...), Ahmed has syllables that are supposed to approximate words in response, and violence is teased but never happens. ANYTHING can happen in the WWF, except for Ahmed Johnson promos that are intelligible!   


&amp;#x200B;

  
2: AJA KONG AND TOMOKO WATANABE VS ALUNDRA BLAYZE AND KYOKO INOUE

  
WCW wants to give us Japanese ladies on Nitro and their PPV? We'll give them Japanese ladies as well, damnit pal! Okay, sure, the quality is lower level here per capita than what we saw over on WCW but damn, anything that gets Aja Kong on my tv screen is aces in my books! Naturally, much of the match is spent with Vince being all “BAHAHAHAHA! A FAT WOMAN!” at Kong, because we can't have nice things. The bad news is that this match is structured less like a Joshi classic, and more like a slower paced WWF match than what we saw on the OTHER channel, but the good news is that sh\*t, even half paced, half intensity Joshi wrestling is still way ahead of its time for 1995 standards, and would be considered pretty good by 2018 standards. If you want to hear the crowd pop for women they don't know and probably don't give two sh\*ts about, listen to the cheer Inoue gets for doing the Kurt Angle run-up-to-the-top Avalanche Belly to Belly to Watanabe, a few years before pro wrestling even had a Kurt Angle! And if you want to see the one spot that made The Intern pop (with LOLs), witness Kong running into the ring, attacking Blayze from behind, and basically KICKING HER IN THE TAINT, hahaha! The finish was a bit hard to enjoy, as for some reason Vince went on a rant about how both Aja Kong and Princess Di are advocates of safe sex (????), and something about some Norwegian condom company (additional ??????), and while I was scratching my head wondering what the \*\*\*\* he was talking about, Kong blasts Inoue with the Uraken and gets the win. I don't know what Kong REALLY thinks about safe sex, but I know that prior to this win, she \*\*\*\*ed Inoue hard with a Dangerous Backdrop, hardly sounds safe to me, ahem.

  
RESULTS: Kong and Watanabe def. Blayze and Inoue (Kong pinned Inoue)  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Hey, it's the Something To Wrestle live show! Wait, sorry, seeing Bruce Prichard always triggers podcast thoughts... But yeah, it's The Brother Love Show, with special guest Bret Hart, and I have to go full disclosure mode here: I know that Meltzer sh\*t entirely on the gimmick when it was first debuted in the 80's, but as a young pre-Intern? I absolutely loved the Brother! Even as a child, I had watched enough tv to have felt that televangelism was super ridiculous and corrupt, and here was this red faced dude completely riffing on that whole deal, yeah, I was thoroughly amused then, and am even moreso now that I, you know, listen to Bruce in podcast form on a weekly basis. So much of this segment feels like it should be a colossal waste of time, with Love basically only saying “Hey, you're a marked man and have a lot of people who want to take you on for your title”, and then immediately pulling the mic away whenever Bret tries to say anything, but Prichard is so ridiculous in this role, it's such great old school heat, PLUS denying Bret a chance to say words in 1995 isn't a bad thing, so this worked for me. Bret finally grabs the mic, and he has HARSH WORDS for Diesel. Well, harsh by Canadian standards, he calls him CHEAP! GASP! Bret! You kissed thousands of women who aren't your wife with that mouth?!?!?! He also cuts a promo about how he's going to beat the British Bulldog at the next In Your Hose, pronounced that was because Western Canada. And then randomly, BOB BACKLUND rushes the ring and locks Hart into the Crossface Chicken Wing! Hahaha, oh \*\*\*\*, this is building to that terrible submission match those two had, isn't it? A match so bad even Bret hates on it.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
3: HUNTER HEARST HELMSLEY VS SOME JOBBER

  
During the future Triple H's entrance, we get picture in picture promo footage of Henry Godwin introducing us to his pigs, for that Hog Pen match they'll be having at IYH. I don't want to say that Godwin is a pig \*\*\*\*er or anything, but listen to the tone of his voice as he talks about them, there is a 100% chance that he \*\*\*\*ed those pigs. Anyhow, if you thought the opening match was a boring squash, then consider this: the most exciting thing to happen here is Hunter pinning his jobber foe by basically just grinding his d\*ck into the jobber's face during a lateral press! Anyhow, it's an old HHH match, you know how it goes: lots of moves involving Hunter's knee, and for good measure, he rips off the Ahmed finish by countering a back body drop with the Pedigree. 

  
RESULTS: Helmsley def. Jobber via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-We get a brief pre-recorded interview with Cornette and Owen Hart, who is apparently looking for his next challenge. And is using the whole “HBK passed out after an enzuigiri” thing as a bragging point about how he hospitalizes people. Never forget that Owen was the Gawddamn BEST!  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: MAIN EVENT - KAMA MUSTAFA VS THE UNDERTAKER

  
...looks like it might not happen, as Kama comes out with crutches, and not a swanky pimp cane as he would in later years. Instead, DiBiase has procured the services of another wrestler to be his stand in, so we get...  


&amp;#x200B;

  
4: ACTUAL MAIN EVENT - SIR MO (W/TED DIBIASE AND KAMA MUSTAFA) VS THE UNDERTAKER (W/PAUL BEARER)

  
Vince declares “IT'S BONE COLD IN HERE!” as Taker makes his entrance, and I can't help but think that “Bone Cold” would STILL have been a better nickname for Austin than Chilly McFreeze. Or The Ringmaster at that. Funny enough, the whole “Kama is injured” thing is pretty much revealed to be a lie within the first couple of minutes of the match; Undertaker gets clotheslined to the floor after DiBiase distracted him by grabbing hit foot. However, Taker lands on his feet, tries to Chokeslam Ted, and IT'S A MIRACLE! Kama tosses the crutches aside and starts beating on Taker while Mo keeps the ref's attention focused on himself! There's not much else to say about the match beyond “this is boring 1995 WWF kicky punchy chinlocky sh\*t”, but I do want to give props to Mo here, not only for being a great big guy bumper when he's on defense, but for remembering to put over Taker's weird Phenom Of The Opera face mask by selling his hand whenever he lands a face punch. I think the wrong MOM guy got the big push honestly. He also sells “Oh no, I'm about to get put into a Chokeslam!” by WAVING HIS ARMS like one of Bayley's Inflatable Tube Men, and sells getting hit with the Chokeslam (which finishes the match) by flopping like a fish out of water. Mo kinda ruled, and I'm sad I never realized it at the time.

  
RESULTS: Undertaker def. Mo via pinfall  


&amp;#x200B;

  
\-Post-match, King Mabel fat man waddles his way to ringside, and tries to steal the gold chains that were once Taker's urn (I forgot that storyline was even going on), but Taker grabs it first. But then UH OH, Yokozuna ALSO shows up to have a showdown with Taker. Nothing really comes of it, but Mabel attacks Bearer from behind and flees with the former urn. That was a whole lot of overbooked post-match angle for so little angle actually happening, wow.  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
TV RATINGS: Nitro def. Raw 2.5 to 2.3. Speaking as objectively as possible, WHY THE \*\*\*\* DID ANYONE WATCH RAW OVER NITRO THIS WEEK?!?!?! Seriously, if it wasn't for a bunch of Joshi showing up, and an entertaining Brother Love segment, Raw would have had ZERO GOOD THINGS ON IT! And even that one good Joshi match that Raw put on, Nitro overshadowed it with a much better one! In a better world, Nitro would have won with 4.5 to 0.3, and I'd be watching this on the WCW Network probably. PULL YOUR SH\*T TOGETHER 23 YEAR OLD WWF CONTENT!  


  
HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK: Quick, how many of you thought that it was going to be anything BUT the Joshi match on Nitro? Now all of you who raised your hands, how many of you even read my review? I THOUGHT so! All silliness aside, yeah, that match would have rocked our faces if the women of the WWE pulled it off in 2018, it was so ground breaking for 1995 that I don't even think we were ready for it. Even though it was still pretty tame compared to Japanese standards at the time. But what do I know? I don't even think the match existed, as Steph hadn't invented women's wrestling yet.  


  
LOWLIGHT OF THE WEEK: Man, through two entire shows, I kept thinking to myself that nothing would top Hogan vs Morris on the Lowlight scale. Two of my least favorite in ring performers of the mid 90's sharing the ring together, how could ANYTHING be worse than that? And don't get me wrong, it was BAD, but the WWF basically went “Hold my beer” and gave us a show where 75% of the matches were sub-Hogan/Morris quality. I'm giving the nod to the Taker/Mo main event because honestly, even though the other two Raw matches were just squashes, they STILL felt more like actual matches than the main did. The main event just felt like one long, extended angle that happened between bells. Or like one of those bad 2K game story mode matches where you wrestle for a minute, and then it devolves into cutscenes and quick time events. Only the match, cutscenes, AND QTEs are 100% bad punches.   


  
NEXT WEEK: Hogan has been whining like a little girl about how HE should be the champion, so can you guess who's getting a shot at Savage's title? If your answer is “Lex Luger”, then you've probably seen this episode before, or realize that “Savage and Luger still have beef over the arm breaking thing” is the more viable storyline anyway. I bet Hogan is going to be perfectly fine with this and not elbow any more referees! Also, in a match we've never seen before on WWF programming (ahem), Dean Douglas challenges Razor Ramon for the IC title! BE THERE or miss another Brother Love segment!

9pcc60,728,2018-10-18,[MF] Fucking my friend and breaking months of sexual tension.,doingthewormdance,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/9pcc60/mf_fucking_my_friend_and_breaking_months_of/,"This just happened last night and I figured I’d make it my first story on here while it’s fresh on my mind.  Please excuse typos and formatting I’m typing this on my phone. 

Dan and I have been colleagues and then close friends for several months. We’re both college students and became interns at the same firm. I’ve always found him to be extremely attractive: he’s 6ft and quite fit, with dirty blonde hair, a sexy 5 day old well groomed beard, and the most gorgeous light eyes and lashes. People compliment his eyes on a daily basis.  I suspected he thought I was attractive, mostly because mutual friends would mention it was clear, and I caught him glancing at my ass. I’m 5ft6 and thin with small perky boobs and what I’ve been told is a very nice butt. 

We hung out platonically, mostly in group settings, but whenever we would hangout alone there was definitely some tension. Sometimes we’d be sitting a bit too closely for friends, barely allowing our legs to touch, but nothing would ever happen. He had a girlfriend when we’d first met and I didn’t want to get in the way of that. So we just became good friends, talking about everything and anything. Over a month ago his girlfriend and him broke up, but at this point we were such good friends I was trying to put my attraction to him out of my mind. 

Tonight after work he gave me a ride home, and when we arrived I asked if he wanted to come in for a bit for a bowl and a quick Netflix episode- not an unusual activity for us. We sat on opposite ends of the couch watching a dumb comedy show, until I put my legs up so I could lie down and they ended up on his lap. He began to subtly rub my legs with his fingers, and after a while I felt what I thought was him getting hard under my foot. We started moving closer and closer to each other, until we were just barely paying attention to the show in front of us, and acutely aware of each other’s breathing and swallowing. We kept stealing glances at each other, hesitant to push it further. Finally he tilted my head towards his and kissed me deeply. I instantly moaned into his mouth as months of built up sexual tension were released. 
“We shouldn’t do this” I said. 
“You’re always such a good girl, be bad for tonight” 

 After that things moved a lot more quickly, we started passionately making out and he laid on top of me, taking my shirt off. He kissed from my neck to my collarbone, all the way down my stomach, touching and caressing every inch of my body. By this point I was already dripping wet. He got my pants off and just stared at my body for a moment, letting out a quiet “fuck. You’re so hot”- that drove me wild. He flipped me over and played with my ass for a good amount of time, kissing it and massaging it, and leaving a hickey on my left cheek. He’d sneak in licks of my pussy which made me squirm with delight. At this point I took his shirt off and was greeted with abs and muscular arms I was not expecting. We both explored each other’s bodies with our mouths hungrily. I bit his collarbone, swirled my tongue around his ear, and kissed down his stomach. I told him to lay down and started to give him a blowjob, licking from the base of his penis to the tip, flicking the tip against my tongue, and finally putting it all in my mouth. I touched myself while I blew him, which he vocally encouraged. 

Eventually he stopped me and started fucking me in missionary, kissing my neck and face as I grabbed onto him. I climbed on top of him and rode him, scratching the shit out of his back as I held on- which I could tell he really enjoyed. As he thrusted into me he grabbed my hips hard and slapped my ass while I breathed heavily into his ear. We couldn’t get enough of each other, it was some of the most intense sexual chemistry I’ve ever felt. 
He told me I was a lot dirtier than he imagined before flipping me over on my stomach, putting my hands behind my back and holding them there, pulling my hair slightly, and fucking me hard in that position. He kept going, groaning loudly into my ear until my eyes rolled to the back of my head and he pulled out- cumming a LOT all over my ass and back. When he was done he cleaned me up and kissed me. 

We jumped into the shower together and kept kissing as we washed each other. Later on we sat on the couch in our underwear, making out and caressing each other, talking about how intensely attracted to each other we have been. We’re definitely planning on doing it again.

9pchxm,3,2018-10-18,"21 years old and cannot get a credit card or open a bank account, unsure of what to do.",dizzabelle,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9pchxm/21_years_old_and_cannot_get_a_credit_card_or_open/,"I am a 21 year old college student from a rural town in the midwest, now going to school in a bigger city. Last summer, after earning my first real money at a summer internship, I was reading financial advice and decided to try to get a credit card. I applied for one made for students online (I think it was through Discover?) and was turned down because of ""COLLECTION"".

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I think this is from:

I got a credit report and my credit seems okay (730ish?) but I think that the collection is in reference to a debt that I paid to a debt collector earlier in the year. I've now done more research and realized I should have asked for verification when I was presented with the debt, but at the time it seemed possible to me that there was a medical bill I had missed paying. I went to the ER a few times in college and recently transferred schools, so I thought that maybe I had missed a bill they mailed to my old student mailbox, even though I thought I had paid all the bills I received. Either way, at that point I had no idea what was going on and panicked and paid the guy over the phone when he called. It was something like $100, so I wasn't too worried and it felt like that was how to make the problem go away.

&amp;#x200B;

Except for now I cannot get a credit card to build my credit (I have a debit card from my small hometown bank), and apparently applying for credit cards hurts your credit score so I am scared to apply for another one since I figure they will just turn me down too.

&amp;#x200B;

I called my parents and talked to them about this, and my dad's advice was to open a new bank account here (which would also be useful because my current bank is only in the midwest) and then after I have an account and a debit card try to get a credit card through the same bank.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I applied to Chase to open a savings/checking account with the money I have saved from my internship, but was given a rejection that said this:

&amp;#x200B;

""Thank you for your interest in opening an account with us. Unfortunately, we have decided not to open an account for you now, based on information contained in your consumer report(s) from the consumer reporting agency(ies) listed below. The consumer reporting agency(ies) that provided your consumer report(s) played no part in our decision and is/are unable to supply specific reasons for our decision. However, you have a right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to know the information contained in your consumer report at a consumer reporting agency. You also have a right to a free copy of your report from each consumer reporting agency listed below, if you request it from the consumer reporting agency within 60 days of receiving this notice. If you find that any information contained in a report you receive is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to dispute the matter directly with the consumer reporting agency. ""

&amp;#x200B;

The agency is Experian, and I am assuming this is also because of the collection thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love any advice on how to do damage control in this situation, recommendations on credit cards I might still be able to get/other ways to build credit, any information on how long I can expect to be unable to get a credit card/bank account, or even advice on what to avoid doing since at this point I feel like all of my steps have just led to hurting my credit even more.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I'm working on getting my credit report, but the online request would not go through so I had to do it over the phone. The robot says it will be mailed in 15 days, but unfortunately this is to my parent's address, not where I am currently living. I'm not sure why I couldn't do it online, I was able to get access to my report earlier this summer on the site."
9pcm7z,6,2018-10-18,"I feel like I'm working too hard but at the same time, not working hard enough.",Fuzakenna_,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/9pcm7z/i_feel_like_im_working_too_hard_but_at_the_same/,"I'm learning code through a coding boot camp (I also take a data structures class at my local CC for no grade credit). If you've never heard about them, they teach CS concepts, usually web development, in the span of 3-6 months. Completely changed my life and I'm not even done with the class yet. I'm halfway through the program and I have an internship related to CS I'm doing as well.   

So, I go to my boot camp class, work a regular part time job, go to my CC class, and do work at my internship. I can handle all of this pretty well and I'd say I'm pretty far along this ""career change"" journey than most in my class. Recently, I've been getting good at studying everything and it doesn't take as long to get CS concepts down as they used to. I don't have to practice as much now. I used to stay up late studying coding, or studying difficult coding concepts. I've replaced that with my internship work. I think those reasons combined is why I feel like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything y'all could suggest to get past this.

I am looking for a princess that doesn't mind her Daddy showering her over and over with attention whether that means spoiling and rewarding her...or disciplining her when needed. I am sweet and tender...but I am also firm and strict as well. I am fine with waiting, but I will need to receive pictures at some point in the future. I also like to have a princess to write some erotic stories with. I promise to never do anything that will threaten your family, career, or personal life.

9pdaxd,26,2018-10-18,Would it be lucrative for me to consider working in Poland in business?,Zarski843,poland,https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/9pdaxd/would_it_be_lucrative_for_me_to_consider_working/,"I was born in Poland, but raised in the United States since I was 4. I speak English fluently, and I speak Polish fluently although it is at a grade-school level. I have both my American and Polish citizenships. I have my Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology (Minor in Sociology), I have my Master of Science degree in Applied Clinical Psychology, and I am currently attending a good American university in a pretty good business program to get my Masters in Business Administration (MBA), focused in International Business. That is pretty much my quick background.  


So my professor was speaking to me today, and he was telling me that I would be an extremely valuable asset to several Polish businesses given my American education, dual citizenships, and fluency in both languages. He said I could find my way into some fantastic job options after I graduate, and he stated that he is willing to try to connect me with a couple week long internship at the Warsaw School of Economics so that I can improve my language on a professional level. He said that I would specifically be a good fit for various Human Resource Management companies in Poland, among a few others. 

  
I guess my questions are regarding the approximately salary that I could expect doing something like this. I know its a very specific question, but does anyone know if this is a lucrative market where I could make a solid amount of money given my background? I know Poland has a hot emerging economy, but I am wondering if they would actually invest in a ""foreigner"" like myself.   


Thoughts?"
9pdq0s,8,2018-10-18,A woman [F/30] that I've [M/29] wanted to date for 8 years is finally single--and I just started dating someone,Englishguy84,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9pdq0s/a_woman_f30_that_ive_m29_wanted_to_date_for_8/,"Summer after my junior year of college (8+ years ago), I met an amazing girl a year older than me at a summer program. All of the ""normal"" great qualities--smart, funny, beautiful--but more than that, I feel a sort of electric connection. I'm not sure how to explain it: essentially, her way of seeing the world and relating to her own feelings was both very close to mine, and yet so much more developed that it was illuminating and exciting to me. I felt a strong connection from the first days of knowing her, and over time, I found out that she did, too. Two years later, she helped me get an internship at her firm, and we ended up working together for a few months, and it confirmed that impression (but it was draining for me--see below). Nothing ever happened, although there were moments where we came pretty close. We stayed in off-and-on touch over the years. There's some not-great stuff about her, which I'll get to below, but that's why I'm even writing this. There's something about her that's special to me, that I haven't experienced with anyone else, platonically or romantically. I met her at a time when I didn't have a lot of self confidence, and she believed in me in a way that no one else I knew seemed to, which gave me the confidence to make some changes in my senior year of college that I needed to make. That belief in me, and the changes that I made, made senior year the best year of college for me.

The entire time I've known her, she's been in a relationship with the same guy. I never met him, and she didn't mention him very much. (When she did, it'd be out of nowhere, and it'd change the vibe instantly.) The summer I met her, they were fighting and hadn't been speaking much. The three months we were working together, they ""took a break"" because he wasn't sure if he wanted to commit. Apparently, this year, after ten years together, she broke up with him because she wasn't feeling prioritized, and she didn't feel like he was doing enough to try to change that. This was about two months ago. I don't know what his side of the story is, but he's getting a PhD, and she seems like she could be needy, so it might not be as clear-cut as what she says. This is the first time, by her own admission, that she hasn't had a boyfriend or a ""prospect"" in her adult life: she has a really hard time with being alone. As long as I'm listing some of her issues, I should also mention that she's one of the wealthiest people I've ever met and is correspondingly pretty darn insulated/not down to earth. She's always looking for something more, which in some sense I connect with, but in other senses, she strikes me as simply being too privileged to settle down and commit to something. She comes across as a bit waiflike, a bit too delicate, a bit too needing of special treatment or attention (she was tooooo close with her mother when I first met her; it sounds like she's in therapy for that now). She told me that she's realized her next boyfriend will need to have a ""flowing relationship with money"" because she likes to express love by being generous with gifts/treats, and wants the same.

Now, both times I was around her regularly (the summer program, working together), it started out great and quickly became wrenching for me because she wasn't available. Both years, she started out very open, honest, warm, emotionally forthright. I found out early on that she had a boyfriend, so I tried to be very respectful of her boundaries. She'd push those boundaries: she invited me to get a drink; she invited me over to her apartment; she'd suggest we go hiking together next weekend, that kind of thing. But then, when I'd actually follow up to try to schedule something, she'd flake. Wouldn't return my text or call. Would respond hours later with an excuse. We'd have two hour conversations where she'd cross the normal personal-space-between-friends line, then mention her boyfriend out of nowhere, then disappear the next day. Then a couple days later, she'd be ""back"" to being open, warm, etc. The up-and-down nature of it, and the difficulty of starting to fall for someone who was simultaneously available and unavailable, was too much for me to take. I couldn't tell if I was being used by someone who clearly was in a problematic relationship (given the fights and breakups) to feel special. Or at the minimum, she was behaving without regard for my feelings. It got so difficult, I pulled a Jim Halpert and quit the job because I couldn't stand to see her every day. I studied for the LSAT, got into law school, and lived my own life. Didn't think about her much, except as a flaky Stevie Nicks wannabe from my past. Dated someone for four years that ended for unrelated reasons and have been single for a year.

I just recently started dating someone semi-seriously (although we haven't had the ""what are we"" talk yet, it's clearly coming up). It's only been a couple of months, but I like her. This new person is dependable, warm, down to earth, kind, and very affectionate. I don't feel that she's searching for something the way the girl I'm talking about in this post is. I don't feel like we're connected on a spiritual or that deep psychological level even though we have similar values, goals, priorities, and love languages (touch and words, not spending money or favors). I feel very comfortable with the new girl--like I can be my natural self around her--and if the relationship continued to go well, she's the kind of person I could imagine moving in with, etc.

Part of me wants nothing more to do with crush-girl because I can see all of the red flags. But part of me can't stop thinking about the electricity I feel when I talk to her or am around her. I saw her a couple of times in the last year, and it was still there--the same feeling I remembered from 2010, when I was a very different (shyer, and more inexperienced) person. Whatever ""connection"" or ""chemistry"" means, I feel it with her. But at the same time, I know that electricity or chemistry alone isn't enough for a healthy long-term relationship. I know that I'd need to give her a lot of time and space before trying to date her. I know that there's no guarantee she wouldn't turn into a very different person if she actually commits to being single for a prolonged period of time. I know there's no guarantee that she wouldn't meet someone else. I do know that, basically, she's had a crush on me, too, at some point(s) during those times, because she's all but said it in those exact words, multiple times. She's told me I'm an important person in her life before. But her actions have never really backed that up. I guess, I kind of know what I need to do, but I just need some reassurance that it's right to let her go.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Flaky but fascinating-to-me girl I've known is single after 8 years of knowing her, I recently started dating someone, part of me wants to break it off to pursue her but it seems too risky because she's emotionally inconsistent and unreliable, but I feel conflicted because chemistry is a real thing.

9pdxrv,3,2018-10-18,"Should I (F19) tell my financially self-conscious parents (M&amp;F, 50-60) that I paid part of my medical bills?",nenadelmar,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9pdxrv/should_i_f19_tell_my_financially_selfconscious/,"I know this seems like a silly question, but hopefully some context will reveal why it makes me nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

My family is considered low-income at the university I attend, which is pretty accurate. Not to mention we have gone through some financial crises that have been out of our control in the past couple of years, so for a little while now money has been really really tight. I am pretty much totally dependent on them as they pay my tuition (we are on a lot of financial aid so it's not a horrible amount, but since we are low income it's still a strain), and I live with them when I go back home. I did however work two internships this past summer, I work while I'm at school, and I've worked part time since I was 16. As a result, I have an okay amount of money in my banking accounts, and I rarely ever ask them for day to day financial help. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago while playing soccer, I ruptured my achilles tendon. I hope I don't sound like I'm winning because I know injuries could be much much worse, but it really has been a nightmare. Because I go to school three hours away from home, as well as the fact that I'm in the middle of a very rigorous school quarter, *as well* as the fact that my parents don't have a reliable means of transportation to get here, this has already been very expensive, messy, and inconvenient. We just got the estimate for the hospital bill and it's not pretty. Not terrible, but I know it's going to cause more of a strain. And this doesn't include the approximately six months of Physical Therapy I'm going to need as a result of this, which is also going to be super expensive. On the phone I could tell my mom was struggling to keep calm when I told her the number, and she kept saying stuff like ""we'll figure it out, we'll manage, we'll figure it out."" which isn't super reassuring.

&amp;#x200B;

I was feeling terribly guilty about all of this, since I feel like this my fault (I probably could have avoided this if I had done a better job stretching before practice).  Since everything is under my name because of my insurance, I just kind of on a whim called the financial office and put down a deposit with my own card that will cover about half of the bill. It only took out about half of my savings. So not great, but not terrible. And to be honest, my intentions aren't super altruistic. A more selfish part of me just wants to stop feeling like I owe my parents anything as soon as I can. My sister is the exact opposite of me (Always asking for money, living at home after graduation, etc.) and I can see how it has damaged her relationship with my parents and also allowed them to control her to some aspect. I know that the sooner I can start taking accountability for my own finances, the easier it will be to live an independent life after I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

The dilemma I have is that I know my parents will not be happy if I point blank tell them I'm absorbing some of the cost. Especially my dad, who is the type of guy who would sell his own kidneys before admitting to his children that we're struggling financially. Honest, I expect him to straight up upset with me for this. I think in his eyes, it makes him feel like he's not doing a good job as a parent if his kid is having to provide for themselves in some way (which, again, is mostly untrue because I only paid half the bill and they still pay my tuition and other stuff). As a result, a part of me just wants to tell them that the bill ended up being much less than we thought, or maybe that my university ended up covering half of it (which isn't super far fetched because I go to a well endowed school that has lots of perks for its low income students). I also don't want them to end up feeling like they owe me because of the dependency thing I mentioned above. I feel like they're going to try and compensate by putting money in my account or whatever, and I honestly don't want that.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't want them to feel like they are being bad parents or that they have let me down, and I *certainly* don't want those feelings to manifest themselves in a way that is negative, which is not uncommon (especially for my dad, as I mentioned). We really do just need to be a happy family as much as possible right now, and I don't want this to stir the pot. Besides, I'm 19 years old, I'm really not that far off from living on my own and supporting myself 100% when I graduate, so I feel like they should respect the choices I make with my money. On the other hand, I'm not a parent so I don't know if my mentality is unfair towards the feelings of my parents. What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; I paid half of my own medical bills, but I'm nervous that my parents, who are super self conscious and defensive of our families finances, will take it the wrong way. As a result, I'm not sure if I should tell them outright that I covered some, or sweep it under the rug in some subtle lie and hope they don't ask."

9pelvn,3,2018-10-18,"Discovered and working to apply LoA post-breakup, still desire my ex but wanting to 'detach'",dsong_,lawofattraction,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/9pelvn/discovered_and_working_to_apply_loa_postbreakup/,"My ex and I were together for a year until she broke things off - the reason being that she no longer felt romantically toward me anymore. She told me it's been a privilege to be with me and she didn't think she'd grown as much as she had with anyone else. This was my first relationship and I was fighting very hard to keep things together, only giving up when we were at a breaking point but leaving it back on the table that I'm only doing so because she not's fulfilling her part in the relationship. On that very night we reconnected and would start fresh, seeing how we went after a month. A key thing for me was thinking ""if I bring this up, she might panic and leave me again"", and I did see some improvement so I kept my worries to myself. However looking back, I guess I sort of attracted the outcome I was fearing. She was tearfully telling me that she really wanted us to remain friends but emphasised I had no obligation to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

I pleaded for her to come back one day after, she was disheartened to see me unwell but I realised that I was only making it worse. I then told her I had to cut her out of my life and she understood, wishing me all the best. What follows was a confusing period of me senselessly and emotionally reaching out to all sorts of reactions. After a bit of back and forth I met with her and resolved that since getting back together was unfeasible, I did want to stay as friends but I needed the space to heal. She was very moved by this, but also told me that we're not necessarily split forever and that nothing in the future is really foreseeable, we may end up together again potentially. 

&amp;#x200B;

I met up again with her briefly a week later to just discuss seeing each other at work. I did tell her that I realised our separation was necessary and she was relieved to hear it. She told me she hoped to see me the following shift because she had my birthday present ready. Along with the present was a heartfelt letter telling me how grateful she was for the relationship, thanking me for being a dedicated and loving partner, and that she missed me dearly and genuinely hoped to connect in the future. There were quite a swell of emotions from this. This was about 2 weeks after the split.

&amp;#x200B;

A month of NC started from there where I looked to being my best self. I secured an internship, hammered at my studies, did things I normally shirked away from, and tried to cultivate self-love etc. However I was also looking upon how-to-get-your-ex back guides which shook my focus. After the month ended, in a moment of emotional relapse and longing, I reached out to her, immediately suggesting to meet up. We chatted slightly and had a brief phone call. It was just a friendly phone call, nothing really wrong with that but I felt a bit off-put as I was expecting a more positive and warm reception. She was excited to hear about my internship and we caught up on what we were doing for the past month. I was hoping she would be more excited and we could see each other but I was bit deflated when she told me she had no time to be meeting anyone really - which I somewhat expected because she's a busy person. The resulting emotions and pain almost felt like the beginning of the breakup. I decided I wanted to be a truly stronger person from then on - more than I had been before by finally casting away all my doubts and fears. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been about 2 months now from our breakup. About a week ago I discovered the law of attraction after contemplating how I continuously can be bogged down by my negative emotions despite my improvements. Since then I've been applying affirmations, visualisations, and meditation and I can say that I am mentally much more capable and more confident. I tried to manifest my ex in some capacity but I recently I realised I was still thinking about her too much through the day. I'd be dwelling upon our tougher and more stressful times, which was quite unproductive so I've turned many of those thoughts to positive ones of being appreciative and grateful for our wonderful times and the contribution she made in my life as my first partner. Also makes me a bit uncomfortable at times too but I find that our physically intimiate moments creep back into my head. I can't deny that our sexual activity dropped off so much toward the end so I'm concerned that my attachment and desire for intimacy, (which I am careful that it doesn't turn into craving) might be tainting my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days ago I sent her a friend request on Facebook which has been unanswered. It was disappointing and my heart still aches sometimes but it's as if my mind is on another level and I can effectively isolate my thoughts from my emotions now. During my meditation and visualisation I try to keep it not necessarily about her and visualise just the closeness of holding hands with a partner. If I do end up having her in mind then I try to give out my positive vibes and love, wishing her happiness and all the best. The future I envisioned during our time together and occasionally try to manifest was just living together and me cooking her breakfast while she still sleeps. 

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely want to have another go at our relationship to apply all the insights, growth and learning I've experienced, but I leave it in the hands of the universe to give me this person or someone better, even if it takes longer than expected. I believe that by doing this I can feel detached from the outcome despite the feeling of longing and pain. I am also keeping in mind that this is my first break-up and it's only been 2 months of recovery, and this is all so new to me. Would love people's thoughts and this and sharing of similar experiences.

9peypi,1,2018-10-18,25 [GM4F] - Office of Sluts,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9peypi/25_gm4f_office_of_sluts/,"Most days in most companies have a typical sequence of events. The employees get in at around 9, some stragglers reach around 10. They spend some time getting caught up with their work and coworkers before getting to work (seemingly) until lunch. The afternoon is more work but also some counting down to 5 PM so that the workers can go home and get ready to repeat that process the next day. But Nymph Corp isn’t a typical office. 

There is an unusual ratio of women to men in their main office. For every 2 men there are 8 women and it seems that the women are the ones who hold most leadership positions and any authority. The multi-floor building that is the main office is surrounded by one way windows to prevent anyone from looking inside and all the entrances have guards who are handsomely compensated for making sure no one out of place gets too close. 

Jane has been an assistant at Nymph Corp for about half a year now and she is just barely getting the hang of things. The culture of the company had left her shocked initially but given the compensation, job security, location and benefits package she had decided to accept it. Her day to day was very different from the average assistant’s day. 


It was currently 2 PM and she held a tray of coffees for her superiors that she HAD to get to them in the afternoon everyday. Wearing a simple long gray skirt, a red conservative sweater and simple heels she made her way through the halls of the building hurriedly. Jane was 22 years old and about 5’6” in height, caramel skinned, had a slim body with some curves that would turn heads if she wasn’t so bent on keeping them hidden. Her ass alone, like most Latina women around her age, was large and round despite her small waist. She tended to keep to herself, work hard and stay clear of any trouble.

She quickly walked to Miss Sarah’s office, she was an account executive for the company, and knocked on the door politely. “Mmmm come on in,” said a seductively voice from the other side with some moans. Jane braces herself and entered.

Miss Sarah was an attractive blonde Eastern European woman of medium height and curves that went very well with her figure. She was currently wearing just a black lace bra with her leather skirt, black pumps, shirt and thong lying to the side. Bent over her desk with her pressed against it, she moaned and gasped as David her intern plunged his cock deep in and out of her vagina. His hips slammed into her round tight white ass with each thrust making her moan and scream while he grunted and moaned a little himself.

“Mmmph leave ahhh the coffee ah ah you’re so good in my cunt ah on the desk Jane,” she said between moans, gripping the edge of her desk to steady herself. 

Jane quietly puts the coffee on the desk and tries to maintain her composure. This wasn’t anything new to her at this point but it still flustered her each time. 

She left the room and took a deep breath to gather herself before continuing on her coffee run. Jane knew this wouldn’t be the only such incident today. She walked on and reached the office of Mrs Stacey who usually left her door open. But Jane still decided to knock before walking in.

Mrs Stacey was currently lying on her desk with her head over one edge and her legs over the other with Joe and Frank on either side. She was of Spanish descent and her skin was a tanned shade that many women spend money to achieve. She was just about 5’2” in height and was of a petite frame with modest pointy breasts, a flat stomach, shapely legs and a small tight ass. But what she lacked in curves she made up for with an insatiable sex drive. Her clothes were still on though her shirt was unbuttoned to expose her bra and her pink skirt was hiked up as her legs hung in the air. She had her hands around Joe gripping his ass as he pushed his cock in her mouth while on the other end Frank continued to penetrate her vagina. She used one hand to tap near her on the desk on noticing Jane enter.

Jane quickly leaves the coffee on the desk where Mrs Stacey tapped and exits the room while trying to keep her wits about her.

*One of these days I’ll have a heart attack* she thinks to herself. *Oh well only one left. But this is the toughest one.*

She walks over to the CEO’s office. There is no name or sign hanging over the door but everyone knew that this was Miss Roxanne’s office. She was a very ambitious 31 year old woman who constantly kept striving for more success and kept her physical condition perfect, with a body that would put many girls younger than her to shame.

Jane knocks on the door politely as usual. “Come on in!” This time the voice had no sexual innuendo. *I guess she’s having a normal day today* Jane thinks to herself as she walks in. But she’s wrong completely.

Roxanne is dressed in a pair of sexy black boots that go past her knees and to her thighs, the light bouncing off them and drawing attention to her perfect stockings clad legs. A black garter belt is around her waist and she is wearing black crotch less panties. Her abs are visible on her flat perfect stomach and her round large breasts are held in place by a simple black bra. Her hair is tied in a ponytail and in her hand is a black stick.

“Ah Jane dear, you’re just in time,” Miss Roxanne says pointing at her desk with the stick. “Leave the coffee on my desk, I’ll have it once I’m done playing with these toys.”

She looks down at the three male employees on their knees in front of her who are naked with blindfolds on and their hands tied behind their backs. Roxanne rubs the tip of her stick against one of them and holds it against his cock.

“Now whose pet are you Eric?” she says teasingly. 

“I uh I’m your pet Miss Roxanne,” he blurts out as she strokes his cock with the stick.

“Good boy,” she says before bringing the stick up and pushing it against the cocks of the other guys and continuing with her dominating.

Jane quietly walks out and goes to the washroom to wash her face. She takes a deep breath to prepare for the interview at 4 with the new boy who will be joining. It’s unconfirmed who his interviewer will be but she needs to coordinate it...


———————————————————-

So that’s the prompt, I hope you enjoyed it! As you can see it’s about an office environment full of women who are very sexual and aren’t afraid to act on their urges. It may seem like the women are in “control” and that is true at times but some are submissive while some are dominant. 

I would love to hear what you think, this is open to go anywhere. You could play a specific woman in the office or multiple and we can figure out where it should go.

My kinks are rough sex, spanking, hair pulling, dominating, giving up control, flirting, dirty talk, cheating, interracial and more.

Limits are incest, scat, blood, gore and any crazy stuff.

We can discuss further details in PMs, I look forward to hearing from you!

Also I do prefer long term over short term and replies that are a bit well thought out. We can always hash the story together and take it wherever we want. I may reply late because I will be busy for the next couple of hours.

I’m an finance major from a good state college that is graduating this winter.

My original plan for the last 4 years for after college was to join the military, and just recently got my appointment at MEPS (medical processing to join the military). Due to reasons that I do not want to disclose, relating to my health, I’ve been permanently barred from joining the military (not drugs). 

I’ve not had a plan together as I thought and was extremely confident that this would be my first four years out of college, and hadn’t done internships or searched for a job like a dumb ass.

I’m able to move in with my parents temporarily, but I do not want this to last long as I love my parents but do not want to live with them over my head. 


What steps should I take now? A finance degree gets me access to a lot of careers, but I don’t know what to do to get the ball rolling on finding a temporary career until I can afford graduate school.

This post was written in a panic, so I’m sorry if this is hard to follow fully. Any advice is very much appreciated.

When I first started school, I had both a premed track and SWE (software engineering) track in mind. I genuinely wanted to go for premed, but because of the Silicon Valley hype, fear of medical school rejection, and being a young freshman I was, I decided to go into SWE purely for money and the ""safety"" of the field.

I had a ""Cs get Degrees"" mentality throughout school. My transcript is a mess. I have a 2.7 cumulative, and I NP'ed/failed a number of classes. I'm not making excuses for it; I'm a fucking idiot for being so lazy. Now that I'm seriously considering my future, I DO NOT want to go into software engineering. The thought of doing this for 40 hours a week for the rest of my life seriously makes me claustrophobic. I feel like I just wasted my 4 years here, and I'm looking to just do what I should have done 4 years ago, which is just go for a career in medicine.

Here are my stats:

- 2.7 cumulative; coursework in Math, some stats, and CS. Low grades. C-, C+'s, B-'s, B's, and a B+.
- Most of my EC are geared towards SWE; freelance work, internship, side projects. Nothing relevant to M.D. I can start writing some apps/programs geared towards medicine if that helps.
- No coursework in Bio/Chem/Physics.
- No research.
- Haven't taken MCATs yet.

I would need to do a DIY post-bacc or go for a 2nd bachelors (and then drop out after taking prereqs) to make up for my low grades and take the bio/chem/physics courses I need. I would really appreciate some brutal honesty here. I know there are success stories of low GPA/post-bacc getting into med schools, but how much of that is skewed by survivor bias? If I get my shit together and get a 3.9+ in my 2 years of post-bacc prep, and score a decent MCAT, will this make up for my 2.7/failed classes during my time at Cal? Or does it seem extremely unlikely and should I go for a different path instead? I would still pursue a career in medicine even if M.D. wasn't an option. But preferably, I definitely would like to go to medical school. Any (brutally honest) advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

If you read my post history, you'll see that I'm from Washington, DC. I'm really proud to call such a transient city home, and going to college this close to where I grew up was a great decision. Today, I want to find someone to write a story with who can help me make this amazing town a character, somewhere that feels as real as it is to me every day. I'm hoping to use specific places as settings, and have our characters behave like locals here do.

Because I'm so dedicated to the setting of the story, the plot is something I'm still undecided on. Are we lobbying interns meeting at our bosses' cocktail hour at the Watergate? Are you my intern coordinator, taking me to Eastern Market to socialize after work? Are we long-suffering Nats fans meeting at an open air bar before a game? Maybe you have another idea completely! I'm open to a lot of ideas, as long as we can set them somewhere that feels authentic to DC. We'll definitely discuss our plot and content before we start off.

**If you feel like this is too detailed about a place you've never been, no worries! I'd love to talk about any DPP prompt I've posted before**. Either way, send me a couple options for what you want me to look like so I know you read my whole prompt! Hope to hear from you!"

I’ve had a couple interviews with law offices for paralegal jobs but I’ve had no luck. My resume isn’t very strong, although I have a good GPA. I’ve had an internship with a political campaign and I have volunteer work on it, but not much else since I switched from criminal justice to polisci. Anyway, I need a full time job. I plan on getting a masters after a few years of working and saving up, but I don’t want to just settle for some job where my degree isn’t even necessary. I live near Providence, RI so the market isn’t very big. I wouldn’t mind moving somewhere else though, I just don’t want my degree to go to waste. What should I look and apply for?"

Over the last year, I worked at a company that experienced a downpour of public fiascos of the financial and integrity variety, and in my 10 months there, maybe 75% of the staff quit.

But I didn’t quit. I didn’t even care much about these fiascos. I’m just the type of person who doesn’t mind stormy weather. As Natasha Bedingfield would say, ""feel the rain on your skin!"" And lightening, whatever, I didn't really feel much. Numb to the elements.

But as news of the company’s controversial actions flooded our Twitter feeds, and as the work became more tedious, every other member of my 10-person team quit. You could see it coming. One of my team members would mumble and swear to herself a lot, but wouldn’t answer me when I asked if she was ok. A few cried.

I didn’t expect the place to get better. “Give up if you wanna survive,” right? So I survived the longest, and I was left alone at a huge, empty bank of desks. Didn't want that isolation, right? So I asked my boss if I could use one of the vacant desks near other people. I was told I couldn’t move. I was stuck.

\-----

It's possible I was really quite emotionally receptive to a sign at this point. Like I wanted something to happen. And something did. When the Humility music video appeared on my newsfeed, it was a bright, neon, flashing sign.

I didn’t really know much about Gorillaz at the time, I’m not even sure if I knew the blue-haired guy’s name. But I had seen the old vids, and stuff on Youtube, and I recalled that the blue-haired guy had seemed pretty apathetic or anxious a lot of the time. But in Humility, something was clearly different.

He had changed. This cartoon character was smiling, with positive energy, skating around in the sunshine! Reaching out to people! I wanted to reach out to people and have fun and get excited about things! I wanted to go to Venice Beach and get sunburned and show off how good I look skating around in booty shorts!

So I changed. I stopped listening to No Children by The Mountain Goats on repeat and started listening to Humility by Gorillaz on repeat. I joined a dating/friendship app and started wearing heart-shaped sunglasses. I spent more time socializing and less time eating. I got excited about biking to work, so I actually did it more often, and did it harder and faster. The sun had metaphorically come out, also, literally, because this was June, so I guess that was also a part of my mood change and ability to ride more. I had to get smaller clothes and always picked brighter colors when I did.

Things changed at work as well. I was radiating energy when I got to the office. I reached out to the interns and tried to help them train and network, although the boss didn’t like that. I found tasks that needed to be done, that were meaningful and worthwhile. I asked very direct, but polite questions and took on new projects and scheduled meetings to collaborate with other teams.Boss didn’t like any of those things, I think.

She once, quickly, stopped by Lonely Desk Island, leaned over and said basically “Once you’re done with that project you need to go back to doing what you were hired to do.” She was right, I was hired to make a ton of low-quality product, and I wasn’t doing that. But I figured if we could get along without the other nine staff members putting out tons of product, did she really need me to? With the little time and no resources at our disposal, we couldn’t do much except mine garbage anyway.

I found I was not be able to go back to The Garbage Mines for long periods of time. It was too dark inside. I’d hesitate at the mouth of the cave every day. That was a bad place.

Halfway through July, boss asks for a meeting. I thought it COULD be about me taking on better roles at the company, because I'm amazing and have such impressive initiative and leadership. Or, what was more likely was, I was probably about to get fired.

I was right, it was the latter. She said I wasn't “meeting the goals” of producing set by another boss who had quit. She was right. They didn’t hire anyone to replace me.I don't really mind the weather now. I get unemployment insurance, so there's a silver lining. I'm actually filling in at an office where the boss said they're ""really impressed"" with my work so that's cool, and working on independent projects, and having time to meet people and experiment and go skating.

Plus, now I can feel the sun on my skin every day."
9pg7gv,6,2018-10-18,Tired of hiding my problems but I don't have anyone to talk to or that I'm willing to talk to.,Financial_Trash,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9pg7gv/tired_of_hiding_my_problems_but_i_dont_have/,"Throw away account for the shame of trying to let other people in on my struggles of being depressed but having a pretty good life. 

I have always been sad since as far back as i can remember.

From being a kid and always getting picked on by both family and classmates primarily for being an above average weight which branched to being excluded from pretty much any fun going around which quickly lead me to become very critical about what i do and how others will perceive my actions. Sadly, I channeled all of my depression and sadness into anger which landed me into anger management for throwing a desk across a classroom at a girl for making fun of me which is the last thing i can remember the early years of my life.

Jr. high was far more rough however because i was still in my own world which is equally lonely as it is crushing which made me an easy target for the bullies of my school except this time i had enough which lead to me throwing one of them into a wall which stopped the bullying for the most part. However, i had become the bully because i continued to channel my rage but now to random people which was even worse than where i was before.

As to not drag on forever and bitch about every small thing that has happened to me ill skip forward to high school which is where i met my best friend at the time i was accepted by his family so i was always over there. For the sake of privacy i'll call him jon well jon and i were very quick to becoming great friends because we were both huge nerds and loved having lan parties and more towards the end of highschool the weekend pot smoking. Jon was quite the player which is important because he got the girls i wished i could get because i had only had 1 girlfriend prior to finishing jr high but he always had a new girl as a side note he was skinny and i was still larger than most. Well as time passes i managed to get this girl who was well beyond my league she was absolutely beautiful, skinny, but most importantly she was hilarious and loving which i was not used to getting any love so it was like a drug.

The problem with lets call her Jacky is that she had chest acne but i didn't care i was head over heels for her. as time passed probably a year of dating split into several on and off periods her acne was disappearing which was important to jon because now jon saw how attractive she was and constantly asked how mad i would be (post break up) if he were to have sex with her well i was still VERY into her because she was the first girl i ever did anything naughty with but the questions kept coming up.

This is the turning part of my life. i graduated highschool and got declined from every college so i started going to community college while still keeping in touch with jacky because we agreed that we still cared for each other. Well i was hanging out with Jon and my mutual friend who was fighting with jon when it slipped that he was surprised i was still friends with jon after he had slept with my girlfriend when we were dating and as it turns out him asking if i would be mad was his way of asking ""when can i tell you that i slept with your girlfriend.""

Well, my life was crashing down because both of the people i cared about deeply and confided all my trust and love to basically tag team back stabbed me.

I stopped feeling happiness at this point only anger,frustration, depression, and loneliness because the circle that kept me together had just been torn away to reveal that they both had lied about it for about a year. 

I continued my community college because i didn't know what else to do I was just going through my routine miserably I failed my first class in my life which crushed me more and after i picked my shit up and got to work i ended up graduating community college with an associates degree for business and transferred to one of the harder schools to get accepted into because i managed to raise my GPA to a 3.5 miraculously. Looking back though i realize i am alone just completely alone i have yet to make friends just an older woman who likes to fuck around which I don't care about having because it doesn't make me happy.

Finally here we are my first semester in this new university working on my road to a finance degree with no real friends to hangout with only people i met online playing my waste of time video games just to keep myself sane. i only am a person who helps them with homework to these people. I constantly try and get myself out there and interact with the people in my class but its not real these people don't care about me I'm just useful to them then they will throw me aside and treat me like the stranger I am after the semester is over. This includes girls as well I don't want to sound like I'm upset that girls don't consider me as a possible boyfriend but its the blatant things like only texting when they need help or ignoring me when theyre not feeling it. Luckily i am able to be this pessimistic depressed person on the internet and only appear as lazy to others but i can still get my work done and get good 100% on my exam and 100% on a homework project worth a chunk of my grade but i have an incredibly hard time doing the simplest things like applying for internships because i just don't want to is that i tell myself just like how i have never had a job but i do now have some ok income by other means. 

I guess in the end I'm just tired of being a ghost to people but human when its convenient and for once i want to look at someone and know they care about me for me depression and all. 

P.S. i would consider myself to be average in terms of being attractive hence why it frustrates me more that no one i have tried dating since after highschool has considered me to be even a friend.

thank you for letting me open up my life to you strangers I appreciate you."
9pgfx0,10,2018-10-19,Study abroad,m7373m7373,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/9pgfx0/study_abroad/,"I am stuck on my choice between two study abroad programs. This is incredibly long, but if you have the time, please read and give me your opinion. If you're going to be annoyed by the length and my indecisiveness just don't read lol.The two most important things to me while studying abroad: will I get to have fun at a reasonable price? (nightlife and partying), will I be able to find others to travel around Europe with and will it be easy and affordable to do so?

1. CIEE Open Campus This program is a third party instead of direct enrollment. I get to design my experience. I am planning on spending 12 weeks in London, but I am not sure what to do with the other 6 weeks! I dont know if I'd stay in London or go to Italy, France, or south Africa. This program is really appealing because it's in London! Also there is more support with this program, I won't have to worry about too much and I am a pretty nervous person. This seems great but I'm afraid I'm not pushing myself. I'm going to list out the pros and cons.                                                        Pros: London!, support, I'm going to be with other Americans who will most likely be more willing to travel, overall program cost would be cheaper, traveling is easy and cheaper from London, I can complete an internship                
Cons: London is expensive!, not pushing myself out of my comfort zone, will only get to befriend Americans, due to the block set up it won't feel as homey as an exchange, missing out on a uni experience                                                  Will not studying at a university be less appealing in the professional sense?                                                                        My biggest pro is it's in London, a city I have always dreamed of living in and I feel there is so much less worry associated with this option                                                                                                                                                                My biggest con is that I might be missing out by not going to a University (can I still get the same authentic student experience (social scene wise?)

I honestly really want to party and have amazing nights out during my time abroad. Will I do be able to do that in London? Especially if I'm not attending a university?

This seems like the smarter choice in a lot of ways because it eliminates a chunk of stress and also there are more scholarships available through CIEE.

2. University of Manchester

My second program choice is spending 4 months at the Uni of Manchester. At first, i was hesitant because I really wanted to live in London, but through research it seems that Manchester is really amazing too. There seems to be so much life and it seems as good as London in most ways. I am going to list the pros and cons.

Pros: a true university experience, great city, more affordable cost of living, prestigious school, nightlife is amazing 

Cons: I think it will be hard to find people to travel around Europe with since they will mostly be locals who aren't always down for a weekend trip, program cost is more expensive, have to do a lot of things on my own, weather is so different from the west coast

My biggest pro is that I would be getting a true university experience. Manchester, from what I've heard, is amazing for partygoers.

My biggest con is that I think it might be more difficult for me to find others to travel around Europe with and it's more expensive to fly out of Manchester

I would really like to go to Manchester (for the nightlife and true college atmosphere) but I just don't know. It seems like the dumber choice because I would probably have to take out more loans to attend.

I don't know and it's really stressing me out. I will likely only be able to do this once, so i have to make the right choice. There is no wrong choice, but there is a better choice. What would you do?"

I broke this up into how I feel right now, and some background about my feelings. I make a request in the end of the first part if you're looking to share advice or give support.

&amp;#x200B;

**----------------FEELINGS NOW------------------------**

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling such bad anxiety lately, like the kind that hurts in your chest and throat. I'm currently out of school on a gap year trying to figure out transferring. I don't know about a school I would actually want to go to, and I am constantly looking but can't find one, I even look abroad, and at alternative universities, at different subjects, at cooperative universities. If I were to work for awhile instead, I am constantly looking at gig sites and thinking of stuff I could freelance in and stuff I could sell. Also constantly looking at places I could live for cheap, that maybe my partner would like. Constantly trying to figure out how I could tell my parents how I really feel about school so they could understand. Trying to do this and think of ways I could sustain it and be healthy and not make my stress worse so I dont get head aches. The constant spinning of my brain gears is just fucking eating meeeeee. I talk to my close friends about some of this stuff but it's not helping. I feel so alone in this too, all of my friends are either in school or graduated, and Im not working or consistently volunteering so I'm mostly alone. The anxiety and stress of having to plan my whole life all the time is making me incapable of doing anything that I want to do, or reaching about to people telling them I need help. I feel like I shut myself out from the world since I had such a bad 2 years of HS and 2 years of college, and I want to reach out again, but it's hard. I'm also trying to find a therapist now that I'm out of school, but that's hard and expensive. Everything is hard and expensive. I also want to try to let go of some of these ideas about having to work or go to school just so I can relax for a bit, and figure stuff out, but I cannot!!! I've just been thinking and thinking and making plans I cannot follow through with because my anxiety is sucking the energy out of my body. I wish someone could just take care of me, somewhere I can be social, and do things that I haven't done before, but idk where that is. I've thought about Peace Corps or Americorps or WWOOFing but that's planning I don't want to do, and idk how ethical they are and i don't want to decide, and idk if I can do work. I've thought about just traveling and just taking whatever gigs I could take, but that's more planning I just cannot do right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I want is to be better and not always be spinning out so I can make a decision I'm happy with and move on with my life. I need some help, if you have any advice or encouragement please comment. I know all this planning is going nowhere, and at this point I just want to have a handle on myself and my feelings, so I can make decisions then.

**------------Background--------------------------------------**

I recently took time off from school because of how bad it was. I went to a pretty rigorous STEM college in the US for 2 year and it was terrible. I had to take 5+ classes as a part of the core for my first year, and pretty difficult math and science courses at that, and I pretty soon developed migraines from the stress. I did okay my first semester, and actually above average in my second one, but it was so bad. I'm a PoC and the first person in my family to really go away for college, so there wasn't a lot I was really expecting. I agreed to go to my college because of the importance the placed upon being aware of the effect of your work on the world, but it was pretty clear that they didn't care. Any mention of discussion of the school's affiliation of with projects with harmful impacts or their failure to retain students or statistics about high student stress were met with outrage and confusion from professors, administrators, and certain students alike

&amp;#x200B;

A faculty member even came out saying how they were disappointed by their peers, whom they had overheard thought the college was getting worse since letting in more diverse students. I actually had a personal falling out with the diversity office about their lack of action and was met with lots of aggression, which sucked. I even ended being racially profiled by local PD when my friends and I were trying to blow off steam before finals, and asked for some flexibility due to stress and was denied (that was scary and stupid :/ ). I wrote an anonymous letter lashing out at the diversity office. Between this teacher's confession and other events on campus This eventually lead to some public forums (these were terrible by the way, our school prez is an idiot who doesn't care about us, and so are all the department heads), firings, and staff leavings. Being involved a lot of that stuff was exhausting, not just to me but everyone. That was another terrible part about school, everyone around me was depressed or tired or shut down, it seemed like no one was doing okay, even when I could muster a bit of peace for myself, it seemed like somebody was on the verge of a breakdown. Any-who, 1st semester comes and goes and 2nd semester rolls around, and then things get worse. We end up doing more organizing, but we lose 2 students to suicide (on a very small campus too), which is impacts me deeply. I didnt even know them personally but it felt like I lost 2 friends. We had all done this work to try to get some accountability but it felt like it was all for naught. At this point my stress levels were through the roof with the organizing, course work, and grief. This cause me to do some pretty stupid things romantically too, getting involved with a wishy-washy girl who was already in a relationship, who I continued to pursue in secret from my friends after it came out, which I think just made things much much worse. God I was soooo stressed about that too, and the resulting fights that came from that. Idk it just also sucked too i was doing so well academically while letting go of myself in other areas (getting migraines, having a messy room, messy romantically) no one from home even told me I was doing a good job, they were just so confused about why I was stressing even after I tried to explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, 2nd semester comes and goes with more protests and school work, but eventually its over and I decided to go home and not do an internship. The whole time I'm home I'm just stressed, trying to process all of those feelings but unable to. It shows, I'm not very nice to my family, but not really mean, just more closed off. And I get irritated trying to explain my school situation, I explain what happens and they just have a ""keep trucking on"" attitude which I think is dumb. I just wanted the academic parts without all this drama. I think over the summer I end up becoming more closed off, and while I consider taking leave then, i just go back to school. I met an amazing person from the school who happen to be in my home town over the summer, we end up hanging out a lot and start dating. They're nice, probably the best thing to come out of that whole experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I go back and as a more closed off guy, I don't really try hanging out with my friends who I went through all that stuff with in my first year and elect to hang out with my partner. I'm still stressed at this point, but I have a history of just not communicating things, so I don't really talk to them for awhile. And even when I do it doesn't make me feel better. Guess I'll add I saw the school counselor once a week 2nd semester and all of 2nd year, to help me with my anxiety and just sadness I had during the year. Anyway my friends and I are start having tension since I don't want to be around them as much and I'm not really honest about that, and this creates additional tension with my partner since they wants to meet them/ doesn't want my friends to think they're taking me away from them. That kinda ends up lasting the whole year and sucks too. I would end up talking to my friends about my feelings and the whole 1st year situation, but that didn't make me feel any better either. My partner and I also end up getting closer, and share the things we worry about individually, and some of those days were heavy too. It was pretty clear she didn't like school either so that made me kinda sad to see her go through that, and I think we had some difficulty initially trying to accept each other's coping strategies or situations. But 2nd year comes and goes. I tried to do only 4 courses a semester this time, and it was still whack. I just felt too stressed to be mentally stimulated or put out my best work, and it seems like everyone else is the same way. I didn't feel like a scholar I felt like a robot, where my interests were unsupported. I felt like the days I decided to skip class and chill at the library and browse I learned more. That made me kinda sad, I liked the idea of college and learning about stuff you're interested in. I was really bored and sad my last 2 years of high school just from how monotonous the material was and how no one seemed to care about anyone and how long the days were, and I was expecting college to be better, not this much worse. I actually really like STEM and stuff but this was so boring, yeah the material was difficult at this school, but I think only because there was so much at once. The lack of free exploration, flexibility, and contextualization just made it so bland.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I decide to to take a gap year and leave school. I thought that would make me feel better but it really hasn't. I didn't really have a plan or the energy to make one, but I knew I had to get out of that place. I go home for a bit with my partner then go to the town where my partner lives where I got a short summer job. The tension between me and my family (they still don't understand why I left and at this point its pissing me off) ends up reflecting back to her a little bit which upsets them and me too, so that also sucked. I stay with them and their family for my summer job. The gig is nice, and my boss there is really cool, so that was good. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was still kinda stressed, cause now I wasn't sure what to do. I didn't want to go back to my current school, but how was I supposed to find a new one? No one I knew who I trusted was having a good time at school, and many were dealing with the same stuff as me. My parents were encouraging me to go to a school a lot like my current one because they get a discount on tuition, but I really don't want to do that. I could also say fuck it for a few years and just work (i have some coding skillz), but I don't really want to stay at home so I would have to find a place to stay and job, which is also stressful. Then i really like my partner and I wouldn't want to do long distance too long, but we talk about it and i think we could manage, but it just sucks i have to separate us for a bit if I'm going to do anything else. (its also sucks I feel like I don't really have someone I can share all of this with, my friends and I are on decent terms now, but I am still trying to distance myself from that school now that I'm gone). 

&amp;#x200B;

I stay at the gig for about 8 weeks then go home again thinking I can relax there and make a decision but oh boy I was wrong. My parents have been fighting about their finances on top of fighting me about my schooling, so that stinks. My partner comes to visit me for their bday, and I ask my parents how long they can stay and get an answer. They end up going back on their word and basically make them so uncomfortable they leave. This makes me really upset, but given our lack of communication between me and my parents I don't even know how to communicate this outrage to them. So I just leave two weeks later, saying I'm visiting them until Halloween, but I don't really want to go home until Xmas out of obligation to my other family members I actually like.

I broke this up into how I feel right now, and some background about my feelings. I make a request in the end of the first part if you're looking to share advice or give support.

&amp;#x200B;

**----------------FEELINGS NOW------------------------**

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling such bad anxiety lately, like the kind that hurts in your chest and throat. I'm currently out of school on a gap year trying to figure out transferring. I don't know about a school I would actually want to go to, and I am constantly looking but can't find one, I even look abroad, and at alternative universities, at different subjects, at cooperative universities. If I were to work for awhile instead, I am constantly looking at gig sites and thinking of stuff I could freelance in and stuff I could sell. Also constantly looking at places I could live for cheap, that maybe my partner would like. Constantly trying to figure out how I could tell my parents how I really feel about school so they could understand. Trying to do this and think of ways I could sustain it and be healthy and not make my stress worse so I dont get head aches. The constant spinning of my brain gears is just fucking eating meeeeee. I talk to my close friends about some of this stuff but it's not helping. I feel so alone in this too, all of my friends are either in school or graduated, and Im not working or consistently volunteering so I'm mostly alone. The anxiety and stress of having to plan my whole life all the time is making me incapable of doing anything that I want to do, or reaching about to people telling them I need help. I feel like I shut myself out from the world since I had such a bad 2 years of HS and 2 years of college, and I want to reach out again, but it's hard. I'm also trying to find a therapist now that I'm out of school, but that's hard and expensive. Everything is hard and expensive. I also want to try to let go of some of these ideas about having to work or go to school just so I can relax for a bit, and figure stuff out, but I cannot!!! I've just been thinking and thinking and making plans I cannot follow through with because my anxiety is sucking the energy out of my body. I wish someone could just take care of me, somewhere I can be social, and do things that I haven't done before, but idk where that is. I've thought about Peace Corps or Americorps or WWOOFing but that's planning I don't want to do, and idk how ethical they are and i don't want to decide, and idk if I can do work. I've thought about just traveling and just taking whatever gigs I could take, but that's more planning I just cannot do right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I want is to be better and not always be spinning out so I can make a decision I'm happy with and move on with my life. I need some help, if you have any advice or encouragement please comment. I know all this planning is going nowhere, and at this point I just want to have a handle on myself and my feelings, so I can make decisions then.

**------------Background--------------------------------------**

I recently took time off from school because of how bad it was. I went to a pretty rigorous STEM college in the US for 2 year and it was terrible. I had to take 5+ classes as a part of the core for my first year, and pretty difficult math and science courses at that, and I pretty soon developed migraines from the stress. I did okay my first semester, and actually above average in my second one, but it was so bad. I'm a PoC and the first person in my family to really go away for college, so there wasn't a lot I was really expecting. I agreed to go to my college because of the importance the placed upon being aware of the effect of your work on the world, but it was pretty clear that they didn't care. Any mention of discussion of the school's affiliation of with projects with harmful impacts or their failure to retain students or statistics about high student stress were met with outrage and confusion from professors, administrators, and certain students alike

&amp;#x200B;

A faculty member even came out saying how they were disappointed by their peers, whom they had overheard thought the college was getting worse since letting in more diverse students. I actually had a personal falling out with the diversity office about their lack of action and was met with lots of aggression, which sucked. I even ended being racially profiled by local PD when my friends and I were trying to blow off steam before finals, and asked for some flexibility due to stress and was denied (that was scary and stupid :/ ). I wrote an anonymous letter lashing out at the diversity office. Between this teacher's confession and other events on campus This eventually lead to some public forums (these were terrible by the way, our school prez is an idiot who doesn't care about us, and so are all the department heads), firings, and staff leavings. Being involved a lot of that stuff was exhausting, not just to me but everyone. That was another terrible part about school, everyone around me was depressed or tired or shut down, it seemed like no one was doing okay, even when I could muster a bit of peace for myself, it seemed like somebody was on the verge of a breakdown. Any-who, 1st semester comes and goes and 2nd semester rolls around, and then things get worse. We end up doing more organizing, but we lose 2 students to suicide (on a very small campus too), which is impacts me deeply. I didnt even know them personally but it felt like I lost 2 friends. We had all done this work to try to get some accountability but it felt like it was all for naught. At this point my stress levels were through the roof with the organizing, course work, and grief. This cause me to do some pretty stupid things romantically too, getting involved with a wishy-washy girl who was already in a relationship, who I continued to pursue in secret from my friends after it came out, which I think just made things much much worse. God I was soooo stressed about that too, and the resulting fights that came from that. Idk it just also sucked too i was doing so well academically while letting go of myself in other areas (getting migraines, having a messy room, messy romantically) no one from home even told me I was doing a good job, they were just so confused about why I was stressing even after I tried to explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, 2nd semester comes and goes with more protests and school work, but eventually its over and I decided to go home and not do an internship. The whole time I'm home I'm just stressed, trying to process all of those feelings but unable to. It shows, I'm not very nice to my family, but not really mean, just more closed off. And I get irritated trying to explain my school situation, I explain what happens and they just have a ""keep trucking on"" attitude which I think is dumb. I just wanted the academic parts without all this drama. I think over the summer I end up becoming more closed off, and while I consider taking leave then, i just go back to school. I met an amazing person from the school who happen to be in my home town over the summer, we end up hanging out a lot and start dating. They're nice, probably the best thing to come out of that whole experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I go back and as a more closed off guy, I don't really try hanging out with my friends who I went through all that stuff with in my first year and elect to hang out with my partner. I'm still stressed at this point, but I have a history of just not communicating things, so I don't really talk to them for awhile. And even when I do it doesn't make me feel better. Guess I'll add I saw the school counselor once a week 2nd semester and all of 2nd year, to help me with my anxiety and just sadness I had during the year. Anyway my friends and I are start having tension since I don't want to be around them as much and I'm not really honest about that, and this creates additional tension with my partner since they wants to meet them/ doesn't want my friends to think they're taking me away from them. That kinda ends up lasting the whole year and sucks too. I would end up talking to my friends about my feelings and the whole 1st year situation, but that didn't make me feel any better either. My partner and I also end up getting closer, and share the things we worry about individually, and some of those days were heavy too. It was pretty clear she didn't like school either so that made me kinda sad to see her go through that, and I think we had some difficulty initially trying to accept each other's coping strategies or situations. But 2nd year comes and goes. I tried to do only 4 courses a semester this time, and it was still whack. I just felt too stressed to be mentally stimulated or put out my best work, and it seems like everyone else is the same way. I didn't feel like a scholar I felt like a robot, where my interests were unsupported. I felt like the days I decided to skip class and chill at the library and browse I learned more. That made me kinda sad, I liked the idea of college and learning about stuff you're interested in. I was really bored and sad my last 2 years of high school just from how monotonous the material was and how no one seemed to care about anyone and how long the days were, and I was expecting college to be better, not this much worse. I actually really like STEM and stuff but this was so boring, yeah the material was difficult at this school, but I think only because there was so much at once. The lack of free exploration, flexibility, and contextualization just made it so bland.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I decide to to take a gap year and leave school. I thought that would make me feel better but it really hasn't. I didn't really have a plan or the energy to make one, but I knew I had to get out of that place. I go home for a bit with my partner then go to the town where my partner lives where I got a short summer job. The tension between me and my family (they still don't understand why I left and at this point its pissing me off) ends up reflecting back to her a little bit which upsets them and me too, so that also sucked. I stay with them and their family for my summer job. The gig is nice, and my boss there is really cool, so that was good. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was still kinda stressed, cause now I wasn't sure what to do. I didn't want to go back to my current school, but how was I supposed to find a new one? No one I knew who I trusted was having a good time at school, and many were dealing with the same stuff as me. My parents were encouraging me to go to a school a lot like my current one because they get a discount on tuition, but I really don't want to do that. I could also say fuck it for a few years and just work (i have some coding skillz), but I don't really want to stay at home so I would have to find a place to stay and job, which is also stressful. Then i really like my partner and I wouldn't want to do long distance too long, but we talk about it and i think we could manage, but it just sucks i have to separate us for a bit if I'm going to do anything else. (its also sucks I feel like I don't really have someone I can share all of this with, my friends and I are on decent terms now, but I am still trying to distance myself from that school now that I'm gone). 

&amp;#x200B;

I stay at the gig for about 8 weeks then go home again thinking I can relax there and make a decision but oh boy I was wrong. My parents have been fighting about their finances on top of fighting me about my schooling, so that stinks. My partner comes to visit me for their bday, and I ask my parents how long they can stay and get an answer. They end up going back on their word and basically make them so uncomfortable they leave. This makes me really upset, but given our lack of communication between me and my parents I don't even know how to communicate this outrage to them. So I just leave two weeks later, saying I'm visiting them until Halloween, but I don't really want to go home until Xmas out of obligation to my other family members I actually like.

2 years ago, I was 130 kgs or so, I started CICO and lost 30 kgs coming down to 98kgs, fueled by rejection. Then I gave in, and regained 22 kgs over the course of my summer break and internship break of about 3 months. 
I tried restarting, but I can't. I give in. Feels hard and frankly, the whole process seems so fucking long. I'm not at a good mental place about it right now I think. Every day is filled with awkward interactions with people, not being confident, being insecure. Physically as well, I feel discomfort all the time, clothes don't fit anymore, got man boobs. But I've started getting used to it, and I do feel about it when I'm not hungry, but once I get hjngry, it all goes to shit. 
Help.

9pj2v7,8,2018-10-19,Happy Friday :),morncuppacoffee,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/9pj2v7/happy_friday/,"What have been your wins this week?
I decided to take a personal day today which I NEVER do.
I am taking my son to an appt then dropping him off at school and taking the rest of the day for self-care. (Normally I would just head into work).
Afternoon yoga class planned!!

In terms of work, I've gotten some good leads for new clients. Have been under tremendous pressure to get our census back up.
I also didn't respond to another email from that woman I was venting about the other day.
After reading the feedback on this sub, I decided I'm only going to deal with her on the phone IF necessary not over emails she is looking to JADE me. (Thanks to my Reddit colleague who shared this great tip).

Had a wonderful discussion yesterday with our clinical team about all the changes in our field over the last decade and how this affects us.  Also my colleague validated that this still doesn't mean I should take on certain cases or go outside of my role just to help someone out to fill a need that doesn't exist. Or get sucked into client or their family drama that's not mine to get involved in ;).

Some new art supplies to use in groups came in the mail last night.

I came across an old gift card I'm not going to use to pay for this, so was a major win!

Oh yeah also randomly heard from an old intern I lost touch with. Had lots of odds stacked against them but they are doing fabulous in the field and are being considered for a position in my company, which is super hard to get into. I was able to provide them with an awesome reference and they will be an amazing resource and networking connection if they get the job.

Overall I'm feeling very supported this week which is a wonderful feeling."
9pjpho,1,2018-10-19,Antwoord op vragen van de leden Bergkamp en Den Boer over een mogelijk incorrect politie voorschrift en de schijnbare willekeur bij het handhaven van een omgangsregeling,kamerstukken-bot,kamerstukken,https://www.reddit.com/r/kamerstukken/comments/9pjpho/antwoord_op_vragen_van_de_leden_bergkamp_en_den/,"^(Vragen van de leden Bergkamp en Den Boer &amp;#40;beiden D66&amp;#41; aan de ministers van Justitie en Veiligheid en voor Rechtsbescherming over een mogelijk incorrect politie voorschrift en de schijnbare willekeur bij het handhaven van een omgangsregeling &amp;#40;ingezonden 29 augustus 2018; 2018Z14960&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het bericht ‘Het is vrijwel altijd de vader die het onderspit delft’?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 1:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het niet nakomen van een omgangsregeling door een ouder traumatische gevolgen kan hebben voor de andere ouder en vooral ook voor het kind c.q. de kinderen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 2:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. Als ouders een zorg- of omgangsregeling hebben opgesteld of als de rechter een regeling heeft vastgesteld, dienen de ouders zich hieraan te houden, primair omwille van het kind. Als dit niet gebeurt, kan dit traumatische gevolgen hebben voor het kind en de andere ouder.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat, in het geval dat beide ouders gezamenlijk gezag hebben het zo is, dat de ene ouder ten opzichte van de andere ouder het misdrijf ""onttrekking ouderlijk gezag"" kan plegen op grond van artikel 279 van het wetboek van strafrecht, indien de omgangsregeling niet wordt nagekomen en dat een beroep op de politie kan worden gedaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 3:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het niet nakomen van een zorg- of omgangsregeling kan het strafbare feit onttrekking aan wettig gezag opleveren, waarvan aangifte kan worden gedaan bij de politie. Een beroep op het strafrecht geldt in dit soort situaties als een ultimum remedium.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het bewust niet nakomen van een door een rechter vastgestelde zorg- of omgangsregeling en het daarmee incidenteel of langdurig onttrekken aan het wettig gezag of uitgeoefende toezicht, is nadrukkelijk opgenomen in de nieuwe richtlijn van het OM voor strafvordering onttrekking minderjarige aan wettig gezag.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat bij handhaving door de politie, op grond van artikel 279 van het wetboek van Strafrecht, voor het niet nakomen van een omgangsregeling er geen onderscheid gemaakt mag worden tussen de verzorgende en de niet-verzorgende ouder, zoals ook de Hoge Raad in een eerdere uitspraak stelt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 4:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, dat klopt. In lijn met de aangehaalde uitspraak van de Hoge Raad geldt dat daar waar een zorg- of omgangsregeling is neergelegd in een rechterlijke uitspraak, de verzorgende ouder – evenals de niet-verzorgende ouder – kan worden verweten de regeling niet na te komen en daarmee artikel 279 van het Wetboek van Strafrecht van toepassing kan zijn.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u bevestigen dat in een intern politievoorschrift over bemiddeling bij omgangsrecht, dat op 5 oktober 2015 in ieder geval nog van kracht was, staat dat wanneer een verzorgende ouder het kind niet meegeeft en dus de omgangsregeling niet nakomt, niet het strafbare feit op grond van artikel 279 van het wetboek van strafrecht pleegt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u voorts bevestigen dat dit interne politievoorschrift op het moment van indiening van deze schriftelijke vragen, 29 augustus 2018, nog steeds van kracht is? Zo nee, tot wanneer was dit interne voorschrift van kracht?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat dit interne voorschrift geen correcte uitleg is van het strafbare feit op grond van artikel 279 van het Wetboek van Strafrecht?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat zijn de consequenties geweest van deze incorrecte interpretatie van de handhavingsmogelijkheden van de politie omtrent het niet nakomen van omgangsregelingen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid dit interne politievoorschrift te wijzigingen zodat de politie haar handhavende rol in het nakomen van omgangsregelingen op een correcte wijze invult? Zo ja, wanneer is deze wijziging gereed? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op de vragen 5, 6, 7, 8 en 10:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Binnen de politie bestaan meerdere richtlijnen die gaan over hoe met &amp;#40;het niet nakomen van&amp;#41; zorg- en omgangsregelingen moet worden omgegaan.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij één van deze voorschriften heb ik moeten constateren  dat een zinsnede was opgenomen, die luidde dat het niet meegeven door de verzorgende ouder niet het strafbare feit oplevert. Dit is onjuist en niet in lijn met artikel 279 van het Wetboek van Strafrecht. Ik betreur dit zeer. Dit voorschrift was op 29 augustus 2018 van kracht.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De genoemde werkinstructie is inmiddels aangepast en intern gecommuniceerd. De gewraakte  zinsnede is verwijderd. Ook biedt de instructie nu meer specifieke handvatten voor agenten om te kunnen handelen in situaties waarbij bemiddeling bij een zorg- of omgangsregeling nodig is.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u van mening dat er sprake is van willekeur in de handhaving van omgangsregeling? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, wat gaat u hieraan doen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 9:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik herken mij niet in het beeld dat sprake zou zijn van willekeur in de handhaving op de zorg- of omgangsregeling door de politie. Uiteraard is het voor strafrechtelijke handhaving noodzakelijk dat politie een strafbaar feit kan vaststellen. In situaties waar gescheiden ouders een andere uitleg hebben van afspraken en de &amp;#40;niet&amp;#41; nakoming daarvan, is zorgvuldig onderzoek vereist. Hierbij kunnen bijvoorbeeld de rechterlijke uitspraken worden opgevraagd om vast te stellen of de verzorgende ouder voldoende medewerking verleent aan de door de rechter in dat specifieke geval opgelegde omgangsregeling.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Als de politie op basis van feitenonderzoek feiten en omstandigheden vindt die een verdenking onderbouwen, wordt overleg gevoerd met het OM. De officier van justitie is immers verantwoordelijk voor de aansturing van de strafrechtelijke handhaving.

It's not like the entire office gathers every day at 12 to eat together and I'm the only one sitting there w/o food being awkward. At my current office, people just eat their lunches whenever they feel like at their desks because we don't have a break room, but my supervisor STILL asks me every day if I brought lunch. Is it because I'm an intern, young, and relatively new to the office? when I worked minimum wage jobs at non-professional places, literally nobody would ever ask me about my food or cared that I didn't eat on my lunch breaks (which are actually scheduled into my shift)

sometimes I bring food just to show people I eat, sometimes I don't just because I'm too lazy to prepare lunch the night before and ever since middle school I'm just in the habit of not eating until I'm at home. I also ECA stack to make myself more social and energetic. for the past 2 weeks, I told them I've been sick and can't eat solid food, so they've chilled out, but I need to start bringing food again. it just seems like such a dumb, personal question... like I'm in college, maybe I don't have money for groceries atm, maybe I have health conditions, maybe I don't like eating in front of people, etc. "

2)You are Madelaine Petsch/Camila Mendes and i am your biggest stalker. I have a job of a makeup artist and have to take the makeup off after the shoot. But after knowing that everybody else has left, i take advantage of the situation 

3)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

4)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

5)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body

9pn5gk,3,2018-10-19,"Bachelor's with little to no lab experience from school currently looking for work, please advise",spurionic,academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/9pn5gk/bachelors_with_little_to_no_lab_experience_from/,"I am a recent graduate from university, B.Sc in Molecular Biology from UC San Diego. My biggest goof is that in the four years that I was there, I never attempted to get experience working in a lab. After completing a short internship at a laboratory at which I learned how to handle mice and grow mammalian cell cultures in an attempt to band-aid remedy that fact, I am now seeking an entry-level position in the bio/biotech and pharma industries. 

Problem is, I feel that I am not competitive because I failed to get actual lab experience as an undergraduate. I've interviewed with a couple hiring managers and they all seemed disappointed when I admitted that all my ""skills"" were from lab courses, not actual work experience. A lot of these interviews were gotten from recruiters, and companies look for contractors that are ready to hit the ground running with minimal training time, especially for contracts &lt; 1 year.

Should I keep pressing on looking for bio industry jobs and hope that a company takes a chance on me as I am? Or, should I seek out additional internships/volunteering to get applicable experience in say: PCR, plasmid isolation, and DNA sequencing? I feel that the latter would help me understand what I want from my career better, but at the same time I feel like I should be getting my life in order already."
9pnz6e,3,2018-10-19,Feeling lost and emotionally exhausted,blackwell94,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9pnz6e/feeling_lost_and_emotionally_exhausted/,"I'm 24, male, and I live in NYC. I have an incredible life, and so much to be thankful for. But I'm also just getting so tired. There's three main issues that I just can't seem to muster up the energy to deal with: my book, my job, and my romantic life. I'll go in order...

I wrote this fantasy novel two years ago (after three years of development) and posted it online. Over 75,000 people have read it so far. It's the first of a trilogy, and while I'm dying to write the second novel, I can't. You're not supposed to write a sequel until the first has been published, as a lot can change. But I can't get the first published. Everyone assured me that getting published would be so easy with my stats. But I get rejection after rejection after rejection, and it's emotionally draining. Now, people are telling me that since I got all those readers in early 2017, the book is already yesterdays news and I missed my window of opportunity. It's the most oppressive feeling of disappointment that I've ever felt. Realizing that it's almost 2019 makes me want to cry. I absolutely thought I would have gotten a publishing deal by now. Publishing is always a slow and brutal process, and I should stick it out, but MAN it sucks to get constant rejection emails and to not be able to move forward with this.

As for my job, I started as an intern at a major film/TV network right after graduation. I've stayed on the same team for two years now, and I've gotten two promotions. I was so happy with everything and thought I was ahead of the curve, but we got a new associate producer who is exactly my age and makes twice what I make. I made $15 an hour until I finally asked for a raise, and they gave me $20, even though I said my absolute minimum was $25. As I'm working in TV production, we have no benefits whatsoever, so $20 an hour (in Manhattan, no less) isn't even remotely a living wage. When I spoke to my boss about it, she basically said that I was lucky to be making 20 and it was a competitive rate. I can see now that I simply need to leave, as my boss will always see me as her intern. Between completing major projects for her, she'll ask me to get her lunch or drop something off for her, which constantly makes me feel like a loser. I know I have to leave, but I'm terrified of getting a new job. 99.99% of the jobs I want are in LA, but I really want to stay in NYC and avoid uprooting my entire life. And getting a job in my industry in general is almost impossible. I have a LOT to figure out on that front, but every time I try to think about it, I want to run screaming in the opposite direction.

Finally, I broke up with my boyfriend after a year of dating in February. I'm over him now, and I'm dating someone new (it's only been a month), and we both really like one another...but I'm finding it so hard to move slowly. All of my friends have serious boyfriends, and I hate going to all of these social events alone because my guy is off with his friends. I understand that we haven't been dating for very long, and he's an independent person...but I desperately miss the feeling of having a companion, having someone who is there for me no matter what. Yesterday I had an endoscopy (no big deal, but I went under anesthesia and stuff), and I was told I'd need someone to pick me up and take me home after. When I asked my guy, he sounded like he really didn't want to do it, and said his day was super busy. He works at a very, very chill startup and I have a hard time imagining that he couldn't leave for a few minutes to walk me out of the hospital (which is near his office). When I asked another friend, he dropped everything and came a long distance to help me out. And after the procedure, my guy didn't even call me to see how I was doing/feeling. He didn't even respond to my texts until like 11pm that night. Again, I know I'm moving too fast and expecting too much, but I just miss having someone always be there to support me.

Yikes, sorry about this massive pity-party. Just in the dumps. I feel like if just one of these three things went well, I could cope with the other two. There's still time for the relationship to develop and to get a book deal...I just have to keep chugging away. \*sigh\*

I'll be fine."
9po5bl,12,2018-10-19,Happy,br_aspon,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/9po5bl/happy/,"The last time I smoked was over 4 years ago on  September 3, 2014. Before I  was on and off with attempting to quit since 2011. Between 2011 and 2014  I made it to 30 days 4x then relapsed. 60 days 2x then relapsed. 87 days then relapsed. 

Then on September 4, 2014 my ex-fiance, myself and friend from massage school were hanging out getting ready to smoke when I just had this simple thought of what my life would be like if I really did quit smoking for good. It was my turn and I just said no and passed it along.

When I smoked it was same shit different day with some drama and sketchiness mixed in. A lot of talk and no action from yourself or whoever you associated with. Life being no better off than it was a year ago. Being broke all the time and on govt. bennies. I used  to smoke before everything. Good things like nature walks, reading, writing, school, cooking, listening to music, watching movies, bonfires and bbqs, yoga, giving massages, cleaning, organizing etc. Bad things like a PTSD flashback, severe OCD, crippeling anxiety, excuses like I'm actually more productive, it helps me sleep, etc etc. 

Truth is, I just needed to deal with the negative head on. I didn't need pot to make me function I just needed therapy/ support groups, self care and applying boundaries and coping skills to my life. Anytime you start something new it's hard and it sucks but it gets better especially when you are working towards bettering your life. 

Because I quit smoking I made many life changes; I strived to meet certain goals. Some were unexpected, some were necessary, some were small, some were so far out there I didn't think they would ever be possible. I reached my academic goal graduating from massage school on time with good grades then going back to school for aesthetics and graduating on time, as a student leader with good grades. I created a fulfilling  career for myself. I met my professional goals very quickly working my way up from student intern at an organic day spa to working at a Forbes 5 star spa. I broke up with my ex-fiance who I was with since HS who didn't want to do anything with his life. I brought my credit score up to an A+ rating, I made new friends, I moved out on my own into a nice place I could afford no roommates. I conquered my fears.  I bought a brand new car. I got off of all government assistance. I traveled, I flew on a plane. I went on dates. I got engaged. I got married. I had a baby.  

I am just ONE more payment away from paying off my $20k student loan debt. Then I can add that to my list of accomplished goals.

The more goals I meet the farther away I get from being the codependent lonely basket case stoner I used to be. At first I purposely did the exact opposite of what I would have done when I smoked. It got me far now I am creating new goals and adjusting old ones. Everyday is an adventure and everyday I am grateful.

Maybe I'm someone high class getting fucked in such a trashy way, or I'm hiding from an even worse situation. As far as exactly how this goes, I have a few ideas. I am open to new ones too. Some of my ideas get pretty weird, so read further at your own risk

My kinks include: non-con, rough, degradation, humiliation, animals, monster, differences (age, weight, class, etc.)

My main limits are: scat, torture, underage women and vore.

**I am always open! Even if you are reading this on the front page!** Quality messages are so much more important then being the first one to message me! I promise! For those who read all of this, thank you so much :3

I hope to get your messages!

1. Going about my business I find myself being forcibly being bent over by someone or something nasty. While I'm sure who ever finds me would help, the world would find out, and it would ruin my image. For this I'd be playing a celeb, or just someone with a following. Who exactly I'm playing as is up to you.

2. Being chased by armed guards in a jungle while I hold a valuable treasure is just another Wednesday. But this time I'm dangerously close to being caught, they are all around me. That just so happens to be when a vine/snake wraps its way around my leg. For this I was thinking of playing as a [Lara Croft](https://i.imgur.com/XaMD0Lx.jpg) type, but I'll leave it up to you

3. I'm a conservative woman who finds herself being pinned down by another woman/futa. I hate this so much, but the shame is too great for me to risk anyone seeing me. I was thinking I could either be a younger college girl being fucked someone much older than me, or a milfy ceo getting her blazer torn by a young intern seeking revenge.

4. The day of my wedding, I'm all dressed up for my big day. I can barely move in this tight dress. My soon to be husband is very religious though, if he finds out I was raped he might leave me."

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

9pq5vz,13,2018-10-19,Tragedy,Cinemus_Prime,berserklejerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/berserklejerk/comments/9pq5vz/tragedy/,"Those active in the chat will know about my history with Kentaro Miura, but those out of the loop, here's the rundown.

On a trip to Japan, my pregnant mother made a deal with Miura to get a decent Berserk anime made. The price would be her unborn son. When I was born, Miura was in the hospital waiting room, ready to take me home. My parents consoled themselves with the fact that a good anime was finally happening, but unfortunately, Miura had only just finished the Golden age, so that's all that was adapted.

The year was 1997

From there, I was raised to be his sex slave, taught from the moment I could walk how best to pleasure a man. I was passed around to Miura's friends and associates, and often used as a bargaining chip to sweeten various deals. I had sex with so many Japanese businessmen in that time.

The only man who didn't take advantage of me was Yoshiyuki Okamura. You may know him as Buronson, author of Hokuto No Ken. I always called him Uncle Buronson. He never once treated me like an object, like the toy I'd been raised to be. He treated me like a person, like someone who mattered. Like family.

I'd spend the weekends at his house, watching Mad Max movies over and over and over again. That's actually how I learned to speak English. It was also during this time that I discovered the internet, and by extension, the outside world.

Over the years, I mastered the art of mid-coital pick pocketing and would use stolen phones to access the internet and share my story with the rest of the world. But then one day, when I was sitting in the broom closet of Studio Gaga after getting plowed by Shigeru Matzuzaki's 18 incher in order to secure him as the star of the upcoming Berserk movie, I realized I'd made a terrible mistake in stealing his phone.

And so I slipped it back to him during round two, and then to make sure I didn't lose contact with the world at large, I seduced the cute intern and stole his phone instead. Unfortunately, after my rounds with Matzuzaki's tree trunk of a schlong, my asshole was too loose to hold it in. I was quickly discovered and the intern was punished for fucking me without ass privileges.

When I was brought home, I was chained to the radiator and forced to wear a super cute bell collar to make sure I didn't try anything. This continued until the next weekend when I went back to Buronson's for yet another two nights of Mad Max Marathons.

When he brought me back to Miura's on Sunday night, he walked me to the door and made sure Miura saw him give me a brand new phone. When I went back inside, I found the Intern chained up in my spot by the radiator, bell collar and all. His ass was red, and his spirit was broken.

Miura let me do as I pleased after that, but he was clearly brimming with rage. He stopped drawing Berserk and started on a new Space Yaoi Hentai starring a twinkalicious catboi who looked eerily like the Intern. There was another catboi who looked like me, but whenever he showed up, the Intern's Catboi would violently fuck mine to death in full color panels. 

Miura forced me to read them all, and then burned them when I was finished, saying they'd reached their audience.

One day, he got violently drunk and threw a full bottle of whiskey at the radiator. It shattered and soaked the burning hot implement with highly flamable alcohol, while the catatonic Intern simply lay were he was and waited for the fires to reach him.

After I used Miura's bedding to smother the flames, he locked me in his own broomcloset and threatened to do far worse than burn me in the morning. I used my phone to call Uncle Buronson, asking for help.

When he arrived, Miura had passed out, and so he took me and the Intern far away from that place.

For the last two days we've been holed up in Buronson's house fearful for our lives as Matzuzaki tried again and again to batter down the barricaded doors.

Uncle Buronson even gave me a gun, and told me to keep the Intern safe. I promised him I would do that. I don't know if the Intern could hear me then, but I promised him too. And I meant it.... I swear to God, I meant it.

Now, though, I'm sorry to say, I failed to keep that promise.

The fighting is over, and so is my life of sex slavery to Miura. All it cost was one innocent life. The life of a beautiful boy no older than myself who's name I never knew, even though I'm the one who dragged him into all of this... and for what? So I could use his phone for an hour.

When we saw what had happened, Miura, Matzuzaki, Buronson and I all stopped and stared in awe at the body, a single bullet hole in his head, and a smoking gun slipping from Miura's trembling hand.

Matzuzaki started to leave, and when Miura tried to stop him, he turned around.

""This,"" he said, ""was never in our contract.""

And with that he walked away into the night.

While Buronson knelt beside the Intern's body I faced Miura. ""What was his name?"" I asked, ""He worked for you, you bastard! What was his name!""

Kentaro Miura, author of Berserk, did not know the name of the young intern he had just killed.

We stayed there for some time, all holding our poses like statues in the night while we waited for the police to arrive.

Nobody said a word during the investigations. In his shame, Miura chose not to pin it all on me and Buronson, though he very well could have. Instead it was inconclusive. If it weren't for the chief investigator's enduring love of Berserk and Hokuto No Ken, they might both have been arrested and charged with murder. Unfortunately, he wasn't as big a fan of anything I'd done. Still, though, he was willing to offer me my freedom in exchange for one quick screw.

He already had enough of a bulge to be impressive, and it was clear this wasn't the first time he'd made such an offer before. It wouldn't be the first time my body was used as a bargaining chip either.

I told him not to touch me.

If Buronson hadn't stepped in on my behalf then, I would most certainly be on trial for murder. Still, though, I don't think that man will ever let me get away with anything else again.

With that in mind, Uncle Buronson and I agreed that it might be best for me to leave Japan altogether. He arranged a flight for me, and even set me up with some American friends of his on the west coast.

He made me promise to keep in touch... and that's what I plan to do.

I'll never forget you, Uncle Buronson. You were the one who taught me to be more than just a toy for the amusement of others. You taught me to be brave like Mel Gibson, (and also Tom Hardy that one time.) You taught me that I was a human being capable of so much more than what I was supposedly born to do.

Thank you. And thanks to everyone in the chat who's followed me on this harrowing and heartfelt journey from the very beginning.

The only thing left to say is this.

I'm still gonna keep up with Berserk. That shit's fucking hot."

(Rough Idea),Soupandsaladbarfan,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9pqsoo/m4f_the_intern_affair_rough_idea/,"I would love to play out a scene where you are an intern at my company; its not a well paying job, but its in the field you want so you take what you can get. Despite the low pay, you always seem to be dressed better then the other interns and you are open about not coming from money. During your nights you make the vast majority of your money as an escort, its not something you are proud of, but you have your fun and your clients treat you well. 

I would be rich, married and the last person that anyone would expect to cheat on their wife. You've met her a few times as shes come to the office and you've seen how we interact as she perfectly placed by my side. You do have a bit of a crush on me as you do like older men, but push it aside to remain professional.

The scene would start with your arrival at a room for a new client, which of course be me. Would love to explore your submission to not only a client you are attracted to, but to your boss that could ruin your job and to a potential sugar daddy if you are worth what the escort company charges. 

I wouldnt know who I was getting until I open the door so it would be a surprise to us both. But if you are willing we can explore my marriage and how you would fit in after our initial night together.

My name is Scott and I'm 42. I'm about 6'5 and 225 pound with reddish brown hair with bits of grey. I'm in pretty good shape and you can tell as you've seen how my clothes cling to my body. I've got a bit of chest hair and hair on my abs along with a thick 8 inch cock.

Kinks: Anal, creampies, cock worship, cheating, passionate blowjobs, desire, rough and intense sex, public play, shower sex, voice play (if you are willing)"

9pqv41,1,2018-10-19,21M and never had a GF - but am I on the right path?,pennygiver,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9pqv41/21m_and_never_had_a_gf_but_am_i_on_the_right_path/,"New account because some of my friends know my regular account.

All my life, I \[21M\] have never been in a relationship, kissed, or received clear romantic interest from a woman. I know I'd be better off if I didn't let it bother me. But I can't help but think about what's wrong with me. Not a week goes by without this worry crushing my mood.

For most of my life, I was a loner. Avoided social interaction in elementary and high because of fear of bullying, and my social incompetence. Got stellar grades, partially due to having nothing better to do. I slowly got better at socializing in college. I met friends from classes, summer internships, and church. I am in engineering so my class and internships don't have many girls in them. Don't have any hobbies. Got better at talking to people, including girls as some of my friends are female. Parties, bars, and clubs aren't my scene - I have done those things with friends but I suck at meeting new people there.

I occasionally asked out girls, about 10, but only ever got rejections. I don't think I had unreasonable standards. One girl I asked out was obese, and most of those girls were the nerdy kind. When I didn't say that it was a date I managed to hang out with girls sometimes, but they'd never be interested in becoming romantic down the line. I stop trying after the rejection and move on. But new rejections hurt deeply because it's not about my feelings for a particular girl, it hurts because it makes me fear that l'll never find anyone. Tried online dating but only ever got one date from it, and it using it hurts so much that I stopped myself from doing it any further. As of now I'm no longer trying to date, as in a few months I'll be moving 9 hours east to a large city in the Northeast for a full-time job.

On paper, I am successful. I'll soon be in a 9-5 job paying 100k/year, and I already have no student debt. Still, it all seems meaningless if I never find love. I am deeply afraid that I'll be alone forever. I'm not ugly, and I'm 5'9 and 165 lbs so a normal build for a guy. There should be a lot going for me. None of my friends or family can even fathom that I'll never find a partner. But if that's true, why have I made no progress on that all my life when almost everyone else I know has? It's hard find support for my feelings. I think it's wrong to re-tell my family/friends/therapist about it every time I break down in private - there is no new information to give them and I'd just be burdening them.

I have lurked on this forum (and other dating advice sources) for some time now. And I'm trying to do something about it. Wanting to find a partner is the main reason why I've been pushing my comfort zone in social situations, and it's the main reason I started going to the gym this year. I believe that's made me more attractive, but I still suck at getting dates. So maybe I have a lot further to go before I'm considered dateable.

Ultimately, I don't want to lonely any more. I've accepted that I may never have a normal dating life. But I only need to succeed once. As I get married and have a kid, the loneliness I felt in my youth won't matter anymore. In those rare times that I got a first date (or something close to it), my mind skips to imagining us marrying, reflecting my hope that this is the time that I'll no longer be lonely. It's not a healthy mindset, and I try to hide these thoughts from others. But it's truly how I feel.

If my dating life doesn't improve soon, by the time I'm 25 I'll be at a point in life where I'm able to live independently and be financially stable, but still never had someone to share my life and heart with. At that point I think I'll go around expressly looking for a marriage partner in churches or a serious dating site like eHarmony. Until then I'll just keep trying to improve my life gradually. Keep working out, try to get a hobby, be less socially awkward, etc and see where it goes."

&gt;Wait. Bailey's husband is a fireman? Wasn't he a doctor?! Guys what the fuck are you doing?

&gt;Hey! My man! Where have you been?! The children are getting completely out of hand! They left Karev in charge of all the children. *Where have you been?!* (I didn't realize he liked Webber so much)

Aaaaaand he found out Derek died. ""It seems like Meredith Grey's pretty dead too at this point, just on the inside.""

&gt;But seriously who left Karev in charge?

&gt;Who is that? What the fuck are they talking about?! They just randomly start talking about some pregnant Teddy?

**Final thoughts about the show after this episode:**
&gt;It's impossible for them for explain, within the world of Seattle Grace, Meredith's actual dynamic at this point. Which is driven obviously by the enormous Hollywood paycheck she's getting for sticking with the series after all this time. She seems pretty over it. I can see why they need to inject new interns or whatever. The show started off tapping into a certain kind of youthful exuberance and it's hard to say... You know what they do keep doing really well? And Bailey gets the most credit overall, but they're still doing the medical drama bit. And Karev is the only part of MAGIC that still is into it. 

&gt;That's right! Owen was dating Cristina. Wait a second. Karev was like... Good still. I just feel sad for him. He seems really lonely. Meredith Grey's did a good job dumping the guy on the date. Dumping that guy and being completely jaded and over everything was the one note she hit perfectly. Everything else was just awkward. 

&gt;The thing with the teenage daughter was coming from a good place but it made me just cry with laughter over how easy they made that look. 

&gt;The green screen helicopter roof scene! I'm pretty sure that would have been a real rooftop in season one or two.  

&gt;IlDreamy needs to get his story sttaight. I'm sure there's a backstory about why he has no accent but his sister does, but he seems shady. He does kinda remind me of season one Derek in that he's just like ""what? I'm just an easy-going attractive dude!"" 

&gt;I think Karev won the hospital in a bet or this is an alternative universe in which Karev is chief and the Chief is a figment of his imagination who follows him around and tries to give him good advice. That also explains why Owen got demoted to paramedic and that one guy is a firefighter now!"
9prdbk,1,2018-10-20,How Important Is One's GPA within the Admissions Process?,Axiomaticuncertainty,cmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/9prdbk/how_important_is_ones_gpa_within_the_admissions/,"Hello, all. As I write this, I'm currently a senior in high school and planning to ED w/ CMU. To give some context, my GPA is a 3.4UW and 3.6W, including freshman yr and 7th/8th. According to the assistant director of admissions, they do not use any grades before sophomore year throughout their decisions; this is good due to my having a 3.5UW and 4.0W, without those earlier years.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here are some of my stats. Please note that, additionally, I did skip my sophomore year of HS and am, by no means, a conventional student.

&amp;#x200B;

GPA - 3.4UW, 3.6W

ACT - 33 (35M, 35R, 31E, 32S)

SAT - 1500 (790M, 710C/R) -- superscore = 1530 (790M, 740C/R)

Subject tests - math 2 = 800, physics = 740, US history = 600 (will not send) &lt;-- should I send physics, at all?

&amp;#x200B;

APs: Physics 1 and C, Calc AB and BC, US History, Euro History, Government, Statistics, Biology, Literature, and Computer Science -- as an FYI, my school on offers 7 of these. I took the rest online via Northwestern's CTD. (phys C, calc BC, CS, Euro)

&amp;#x200B;

I have some ECs, but I come from a small city whose primary industry is tourism. I've tried to find opportunities in the region; however, the best things that I could find were a volunteer position teaching my own classes on programming and ML at our local library and an internship at a private defense/weapons contracting company. (starting in 2 months) Additionally, I do occasional videos on programming which I tend to post on my channel, when time allows.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to go to CMU in order to study AI or CS; I just don't think that I have any chance. Are my suspicions/doubts accurate? It's currently my only big reach, so I'm open to any feedback. (after all, I already feel as if my chances are negligible and communities like College Confidential only serve to worsen things)"

I used one 150 micrograms tab in a 30ml bottle of vodka. Used a dropper to measure out 1ml and hopefully getting 5 micrograms every ml. I've been using the one day on and two days off frequency.

I've noticed more energy, grit , focus , and whole lot less anxiety.

Less anxiety is probably the biggest change I've seen in myself. I always felt something constricting my throat , especially when I was anxious and now that is gone. I've gone from mild to high anxiety to low or none anxiety.

I've had a huge week as well , I received multiple interviews for summer internships. I've never worked at a technical company and I have a shit resume and gpa , I never thought I would be able to get this far. 

MD was a huge part in this as I went to multiple info sessions and the career fair where I spoke to recruiters without fear. 

I originally MD to help me become more passionate in my schoolwork and preparing for interviews, but I only noticed more productivity if I actually am interested in my work. If I don't like what I'm doing , I'll slack off. 

I don't think MD gave me a placebo effect , I Definitely think it helped me for the better. The only side effect was the first night of MD , where I could not fall asleep due to my mind running wild. But that was over quick when I just told myself to go to sleep.

Overall it's been great and will continue to MD.

There’s this kid who is obviously passionate about electronic. We talk a lot in the workshop, basically just me explain programming concept to him and he explaining to me his passion in electronic. Let’s call him Sebastian. 

And then there’s this kid who has autism. First day in the workshop, his mom has to sit beside him. The next time he came, he sat alone and looking a bit shy. His father came in to ask him how he is feeling and I (at this time did not he has autism, thought he was a bit shy) offer to sit next to him. I tried to open him up, asking him about his family, his pet, and electronic. And holy crap was the kid smart. He is smart, he is knowledgeable. The kid understands basic electronics, and obviously has this drive to learn more (he kept telling me how he was dissemble electronic trash near his house and learn more about them). Oh for reference, he was 10. Let’s call him Blake.

This week, I sat next to Blake again, and I normally sit next to Sebastian. Seeing that, Sebastian immediately move his laptop next to Blake. Happy moment number 1.

Sebastian doing his thing again, he started by saying how cool this calculator he made is, and how it was using solar energy. Blake heard that and softly comment on it, and then the 2 kids starting to talk more and more together about electronic. Sitting in between, I can see Blake slowly open himself up, he was smiling, laughing, exciting with his newly met friend. The whole thing was beautiful, I almost cry in the class. I enjoy it so much that at this point they pretty much ignored the current project at the workshop and just passionately talk to each other, I still wouldn’t tell them to focus.

At the end of the day, I really want to go and tell Blake’s grandma (who is the one just told me about Blake’s condition when she took him to the workshop) how good he was today and about the new friend he has made. But I end up did not manage to talk to her since I was busy talking to Sebastian‘s dad about the upcoming event hosted by the university where all final year students get the chance to display their projects.

When I first sign up for volunteering, it was because I need an internship. I just got an accept email from the university about a position to be an research assistant and was thinking about quitting this current volunteer work. The whole moment between Blake and Sebastian changed my mind. Now I can’t wait to see Blake’s parent next week to talk with them about today."

But if I tell them that I am a more support style or go through the motion worker that will do what is asked but will not see the things to its entirety and instead do what I can even if I am an intern or fresh grads, I will be met with that hostile reaction or it will give a very bad impression. As a low level worker it is normal for one to be tag alongside a higher up that has certain quantity of experience and also even though they are doing things in this style they are still helping out the company and working for 8hrs like people but no one like it. 

I can also mention other about non work stuffs but this should be sufficient to illustrate my point here. So I am thinking why is this a bad thing even in non serious settings?"

9ptyqt,0,2018-10-20,I (23F) broke up with my boyfriend (25M) today after being together for 6 years and I don't know how to handle it all,michmichmich95,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ptyqt/i_23f_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_25m_today_after/,"Guys, this story is going to be very long, plus i'm not a native English speaker, please mind any spelling mistakes.

I broke up with my boyfriend today. We have been together since I was 16 years and he was 18 years. We met trough a mutal friend at a concert where this mutal friend was in the band. He was everything I like in a boy, handsome, shy and not chasing after girls. We got in a relationship very fast after we met (I believe about one or two weeks after). I was still in high school and he was doing some sort of pre education to be a marine. He eventually got a injury so had to stop his education and study for security. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 18 years old I moved out of the house to a place about 4 hours away (by train) from home to study. In the weekends I would travel home to see my family and my boyfriend because I missed them a lot. This meant that I didn't have any time to make friends there because I wasn't around in the weekends and as soon as we were done with classes (sometimes we also had only classes till wednesday) I would immediately travel home. This resulted in me not being happy there because my heart was not at it. The same goes when I did both my internships in Amsterdam. It was always a dream of mine but I just didn't feel like I connected there with the people or the city. Obviously this isn't my boyfriends fault because I chose this myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, this year I graduated and for me it felt like it was time to move in together. At that point we had been together for 6 years and I was 22 and he 24, so I felt like this would be very normal. Plus I also really wanted this because I never had a good situation at home and I also didn't wanted to have a place for myself because I had been living on myself for 3 years and it felt very lonely. He didn't really wanted to leave home and we had a lot of fights about it before I convinced him to move in together. This was really something that had upset me because I couldn't understand why he didn't wanted to live with me after being together so long and being this age. Finally we move in together in april this year but it has been very hard on my. I can't find a job in this part of the country, i don't know what else to do, my relationship has never been great and I also don't love the place where we live. Yesterday I decided together with my boss (just a part time job in a retail store so I can earn some money) that I don't really belong there and I had a good talk with her (she is very nice) and talked about my situation where I'm really unhappy in my live at this point. She said that she could feel this about me and that was also the cause of me leaving this job. This made me realize that I really need to change something in my live because I'm very unhappy. So i decided to tell my boyfriend this morning that we need to split up. He didn't take it very well, although he agrees that we have a lot of issues he thinks I'm being to extreme.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing with my boyfriend is, that I love him so much and I really wish I could make it work with him and I have been trying so many years now but the same things keep coming up. He has been going for his drivers license since I met him, so almost 7 years now. While I have my drivers license since I was 18. He has dental braces since he was 16 year, so almost 8 years now. And he does nothing about them, he knows it's a big issue for me and we have had a lot of fights about it but he never does anything to change it. He only promises me things he is never going to follow up on. I can never count on him to do stuff in our appartement. I'm always the one to do the groceries and make sure there is food in the house, he never cleans (only if i ask him and i always get a crumpy reponse, plus he forgets to do it sometimes), and he only does his laundry when he doesn't have any underwear or things like that anymore. I have a lot of bullet points what bothers me about him, plus also a lot of good reasons why this relationship hasn't been working for couple years now. I've tried to break up with him multiple times before but he always convinces me to stay with him, by saying he is going to change and work on stuff. He never does but I just love him and I also want it to work with him.

&amp;#x200B;

We also have a very bad relationship in the bedroom. We only sleep together once a half year or sometimes more because i don't feel anything down there for him. Although I do think he is very good looking I just don't feel aroused by him. This also happend because a lot of reasons and I felt like this is normal when you are together for such a long period. But it is a big problem in our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I've come to this point now that I realize that we really need to break up because it's never going to change and it makes me so unhappy. I just don't know how to go on from here. I think it's the hardest thing that i have ever done in my life and i also just feel lost. I don't know what to do from this point on and I also think he will try to convince me to stay and i'm just afraid that I can't stick trough with it. It's also a part of me that wants to stay because it is just the easiest thing to do because my life is going to change so much when I go trough with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Do any of you have advise how i need to go on with my life? I just feel very lost and unhappy and don't know what I should do.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr i broke up with my boyfriend who i love very much and now I feel very lost and heartbroken. Don't know how to go on with life right now.

9pu9l7,1,2018-10-20,Meri Mast Bhanji Mastani,it_roll,mastram,https://www.reddit.com/r/mastram/comments/9pu9l7/meri_mast_bhanji_mastani/,"Mera naam hai Mayur Teli. Mein do saal se Dallas, Texas men medical practice kar raha hun. Mein 32 saal ka hatta katta javan hun. Heightt 5’8”, weight 160 lbs. Color fair,baal aur aankhen kale. Lund 8” lamba aur dhai inch mota, uncircumcised. Hobbies: physical fitness, sports aur kamashastra. Meri patni mere sath hai. Us ke aagrah par mein mera ye anubhav aap ko suna raha hun.

India men mera gaanv taluka town hai, abadi kuchh 50 hajar ki. Pitaji prakhyaat vakil the. Office men pandrah employees kam karate the. Kahate hein ki pitaji bade chudakkad bhi the. Ghar kam vali sab naukaraniyan, office ki secretaries, gaanv ki naamchin chulbuli auraten, in sab ki chut men pitaji ka lund kam se kam ek visit maar gaya tha. Meri ma us ki dusari patni thi. Pahali patni ko aath bachche hue jin men se do hi jinda rahe: sab se badi Kanchan aur un se do saal chhota bhai Vimal. Meri ma bhi aath baar pregnant hui, in men se tin bache. Mein sab se chhota hun kyun ki mere janm ke baad pitaji ne nas bandi karava li thi.

Kanchan mere se das saal badi hai. Us ke pati Natvarlal Baroda men auto parts ke bade vyopari hai. City bahar un ka chhe bedroom vala bada bungalow hai. Pitaji aur jiju ko achchhi nahin banati; karan muze Kanchan ne bataya lekin barason baad. Kanchan ki shadi ke vakt mein saat saal ka tha. Shadi ke pahale baras Kanchan ko ek bachchi hui jis ka naam rakkha gaya Mastani. Aath sal ki umar men mein mamu ban gaya.

Mastani bahut pyari ladaki thi. Mere se un ki achchhi banati thi. Mere saath khul kar khelati thi aur mein use achchhi kahaniyan sunata tha. Vo bachpan se hi muze “Mamu, tu” kah ke bulati thi. Us ki sab se badi telent thi sketches. Paanch sal ki umar se us ne jo sketches banaye in men se kayi inam jit laaye. Jiju ne makan ke upar vale majale men ek alag kamara Mastani ko de rakkha tha jise vo apana sutdio kahati thi aur jahan vo sketches banati thi. Mere siva kisi ko studio men jane ki paravanagi nahin thi. Mastani aksar apane pictures muze dikhati thi aur mein alochana bhi karata tha.

Mein jab Medical College men bharati hua tab unnis sal ka tha aur Mastani gyarah ki. Us ke badan par javani ke nishan dikhane shuru ho gaye the. Sine par nimbu size ke nokdar stan ubhar aaye the aur mahvari shuru ho gayi thi. Pahale jo hath paanv diyasali jaise patale the vo ab bhar ne lage the. Nitamb bade aur chaude ho ne lage the. Pahale jo pyari lagati thi vo ab jyada pyari lagati thi. Lekin abhi vo thi to bachchi hi.

Muze Medical College men admission to mila lekin hostel men jagah na mili. Jiju aur didi ne aagrah rakkha ki mein un ke saath rahun. Muze majale par ek alag kamara bhi diya gaya. Sab khush hue lekin sab se jyada Mastani kush hui.

Paanch saal bit gaye. Mein Medical College ke last year men aa gaya tha aur 24 sal ka ho gaya tha. Mastani 17 sal ki ho gayi thi. Us ke badan par javani chadh chuki thi. Badan gol aur chikana ho gaya tha. Bade grape fruit ki size ke stan ab bra men bhi chipaye nahin ja sakate the. Nitamb bhari aur chaude ban gaye the. Jab vo chalati thi tab nitamb aur stanon me jo tharrahat hoti thi vo kisi namard ke lund ko jagane ke liye kabil thi. In sab ke bavajud dil se to Mastani bachchi hi thi. Ham dono milate julate the, masti majak karate the aur kabhi kabhi chhed chhad bhi kar lete the. Muze vo pyaari lagati thi, meri bhanji jo thi. Didi aur jiju ko bhi vishvas tha ki mere sath Mastani salamat thi.

Mein kasam se kahata hun ki Mastani ko chodane ka koi plan meine banaya nahin tha. Aisa bhi nahin hai ki mein us ke mast javan jism se andha tha. Kai bar man hi man men kosata tha ki mein kahan us ka mamu bana, air gair hota to us se shadi kar sakata aur ji chahe tab chod sakata. Kaun nasibdaar hoga jo is kachchi kali ko chod ke phool banayega. Mastani to maasum thi, mere dimaag ke vichar se anjan thi. Isi liye vo mere sath chhut se baartav karati thi jab ki muze apani jat par kaabu rakhana padata tha. Kai baar aisa hua ki masti majak men nicker se dhaki us ki bhos dikhai di, ya to jaanghen nangi ho gayi, ya to stan dikhai diya. Aise mauke par mein itana excite ho jata tha ki kam se kam do baar muth maarani padati thi. Kayi raton ko meine us ko chodane ke sapane dekhe lekin ye sapane hi rahe, mein kuchh kar nahin paya.

Aise mahol men ek din……. Ek din mere sapane hakikat ban gaye. Barasat ke din the. Jiju aur didi gadi le kar kahin gaye the. College se mein ghar aaya tab Mastani akeli thi. Gabhrayi hui vo boli, “Mamu, pitaji ka phon aaya tha. Vo Surat gaye hue hein aur vahan bhari barasat ho rahi hai. Shayad raaste bhi band hai. Isi liye vo ruk gaye hein aur kal ya parason aayenge.” Meine use ashvasan diya aur kaha ki fikar karane jaisi koi baat nahin hai. Raat ko yahan bhi badal chha gaye aur halaki barish shuru hui. Kuchh saade das gyarah baje honge. Ghar men ek buddhi nakarani thi jo so gayi thi. Mein padhai men mashgul tha. Aise men Mastani apana latest sketch liye mere kamare men chali aayi.

Dur table par sketch rakh kar vo meri bagal men aa khadi ho gayi aur boli, “Mamu,ye pictrure ke bare men kisi ko batana mat. Tum dekho aur kaho kaisa hai. Koi change karana jaruri hai?” Sab se pahale to us ke badan se aati khushbu se mera man bhar gaya tha. Dusare, vo apana ek haath mere kandhe par rakkhe aise khadi thi ki us ka stan meri pith saath dab gaya tha. Mere soye hue vo ko jagane ke liye itana kafi tha. Dikkat ye thi ki meine pajama ke andar nicker pahani nahin thi. Pajama ka tent ban jaay is se pahale mein kursi men beith gaya. Picture vakai sundar tha. Ek navjavan kashti men khada pani men jaal dal raha tha. Us ka pose, badan ka ek ek muscle, nadiya ka pani, dur dur ke parbat ye sab bahut achchhi tarah draw kiye hue the. Ek chhoti si galati thi. “Kya galati hai ?” Mastani ne puchha. “Yahan, ye jo…jo hai vo aisa sapat nahin hota. Ye to mard hai, is ka… to… kya kahun?” Baat ye thi ki javan ke badan par nicker banayi thi Mastani ne. Lekin aurat jaisi sapat draw ki thi. Bhari loda aur vrushan se bhari hui mard ki nicker nahin thi vo. “Bolo na. Kaisa hona chahiye ?” “Mard ki nicker bhari hui hoti hai, sapat nahin. Jaise tumari bra bhari hoti hai vaise.” “Vo to meine kabhi dekhi nahin hai, Kaise draw karungi ?” Nirash ho kar vo boli. Mere dimag men shaitan aur jaanghon bich loda, dono jagane lage. “Er…mein dikhaun, tuze etaraj na ho to.” Vo khush hokar taliyan baja ne lagi aur boli, “Han,han, tum bhi javan mard ho aur nicker pahanate honge.” Us ne pajama ki nadi taraf hath uthaya to mein hat gaya aur bola, “Aise nahin. Pahale ye batao ki badale men kya degi tu ?” “Tum jo kaho vo dungi.” Mein jara hichkichaya. Kaise kahun is bholi bhali ladaki ko ki mera dimag fir gaya hai ? “Unn… badale men tum teri…teri…ye dikhaogi ?” Meine socha tha ki gussa karake vo chali jayegi aur kal muze ghar se nikala jayega. Lekin aisa nahin hua. Vo sharama gayi, nicha dekh kar dhire se boli, “Achchha.” “Tu thahar jara, mein aata hun.” Kah ke mein bathroom men chala gaya. Akade hue lund ko nicker men bhara nahin ja sakata tha. Fata fat meine muth maar li. Viry chhutane ke baad pisab kiya tab lund jara narm pada, Nicker pahan kar mein baahar aaya. Nadivale javan ke pose men khada raha aur pajama ki naadi khol di. Aadha khada lund aur vrushan se nicker tan kar bhari hui thi. Fati aankhon se Mastani dekhati raha gayi. Us ka chahera sharm se lal lal ho gaya. Fir bhi vo himmat se boli, “Mein chhu sakati hun ?” “Han, han, kyun nahin ?” Meine kaha.

Vo mere paanv ke paas beith gayi. Muskurate hue, danton se hoth katate hue us ne mere samane dekha aur hath badha ke nicker upar se loda sahalaya. Kai minuto tak vo sharamati hui dekhati rahi lekin hath hataya nahin. Mera lund fir se tan gaya. Aakhir meine us ka hath hataya aur kaha, “Dekha? Aisa bhari draw karana.”

Kuchh bole bina vo khadi ho kar jaane lagi. Meine us ki kalai pakad li aur kaha, “Jaati kahan ho ? Tere vade ka kya hua ?” Vo gabharayi si boli, “Mamu, maaf kar do muze. Meri galati ho gayi. Jaane do muze.” Meine use mere bahu pash men liya aur kaha,, “Koi baat nahin. Teri maraji ke khilaf kuchh nahin karenge.” Us ne chahera utha kar mere samane dekha. Vo itani masum aur pyari lagati thi ki muz se raha nahin gaya. Meine munh se munh chipka diya. Vo chat patayi aur chhutane ka prayatn karane lagi lekin do panch seconds men shant ho gayi aur muze kiss karane diya. Meine apana munh khol jibh se us ke hoth chate to us ne bhi munh khola aur mere hoth chate. Hamai jibh ek duje ke sath khelane lagi. Meine us ke hoth chuse aur dhire se kaate. Kitani minute tak kiss chali is ka hamen pata na chala. Mastani ab uttejit ho ne lagi thi. Jo hathon ki chokadi bana kar sine par laga rakkhi thi vo ab chhod diye aur mere gae se lipata diye. Us ke nighty se dhake stan mere sine se dab gaye. Muze laga ki us ne bra pahani nahin thi. Chumban chhod meine kaha, “Ja, ab ja ke so ja. Muze padhai karani hai.”

Javab men us ne sir hila ke na kahi, muz se jyada jor se lipat gayi. Mere man men aaya ki ye meri maasum bhanji dikhati hai itani maasum hai nahin. Meine us ke kan par kiss kiya aur kan men puchha, “Masti, chodana kya hota hai ye janati ho ?”Meri pith par ek chikoti kat kar javab diya us ne. Meine fir kaha, “Pahali bar lund lete vakt dard hota hai aur khun nikalata hai ye bhi janati ho ?” Dusari chikoti jordar rahi. Mein use palang par le gaya.

Mein palang par beitha aur us ko god men bithai. Mera ek hath us ki kamar pakade hua tha. Dusare hath se meine stan tatola. Us ne meri kalai pakad li lekin mera haath hataya nahin. Us ka bhari gol stan meri hatheli men beith gaya. Kiss karate karate meine stan sahalaya aur dabaya. Kadi ho gayi hui chhoti si nipple nighty ke aar paar meri hatheli men chubh rahi thi. Meri ungaliyan ab nighty ke hook par lag gayi. Muz se hooks khule nahin aur mein adhir ho kar nighty khinchane laga to us ne apane aap fata fat hooks khol diye. Mere hath ne naga stan tham liya. Meine Mastani ko aise ghumaya ki mei us ki pith pichhe aa gaya. Bagal men se dono hath dal kar meine dono stan pakad liye.

Mastani ke stan chhote the lekin kathor the. Gore gore shanku aakar ke stan ke bich ek inch ki badami color ki areola thi. Areola par komal komal choti si nipple thi jo us vakt tatar ho gayi thi. Jab tak meine stan sahalaya, dabya aur masala tab tak Mastani kuchh boli nahin. Jaise meri chpati ne nipple pakadi vo chhat pata gayi, mera hath hatane ki koshish kar ne lagi. Mere kan men us ne kaha,”Mamu, jara dhire se. Vahan mein sparsh sahan nahin kar sakati.” Us ke baad meine nipples ko fakt chhusa, masala nahin. Mastani munh se aaah aaaaahh sssiiiiiiiiii,,,avaj karane lagi.

Stan ko chhod ab mera hath us ki jaangh par rengane laga. Ghutan se shuru kar ke jaise jaise mera hath upar taraf khiskata gaya aise aise nighyy bhi khisaskati gayi aur jangh nangi hoti chali. Gol aur chikani jaanghen Mastani ne ek duje ke saath chipaka rakkhi thi. Mere hath ke sparsh se jaangh par roen khade ho jate the. Hole hole mera hath Mastani ki bhos tak pahuncha. Mastani ne nicker pahan rakkhi thi. Jaanghen sikudi hui hone se mein panty tak pahuncha lekin meri ungalyan andar jaa na saki.

Ab meine Mastan ko dhire se palang par leta diya. French kiss karate karate meine do no stan tatola, dabaya aur nipples chusi. Mera hath fir bhos par ghumane laga. Kam ras se panty gili ho gay thi. Meine use utar dali. Mastani ne sharm se bhos dhakane ki koshish ki lekin meine us ke hath hata diye. Meine ungaliyon ki nok se sari bhos ko tatola. Bhos ke bade hoth mote the aur kale zant se dhake hue the. Chhote hoth suj gaye the aur darar se bahar nikal aaye the. Bhos ki darar kam ras se bhari hui thi, Meri ungali ne us ki chhoti si clitoris dhundh nikali. Ek inch lambi clitoris chhote se lund jaisi tatar bani hui thi, Meine clitoris ko chhua ki Mastani kud padi. Us ki jaangen sikud gayi ar taangen upar uth gayi. Mera haath pakad liya aur kan men boli, “Mamuuu…uuuuusss…. Rahane do. Sssssiii….Vahan mat chhu…..oohhh.. Mat chhuo… bahut….. Gudgudi hoti hai.” Clitoris ko chhod meri ungali chut ke munh par gayi.

Mastani ki chut chhoti aur tight thi lekin gili hone se meri ek ungali andar ja saki jo yoni patal ke paas ruk gayi. Hole hole meine ungali gol gol ghumayi jis se chut ka munh khul jaay. Ek inch ungali jo andar ja saki thi us se chut ko das minute tak choda. Jab chut relax hui tab meine do ungaliyan dal kar chaudi ki. Dhire dhire chut ka munh khulata gaya. Mastani excite ho chuki thi. Us ke kulhe dolane lage the, badan kaamp raha tha, sansen teji se chalane lagi thi aur munh se sssssiiii….sssiiii avaj hoti rahi thi. Aakhir jab tin ungaliyan chut men aasaani se aane jaane lagi tab meine us se kan men kaha, “Masti, pyari, ye aakhari ghadi hai, ab bhi maraji na ho to chali ja sakati ho.” Javab men us ne bhos par laga mera haath pakad kar daba rakkha aur daant se mera hoth kata. Meine use thik se letaya. Kulhe ke niche ek takiya rakkha jis se bhos jara upar uth aayi. Us ne khud jaanghen chaudi kar ke uthai aur dono hathon se pakad rakkhi. Kam ras se gila bhos ka gulabi andari hissa mano lund ko bula raha tha.

Mein uski jaanghon bich aa gaya. Ek haath men lund pakad kar bhos par ghisa aur gila mattha clitoris se ragada. Mastani bechain ho rahi thi, us ke nitamb sthir nahin rah pate the. Meine ek hath us ke pet par rakkha aur use sthir kiya. Dusare haath se lund ka mattha chut ke munh men tikaya aur halaka sa dabav se andar dala. Jaisa mattha chut men fasa, meine lund chhod diya, aage zuk kar us ke badan par let gaya aur munh se munh laga kar French kiss karane laga. Mastani ne apane haath meri gardan men dale. Hip hila kar meine lund chut men dalana shuru kiya to vo yoni patal tak jaa kar ruk gaya. Meine savadhani se akela mattha istemal kar ke upar upar se use choda. Mastani ne hips aise hiaye ki chut men se lund ka mattha nikal jane ki muze daheshat lagi. Meine kaha, “Masti, pyaari, jara sthir ho jao, itana nitamb na hilao.” “M…mm… mein… ku… siiiii…. Aaah… kuchh… na..nahin karati. Aap ….oh..oh tum…ch..chalu rakkho na..aap se aap ho jata hai.” Chut ko lund se parichit hone ke liye meine panch saat minute tak chhichhari chudai ki. Mastani se ab raha nahin gaya. Vo boli, “ab…ab kitani der ?”

Meine us ka munh French kiss se seal kiya. Kamar ke ek jordar dhakke se meine yoni patal toda aur aadha lund chut men pel diya. Us ke munh se jo chikh nikali vo meine mere munh men zel li. Mastani chhat patayi. Sare badan par pasina chha gaya. Jara dard kam hua tab lund ne thumaka mara to chut ko jyada chaudi kiya. Mastani ko fir dard hua. Vo boli, “Mamu, nikal le tera ye..ye..jo kaho so, bahut dard hota hai.” Kiss par kiss karate hue meine kaha, “Jara sabr kar. Abhi dard chala jayega.” Lund ne dusara thumaka lagaya. Is baar dard nahin hua. Aadha lund chut men dale mein ruk gaya tha.

Do paanch minnit men Mastani relax hui aur boli, “Chalo na Mamu….” “Itani jaldi bhi kya hai ? Thodi der or rukenge. Aur han, sar ke niche takiye daal to tu lund ka chut men aana jaana dekh sakegi.” Mein hathon ke bal addhar hua aur hamare pet bich se vo lund bhos dekhame lagi. Tagada lund ko apani bhos men fasa hua dekh kar vo sharama gayi aur hathon se apana chahera chhupa diya. Meine haath hataya to aankhen mund li. Kiss kar ke meine puchha, “Kaisa hai ab dard ?” Vo boli nahin lekin yoni sikud kar javab diya. “Aankhen khol aur dekh lund kaise chut men jata hai.” Us ne fir dekha. Is bar aadha lund bahar dekh kar vo gabharayi aur boli, “Baap re, itana bada ? Kaise…kaise jayega ? Fir se dard hoga na ?” “Na, ab kabhi dard nahin hoga. Dekh, mein ab baki ka lund dalata hun, tu dekhati rahena, dard hove to bolana.” Vo dekhati rahi aur meine halaka dabav se baki raha lund us ki chut ki gaharai men utaar diya. Mons se mons takarai. “Ye to pura andar utar gaya,” tajjub ho kar vo boli. “Kyun nahin ? Dard hota hai ab ?” “Na, nahin hota” “Kaisa lagata hai ?” Vo fir sharama gayi, Apana chahera dhak kar muskura ke dhire se boli, “Mitha lagata hai.”

Meine thodi der lund ko chut ki gaharai men dabaye rakkha. Bad men hole hole bahar nikala. Kam ras aur us ke khun se ranga hua lund dekh kar us ne kaha, “Mamu, tum ko koi dard to nahin hota na ?” “Na, muze koi dard nahin hai.” Meine fir se sara lund chut men pel diya. Muze khich ke us ne apane badan par le liya aur boli, “Aaaahhh….Mamu, itana achchha lagata hai. Tumara vo niche se mere gale tak aa jaata hai.” Muz se lipat kar kiss karane lagi. Meine us ke paanv utha kar meri kamar par lipataye aur dono hath se stan masal ne laga. Us ki yoni men halake halake fatake ho ne lage.

“Masti, ab muz se raha nahin jata. Mein dhire se chodunga. Fir bhi dard hove to muze rok dena.” Meine do inch sarikha lund bahar kincha aur andar pela. Aise chhote dhakke se meine use paanch saat minute tak choda. Jab muze tasalli hui ki us ki chut lund se parichit ho gayi hai tab meine chodane men pura lund istemal karana shuru kiya. Dhakke ki raftar dhiri hi rakkhi. Ab mein sara lund nikal kar ek zatake se chut men ghused dene laga. Mastani kulhe uchhal uchhal sahayog dene lagi. Vo bpli, “Mamu muze kuchh ho raha hai. Niche fat fat hota hai aur gudgudi hoti hai.”Hole hole chodate hue meine kaha, “Hone do jo hove so. Relax ho jao.” “Mere stan pakado na.” Meine stan tham ke nipple chipati men li. Is bar vo sahan kar paayi lekin yoni ke fatake badh gaye. Lund ko aadha dale meine kaha, “Masti, daba to lund ko.” “Kaise ?” “Yun teri yoni sikud kar.” Us ne yoni sikud kar jaisa lund dabaya vaisa lund ne thumaka liya aur meine zatake se andar pel diya. Mastani ke munh se aah nikal padi. Vo boli, “Ye to bahut mitha lagata hai. Fir ek bar.” Meine fir aadha lund nikala aur fir us ne dabaya. Hamara ye khel das baar dhakke tak chala.

Bis minute ki dhiri chudai ke bad hamari uttejana itani badh gayi ki apane aap dhakke ki raftar badh ne lagi. Mein ab fata fat jor jor se Mastani ki chut chod ne laga. Mera lund or jyada akad gaya, thumal thumak kar ne laga. Chut men lapp lapp lapkare ho ne lage. Mere har ek jordar dhakke se Mastani ka badan hichkole lene laga aur vo chhat pataane lagi. In sab ke bavajud vo zad nahin paati thi. Muze dar laga ki us se pahale mein zad jaaunga. Lund ke dhakke chau rkhate hue meine ek ungali se clitoris tatoli Achanak orgasm ne Mastani ko gher liya. Us ka badan akad gaya, muz se itana jor se lipat gayi ki mera chodana ruk gaya, aankhen jor se mund gayi, munh se laar nikal padi aur sara badan par roen khade ho gaye aur pasina chhut gaya. Thodi der vo behosh ho gayi. Us ka orgasm tis second chala.

Mastani ke hosh men aane tak mein ruka. Ek aadh minte baad us ne aankhen kholi aur boli, “Haay…Mamu, kya ho gaya muze ? Tum ne ye kya kar dala, Mamu ?” Us ke komal hothon ko chumate meine kaha, “Pyaari, ye tha tera orgasm, chudai ki charam avastha. Aaya na maja ?” “Khub maja aaya lekin mein thak gayi hun. Tum ko hua vo.. Kya bole, orgasm ?” “Nahin hua, lekin ab chodana band kar denge. Tu so ja.” Meine lund nikal na shuru kiya to us ne mere kulhe pakad daba diye aur boli, “Na Mamu, tum chalu rakkho jab tak chaho tab tak. Tumara vo to tatar hi hai. Hai na?” “Hai, abhi mein zara nahin hun is liye lund tatar hi hai.” “To…to…fir se shuru karo na.” Kah kar us ne yoni sikudi aur lund dabaya. Fir kya kahana tha ? Meine fir se unde aur tej dhakke se Mastani ko chodana chalu kar diya. Pandrah bis dhakke men mere bandh chhut gaya aur men jor se zara. Garama garam viry ki na jane kitani pichakariyan lund se chhuti. Mere saath fir ek baar Mastani bhi zari. Mein us ke badan par dhal pada. Us ke dono hath meri pith sahalane lage. Meine us par chumbanon ki barasat barasa di. Safai ki paravah kiye bina ham nange hi so gaye.

Jab meri aankh khuli tab subah ke kuchh paanch baje honge. Bahar andhera tha aur dhiri barish ho rahi thi. Mastani muze lipat kar soyi hui thi. Mera loda chut se nikal pada tha. Nind men vo or pyaari lagati thi. Kabutar ki jodi jaise us ke stan dekh kar mer man lalacha gaya. Meine halake se ek stan sahalaya aur ungali se nipple tatoli. Turant hi nipple kadi ho gayi aur us ne aankhen kholi. Muze dekh kar vo muskarayi aur fir aankhen band kar ke muz se lipat gayi.

“Uuunnn… kitane baje ?” Us ne nind bhari avaj men puchha. Meine kiss kar ke kaha, “Pata nahin, paanch baje honge.” “Mamu, fir se vo karenge ?” “Vo kya ?” Javab men us ne ek chikoti kati aur boli, “Tum janate to ho. Kal rat jo kiya tha….” “Muze yaad nahin hai ki kya kiya tha. Bol ke bata na.” Dusari chikoti kati. Boli, “Chu..chu..da..i” “Oh, fir se chudavana hai, ye na?” “Han, han,,” kah kar vo baith gayi. Meera loda pakade khelane lagi. Us ki ungalion ke sprsh se dekhate dekhate men lund tan gaya. Muze bhi dil hua tha chod ne ke liye lekin meine kaha, “Dekh , teri yoni ka ghav abhi hara hai. Jaldbaji karenge to tuze dard hoga.” “Nahin hoga. Tum bhi dekho na ye kitana tan gaya hai ?” Meine use aagosh men le kar chumban kiya. Ek hath se bhos sahalayi. Abhi bhi bhos gili thi. Mein pith ke bal le gaya aur us ko upar le liya. “Masti, mein lund khada pakade rakhata hun, tu us par beith ke chut men le.” Mere dikhane se vo apani janghen chaudi kar meri jangh par tuli. Meine lund pakada tha us par chut tika kar chutad jo niche kiye to aasaani se lund chut men ghus gaya. Jab vo puri beith gayi tab sara lund chut men utar gaya tha. Meine us ke kulhe niche haath rakh ke jaise bataya vaise vo kulhe upar niche kar ke lund lene lagi. Das pandrah talle maar kar vo thak gayi aur mere sine par dhal padi. Meine us ki pith sahalayi, use bahon men liya aur aise ghuma ki vo niche aa gayi aur mein upar. Turant us ne jaanghen pasari kulhe addhar kiye. Meine hole se lund nikala aur dala. Dhiri raftar se meine Mastani ko bis minut tak choda. Ham dono ab kafi uttejit ho gaye the. Mera lund thumak thumak kar raha tha. Zar jane ki daheshat se muze kai bar lund pura bahar nikal dena padata tha. Us ki yoni bhi har second sikud kar lund ko nichodti thi. Apane aap mere talle ki raftar aur gaharai badhane lage. Ghadi bhar mein bhul gay ki Mastani ki ye nayi nayi chudai hai. Jordar dhakke se use chodane laga. Das minute ki ghamasan chudai ke baad ham dono ek saath zare.

Zad ne ke bad bhi is vakt lund narm nahin hua. Meine chut men se nikala nahin. Yoni ke fatake shant hone tak mein ruka. Bad men fir dhakke lagana shuru kar diya, Mastani ko aashchary hua. Vo boli, “Mamu, tisari bar ? Tum ko orgasm hua nahin tha ? Ye tumara lu…lund to abhi bhi akada hua hai. “ Meine kaha, “Pyaari, tere sath hi mein bhi zada tha lekin teri chut ka svaad aaisa hai ki mera lund ko trupti nahin hoti. Tuze dard to nahin hota na ?” “Dard nahin hota. Jab tum lund andar dalate ho tab khub gudgudi hoti hai bhos men, nikalate vakt bhi. Mamu, chudai itani mithi hogi ye to meine socha tak na tha. Uiii..jara dhire…dhire se chodo na.” Tisari chudai pandrah minute chali jis ke ant men ham fir ek baar sath sath zare. Ham dono fir so gaye. Subah phone aaya ki jiju aur Kanchan salamat hein aur sham tak vapas aa jayenge. Hamare paas sara din pada tha chudai ke liye.

Din ke ujale men Mastani ne mera loda gaur se dekha. Meine use munh men lene ko kaha tab vo boli, “Chhi, chhi. Aisa ganda?” “Mein use dho kar laya hun. Ek bar le ke dekh. Pasand na aaye to nikal dena.” Mere dikhane par us ne lode ki topi khinch mattha khula kya aur munh men liya. Meine kaha, “Ab matthe ko jibh aur taalu ke bich dabaye rakh, chusana nahin.” Lekin lode ki jaat ! Sur sur karate badhane laga aur chand second men tan ke lund ho gaya. Mastani ka munh pura bhar gaya. Meine puchha, “Ganda lagata hai ? Nikal dena hai ?” “Uunnn…uunnn.” Avaj ke saath sar hila ke us ne na kahi. Mera lund thumaka lagata tha to vo jaise bachcha ma ka stan dhave vaise lund chus rahi thi. Madhoshi se us ki aankhen mund gayi thi. “Ab jara munh khol, “ meine kaha. Us ke khule munh men lund daal nikal kar meine use bis minute tak choda. Shuru shuru men vo chaar inch se jyada lund munh men le nahin sakati thi. Hole hole vo sahi technic sikhati gayi. Aakhir mein chhe saat inch lund us ke gale men dal sakata tha. Lund men se kam ras zarata tha jo us ke thunk se mil kar sara lund ko gila kiye jata tha.

Lund chusane men us ki uttejana bhi badhati ja rahi thi. Mere chhue bina nipples kadi ho gayi thi aur bhos gili ho gayi thi. Mere kahane se us ne apane hath se clitoris sahalana shuru kar diya tha. Thodi hi der men munh se lund nikal kar vo boli, “Bas Mamu, aa jao, ab muz se raha nahin jata.” Mastani ke munh se aise lafz sunate hi mera lund or akad gaya. Vo khud hi let gayi thi aur jaanghen pasaare bula rahi thi. Is bar meine der na ki. Mein upar chad gaya, lund ne khud chut la munh dhundh liya aur ek hi dhakke men meine sara lund Mastani ki yoni men ghused diya. Us ke munh se aah nikal padi. Us ke kulhe hilane lage, Mein nirdayata se us ko chodane laga. Pandrah minute ki chudai ke dauran vo tin bar zadi. Aakhir mein bhi jor se zada.

Us yaadgar din ke baad ham saavadhani se jab mauka mile tab chudai kar lete the. Mastani ke plan mutabik us ne apane sketches Dallas, America ki ek arts college men bhej diye. Use turant vahan admission mil gaya. Ticket, visa etc sab ban gaya tab us ne apane parents ko bataya. Mastani pahale America aa gayi. Chhe mahinon bad muze bhi Dallas ki ek hospital men internship mil gayi. Mein America chala aaya. America aane ke baad kya hua vo kahani fir sahi."

I am posting today to ask advice from students here. I am extremely worried about my admissions chances and I just wanted to see what students here think compared to their own experiences. This is a throwaway account. I already posted this to the ApplyingToCollege subreddit, but I wanted to get to see the perspective of current students at the university of my choice.

&amp;#x200B;

# Student Profile

* Race: White
* State: New York
* Major of choice: **Computer Science** or **Computer Engineering**
   * I chose this major not for the money or the great job outlook, but rather for the history that I have with computers. I built my first computer when I was only 12, and I have been fascinated with computers ever since. I know that this is one of the most competitive majors, especially at this school.
* Class population: \~100
* Class rank: 7
* GPA (Cumulative on a 100 point scale): 97
* Class rigor: Took the heaviest classes that my school offers. This year I am taking three math courses: Statistics, Calculus, and an independent study in accounting. I am in Advanced Placement Biology. I have a class for every period of the day.
* APs: School only really offers community college classes. I took AP Lit (I strongly disliked the course, scored a 2 on the test). And am currently in AP Biology.
* SATs: 1260 (630+630) and 1270 (650 R + 620 M) \[OCTOBER SAT\]
   * I did not expect the English to go up, as I was solely preparing for the math. The math section I got 5 less incorrect, yet scored lower. This will super-score to a 1280 though..
* Regents Scores:
   * Algebra 1: 86
   * Earth Science: 94
   * Geometry: 80
   * Chemistry: 80
   * Algebra 2: 84
   * English: 99
   * United States History: 99
   * Global History: 98
   * Physics: 84
* Extracurriculars:
   * Future Business Leaders of America (10-12)
      * This club is my pride and joy. I was a founding member of the club during my sophomore year. I competed at the state level. This year I will compete again at the state level and hopefully go on to compete at nationals. I hope to put my school on the map, bringing others with me.
   * National Honor Society (10-12)
      * Event coordinator for many events. Overall, pretty inactive other then that.
   * Counselor for a large leadership conference (11)
      * Served as a counselor for kids in 10th grade to learn leadership and tolerance skills. Was asked to return this year to aid with computers, cameras, and microphones.
   * Class President (9-10)
      * Developed a website with HTML and CSS development (used a repository for Javascript functions). Created fundraising opportunities (Including an event for pediatric cancer).
   * Baseball (10-12)
      * Played baseball my entire life. Dominated my freshman year on Junior Varsity. Got called up to varsity during tenth grade and remained there. I am a pitcher and a third baseman. Don't really think I am good enough for it to impact my college decision.
   * Technology Internship (11)
      * During my summer between my junior and senior year of highschool I partook in a technology internship with my school. I worked in an office environment, as well as with the equipment that the students use. Closest thing I could get to computer science... Even though it is really IT. Was pretty cool though.
   * Indoor Track (9,10,12)
      * I throw shotput and sprint. I was mediocre but should be a lot better this year after lifting for a while.
   * Student Council Member (9,10,11)
      * Organized events, helped with fundraising. Not super active here either.
   * Student Representative for District Safety Council (12)
      * My district picked one student to represent the student body on issues dealing with safety. I am that student. I attend meetings dealing with sensitive matters for our school.

&amp;#x200B;

# My Concerns:

* I took the October SAT. This really destroyed my confidence, as I really thought I had the math section down. I just wanted to increase my math score towards 700+ territory, but my English went up instead.. **Should I retake and pay the late fee for November?**
* My regents scores in the math area are low, combined with my SAT. I really, really love math. I have always enjoyed it. These scores definitely make it look like my small-school life has been inflated in terms of grades. I feel like an awfully small fish in a large pond.
* Computer science is becoming *the* major to go into.. I have always had a passion for learning about computing and its applications, now I will probably be seen as a liability to programs due to my standardized scores.

\*EDIT\* Thanks to those that commented! I know that people don't usually post things like this here, but I just needed some input from actual college students. I have a lot of thinking to do!"

**PART 1 -WCW MONDAY NITRO 12/04/1995**

&amp;#x200B;

\-An important show note is brought up at the top by Bischoff: apparently due to their wild antics over the past few weeks, Hogan, Flair and Giant are all on PROBATION! Seeing how Hogan knocked out a \*\*\*\*ing ref, yeah, I'm pretty sure he's lucky probation is all that he got. I'm sure this in no way will have and bearings on future episodes of Nitro. Nope!

&amp;#x200B;

1: WCW TAG TITLE MATCH: AMERICAN MALES VS HARLEM HEAT (W/SISTER SHERRI) (C)

Wait, what?!?!?! When the \*\*\*\* did Harlem Heat win the tag titles? The last time we saw the tag titles on any WCW show, the Males won them. From HARLEM HEAT! And then they vanished into the ether for 3 months! I also want to take a moment to chuckle at the fact that MONGO is the most reasonable person on commentary, for pointing out how he doesn't understand why WCW is giving away TWO title matches (this one and the WORLD TITLE later) on free tv instead of saving it for PPV. You and I both McMichael, you and I both! As for the match, the crowd is into this, but holy crap, they do NOT represent my thoughts and opinions. It's pretty decent whenever Booker and Bagwell are in the ring (which is hilarious when you remember that this match would kill the idea of a WWE run WCW show in 2001), but like slow death whenever Stevie Ray and Riggs are in there. Plus, like every Harlem Heat match ever, this match is less about the match, and more about WACKY OVERBOOKED MANAGER ANTICS! Col. Parker shows up with a present for Sherri, and if you remember your WCW history, Heat lost the tag titles LAST time they wrestled the Males because they were thrown off their gameplan by Parker taking Sherri to the back to bang her mid match. This time, he's brought her a RING, and AGAIN she leaves with him! And once AGAIN, this causes the Heat to get COMPLETELY DISTRACTED AND THROWN OFF OF THEIR GAMEPLAN! The funny thing? NONE OF THIS HAS ANY BEARINGS ON THE FINISH! Booker manages to stop Buff's hot tag offense, hit the Harlem Hangover, and win! #LOLWhat?!?!?! Man, I really feel like you could tell Booker was something special in this match though. If you've never seen the Harlem Hangover before, it's a big ass dude doing a rolling leg drop from the top rope, and is absolutely awesome to see. Also choice was Booker opting to do a Pump Splash into knees rather than the usual Jumping Nothing into a foot, as well as giving us my favorite moment of the match: missing an elbow drop, but using the then unnamed SPINAROONI as a kip up and hitting a Harlem Side Kick. Booker, you may be a terrible commentator, but even in 1995 you were A+ material my friend.

RESULTS: Harlem Heat def. American Males (Booker pinned Bagwell)

&amp;#x200B;

\-Mean Gene gets to chat with a variety of D&amp;D alignments here, as he interviews Neutral Good Sting, and Chaotic Neutral Lex Luger (who is still allies with the Neutral Evil Dungeon of Doom). At Starrcade, these two and Lawful Evil Ric Flair will be facing each other in a “Triangle Match” (aka: a Triple Threat match), with the winner facing Chaotic Good Macho Man for his World title. However, this all could be shaken up tonight as Luger is getting a shot at Savage's title, and I'm not sure of what that means for the Starrcade should the title change happen. And we all know that the odds of that are high, right? Ahem... Anyhow, this is a lot of exposition for such a short promo segment, thouh other than what I just laid out, it's just Sting and Lex saying “Hey, I like you, we're good friends, but I won't go easy on you when we wrestle with title implications!” Note: while we're rating the top WCW stars based on D&amp;D alignment, the rest of the Horsemen are Lawful Evil along with Ric except for Pillman and his “I want to watch the world burn” attitude, he's totally Chaotic Evil. And Hogan is Lawful Good with an asterix next to his name, with a note saying “he acts Lawful Good, but THIS OPPRESSIVE ORANGE D\*CKBAG IS ABSOLUTELY LAWFUL EVIL!” This note has been brought to you by the WCW Monster Manual!

&amp;#x200B;

2: STING VS KURASAWA

Hooboy... So remember a while back, when Savage wrestled Kurasawa, and it was utter garbage? Remember recently when Sting wrestled Malenko, and it ruled because because it was a longer than expected back and forth match? Yeah, this is closer to being Savage/Kurasawa than Sting/Malenko sadly. It's super short, most of it is Kurasawa taking Sting to the woodshed, then Sting punches him a few times, hits the Stinger Splash, pushes him down, locks in the Scorpion Deathlock, and that's it. What a disappointment! I like to imagine that Kurasawa only lost so quick because he was thrown off because his plantation owner manager was \*\*\*\*ing Sherri instead of being out on the apron dabbing sweat off of his own forehead with a handkerchief. 

&amp;#x200B;

3: SCOTT NORTON VS THE GIANT (W/JIMMY HART AND KEVIN SULLIVAN)

Hey, Norton is wrestling someone who's not The Shark! PROGRESS! And that's about it for nice things I have to say, because we've got a really long main event, and that means HALF of tonight's matches are squash match length. Okay, I have one additional nice thing to say about the match: Norton shows how legit powerful he is by countering a headlock with a SUPER DELAYED Atomic Drop! He had Giant up in the air, over his head, for a good 3-4 seconds, and while I doubt Giant was the 500lbs they billed him as at this point, HOLY \*\*\*\*! The only other thing worth noting was Bischoff making me LOL by saying that the C in WCW stands for Commitment. WORLD COMMITMENT WRESTLIN EVERYONE! #LOLWhat?!?!?! Otherwise though, yeah, this is just a lot of slow clubbering, and Giant countering a Jumping Nothing with a Chokeslam.

RESULTS: Giant def. Norton via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

\-And now for something truly random: Mean Gene brings out Ric Flair for an interview, and Flair comes out with basketball player Charles Barkley! Not to be confused with CeeLo Green's original band Gnarls Barkley, although that'd be pretty awesome as well, if I'm being honest. This is short in duration, but long in pointlessness, as it mostly just exists for Charles to be like “Ric Flair is the best!”, to put over the Phoenix Suns, and for Flair to scream ramble a bunch of stuff about Barkley maybe joining the Horsemen. Hah, like they'd ever let a non-wrestling pro sports guy join the Four Horseman! Ahem...

4: MAIN EVENT - WCW WORLD TITLE MATCH: LEX LUGER (W/JIMMY HART) VS MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE (C)

Of all of the matches on the card, why does THIS ONE get 15 minutes?!?!? It's pretty much on par with what we saw from these two on PPV - which means a lot of slow paced bad kicking and punching - and anyone who's watched any amount of WCW's main event scene knows that this is ending in a schmozz anyway, so why couldn't THIS be the show's 2-3 minute match? There are some choice moments, I'll admit, I really liked Savage going after Luger's arm in almost an attempted scene by scene recreation of the way Luger injured his OWN. The WWE commentary team usually thinks this phrase means “good guys are allowed to cheat in this instance”, but THAT is a good use for the term “turnabout is fair play”. And in fact, Mongo actually uses that very line! It also really messes with the pacing and roles of the match, where heel ass Luger is getting grinded down in heat spots by babyface ass Savage. What, are we trying to put heat on the heel so he can make a babyface comeback? It works for the story of the match though, in that Savage wants to wreck Luger's arm in retribution for his own injury, it just feels weird is all. It also works for me in that Luger's idea of selling damage is to go “ARGGGGGH!” really loudly, and that never fails to crack me up! Also pretty choice (and hilarious) was Savage reacting to getting his eye poked by PUNCHING THE REF, because he was blinded and couldn't see who he was punching, hahaha! Made even more hilarious by the fact that the REF DIDN'T EVEN GO DOWN! #LOLWhat?!?!?! So Savage's arm is powerful enough to win matches in two moves, but can't even hurt weak ass Randy \*\*\*\*ing Anderson? OKAY THEN! Anderson DOES get knocked out proper off of a non-punch bump when Luger tries to ram Savage's head against the exposed turnbuckle (the pad was removed by Hart, off camera, because WCW), but Savage reverses it, Luger takes the bump, and crashes into the ref. This KILLS HIM more than a punch ever does, because WCW! Savage sees that there's no ref in sight, but still goes up to the top, hits the Big Elbow, and goes for the pin, because Savage is apparently 10 times dumber than even Sting. And then he randomly tries to beat up Jimmy Hart, and LET THE OVERBOOKED CLUSTER\*\*\*\* BEGIN! Flair charges the ring and punches Savage with “brass knuckles” (or rather, that thing Arn loves using that looks like a plastic knife bent up into knucks), this summons Hogan to deal with Flair, and the only thing that saves Ric from a beating is that the ref wakes up and starts to count a pin on Savage, so Hogan SHOVES THE REF OVER to stop him from crowning Lex the new champion, and then TRIES TO BEAT UP JIMMY HART! Remember that he's on PROBATION FOR THIS VERY KIND OF BEHAVIOR! Sting comes out while Hogan is single handedly dispatching Hart and Luger and OOPS! HOGAN ACCIDENTALLY PUNCHES STING! Now Sting and Hogan are in a shoving match, and Savage has to break things up! WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD \*\*\*\*ING IDEA?!?!?!

RESULTS: Luger def. Savage via DQ, apparently?

&amp;#x200B;

\-With things seemingly calmed down, Mean Gene tries to keep the peace by... yelling at Hogan for breaking probation again?!?!?! Hogan says he's absolutely not concerned with probation (???), and then QUESTIONS STING AGAIN! Hogan... YOU WERE THE ONE WHO \*\*\*\*ING PUNCHED STING IN THE \*\*\*\*ING FACE YOU ORANGE \*\*\*\*ING D\*CKBAG!!!! Sting tries his hardest to (once again) explain: he doesn't approve of Luger's affiliation with Hart, but Lex is still his best friend, and he's trying to steer Luger onto the straight and narrow. Note: Sting is the only reasonable person in the ring, because Savage responds with “I SAID THAT LUGER WAS EVIL ALL ALONG AND I WAS RIGHT YEAAAAH”, but finally Hogan remembers that Sting is his “good friend dude”, Sting promises to keep Luger out of Hogan's business, and I feel like I lost at least 40 points of IQ from this whole storyline.

**PART 2 -WWE MONDAY NIGHT RAW 12/04/1995**

&amp;#x200B;

Unimportant show note: If you want to know how highly the WWE valued Shane Douglas/why he decided hanging out in ECW would be a better career move, scope out the introduction “what's happening tonight” video, where Vince outright calls him “the 15 minute chump” in regards to his short IC title reign. WELL VINCE, TELL US HOW YOU REALLY FEEL!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

1: BOB “SPARK PLUG” HOLLY VS THE BRITISH BULLDOG (W/JIM CORNETTE)

Hey, you know what'll make Bulldog look really strong for his World title match against Bret Hart? Putting him against a lower level Occupational Gimmick guy! Woo...hoo? On the plus side, I don't think that Holly got the memo explaining that this is the 1995 WWF, because instead of coming out with bad kicky punchy chinlocky offense, he opens up in PURE FIRE mode, working like he was making a hot fired up comeback in a Southern territory promotion. To OPEN the match! Some might say that this Holly is a little hardcore, ahem. All kidding aside here, Holly's working like a Cruiserweight compared to the usual 95 WWF pace, and the beautiful side effect of this is that even when Bulldog slows the action down during the heel heat portion of the match, it still plays out like a 95 WWF match on fast forward. How the hell is a 1995 Raw opening match the best thing I've reviewed from this week's shows thus far?!?!?! We also get a pretty cool in ring story here, as Bulldog clearly has the power advantage, but Holly is able to use his speed and technical know how to escape most attempts to overpower him, and is able to mostly overwhelm him with fast paced Southern junior heavyweight offense. Man, if I wasn't familiar with him already, this is the kind of match that would make me go “Bob Holly? Huh, this guy might go on to be something.” This story plays beautifully into the finish as well, as Holly does the old Pump Splash out of the corner spot to avoid an Irish Whip into the buckles, but Bulldog is right behind him, catches him on his shoulder, and hits the Running Power Slam to get the win, leaving me wishing that this were happening as a marquee match with a good 15 minutes because damn, the 5 or 6 we got was REALLY good stuff.

RESULTS: Bulldog def. Holly via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

\-We get recap footage of last week, when Backlund randomly slipped into the ring to Crossface Chickenwing Bret Hart, and this is notable mostly because it includes BONUS footage from the weekend syndicated shows, where he did the same to GOOD OL' JR! THE DASTARD! This directly brings us to Lawler conducting an interview with Backlund from ringside. Or rather from the crowd, because he's out there campaigning again. Apparently next week, Backlund is getting a non title match against Hart, and he FREAKS THE \*\*\*\* OUT when he learns that the title is not on the line, screaming sh\*t about how he had dreams of being GOD so he could REIGN OVER ALL THE PLEBIANS! Holy sh\*t, insane Mr Bob Backlund is one of the best character reinventions ever, I swear! He keeps screaming nonsense as Vince tries to send to commercial break and they wind up having to CUT HIS MIC! Crazy Old Man Backlund rules so hard you guys, I can't even explain it. 

&amp;#x200B;

2: FATU VS THE BROOKLYN BRAWLER

Do I even need to describe this? Probably not, but I will, because I can cover this match in a single sentence. Brawler hits just enough bad striking offense to look like he's a wrestler, Fatu fights back with a Backbreaker, a Running Cutter, and finishes with the Splash. If “Make A Difference” is secret code for “win a boring, short squash match”, then Fatu just made the biggest difference possible here.

RESULTS: Fatu def. Brawler via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

\-Hey, something of importance (or at least something fun) happens during the Dok “I'm More Of An N-Word Than You” Hendrix's (seriously, THIS WAS A THING HAYES SAID TO MARK HENRY, ONLY HE USED THE ACTUAL WORD!) Slam Jam report, as Vince cuts him off mid sentence to send us backstage, where Backlund has TRACKED DOWN THE SOUND ENGINEER for cutting his mic off earlier! And slaps HIM in the Crossface Chickenwing! Also, we learn that Owen Hart's open contract (he's looking for a REAL challenge, remember) has been signed, and he'll be taking on Diesel, who I guess is still a babyface now, even though the last time we saw him he was acting like a total d\*ckbag heel? I guess he didn't turn heel, he just turned into a 2018 babyface several decades ahead of his time.

&amp;#x200B;

3: IC TITLE MATCH: DEAN DOUGLAS VS RAZOR RAMON (C)

More proof of how low Douglas' stock must have been with the company at this point: would you believe that this match (a TITLE MATCH remember) gets less time than the opener? At BEST it maybe gets just as much time. Hahaha, wow... To be fair, the Dean DOES get to look pretty good at the top of the match, as he jumps Razor before the match starts and unloads really fast pace kicky punchy offense. Razor takes over from there, and as soon as Douglas reverses his fortunes and goes into the heel heat portion of the bout... we go to commercial break. What IS this, 2018 SDL?!?!?! And then after the break, Razor just wins it without even making a proper comeback. He just kicks out of a pin off of a Cross Body, hits one clothesline, and then the Razor's Edge for the win. WOMP WOMP!

RESULTS: Ramon def. Douglas via pinfall

&amp;#x200B;

\-Hooboy, it's more Brother Bruce “Love” Prichard, and I can assure you that it's not rumor and innuendo that his guest is King Mabel. No word on whether he got this persona from the Box of Gimmicks. After some boasting about how he's going to destroy Undertaker at IYH, Mabel is upset to learn that Brother Love has a surprise for him (because he doesn't like surprises, you see): a CASKET is being pushed out to the ring, because UNDERTAKER FEUD! It turns out that it's TWO surprises in one though: Surprise number one is that SIR MO is the man dressed like a Druid to push out the casket! Surprise number two is that... the casket has been covered in graffiti? King Mable loves it? WHAT THE \*\*\*\* DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING? WHO GIVES A \*\*\*\* ABOUT A RANDOM DEFACED COFFIN? This isn't even psychological warfare! It's just “Heh, look at this prop!”

&amp;#x200B;

4: SYCHO SID (W/TED DIBIASE) VS MARTY JANNETTY

Okay, so in our prior match, Dean Douglas was decried as some kind of scumbag for attacking Razor before the match starts, but when Jannetty does it here, it's perfectly fine? The World Wrestling Federation: The NEW Standard In Double Standards! This plays out like a slower paced version of our opener: Marty starts out with fired up babyface comeback offense but it's slower than Holly's, and when Sid controls the match, it is like watching a 1995 WWF match at NORMAL speed. Because Sid might be the master and the ruler of the world, but he has neither mastered nor ruled at workrate, I guess. Don't worry though, Marty gets a really hot comeback to kick the action (briefly) back into gear, even breaking out a Gawddamn DIAMOND DUST in the process! And then... we go to commercial (sigh) as his comeback kicks into gear, and come back to MORE slow paced heel heat. Can we get Backlund to go Chickenwing #FireKevinDunn, assuming he was in charge of production at this point?!?!?! Don't worry though, if you were worried that this one was going to have a hot, clean finish, then you can breathe easy and know that this ends on a bullsh\*t cluster\*\*\*\*. 1-2-3 Kid runs out to attack Marty because... reasons, Ramon runs out and goes after Kid, we get the bell signifying that this is over but hey, Sid still hits Marty with the Powerbomb, so I guess this is a small victory for the heels? Not an actual victory though.

RESULTS: Jannetty def. Sid via DQ

&amp;#x200B;

\-MAIN EVENT TALKING: Yes, our actual main event is not only an interview, it's an interview featuring a NON-WRESTLER! Specifically, with HBK's PHYSICIAN! THAT'LL put some butts in the seats! C'mon Soupies, chant along with me: POST-CON-CUSS-ION! CLAP CLAP CLAPCLAPCLAP! All of this is just the most heavy handed attempt to dump SUPER SYMPATHY on Vince's favorite boy toy, and to paint the picture that maybe he'll NEVER COME BACK, but also maybe he'll come back. Seriously, scrape away all of the melodramatic horsesh\*t and that's all that we get out of this segment. And it's LONGER THAN ANY MATCH ON THE SHOW! All of this culminates into Vince delivering a SUPER SACCHARINE “Hey, our WWF Superstars may look, act and seem like superhumans, but they're really just human beings like the rest of us you know” speech, and WHAT THE \*\*\*\* AM I EVEN WATCHING?!?!?!?! No, seriously, how does this help business? How does this do anything but HURT business? This is still during the dying days of kayfabe, so the business was still presented as if it were a shoot, how does going “Hey, these guys are regular dudes” make anyone want to keep watching? ESPECIALLY for a company that has traditionally always presented it's wrestlers as living cartoon characters who were beyond larger than life? Congrats WWF, you managed to sh\*t the bed way worse than the stupid note that Nitro ended on this week!

&amp;#x200B;

**TV RATINGS:** Raw def. Nitro 2.6 - 2.4. Eh, it's hard for me to really even think about which show was better of the two this week, because neither show was particularly good. I guess Raw's hot opening match and lame (but probably compelling at the time) “HBK and his broken brain” mini documentary/interview at the end was probably more likely to draw in viewers than anything WCW was doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT:** Considering I feel like Holly vs Bulldog was the only thing all week (non-Bob Backlund edition) thing I truly enjoyed, yeah, how could it be anything BUT that?

&amp;#x200B;

**LOWLIGHT OF THE NIGHT:** I don't even know where to go here. I kinda WANT to make it a tie between the non-wrestling endings to both shows, but I traditionally only use matches for these and there were plenty of meh moments to choose from. Ultimately, I'm going to give the nod to Sting/Kurasawa. Sure, the match was no worse than anything else we saw all week, but given the classics we've seen both guys have on Nitro, I think it was the match that had the most potential, and offered the most disappointment by coming nowhere CLOSE to said potential. So there, if anyone thinks I'm just a biased WCW guy (I probably am, but still), note that I gave Raw the edge over Nitro here this week. 

&amp;#x200B;

**NEXT WEEK:** Hulk Hogan and Sting form the overpowered John Cena + Additional John Cena of tag teams in order to take on Ric Flair and Arn Anderson! I'd make jokes about how gee, I wonder who'd win this thing, but \*\*\*\*, you could have Sting jump ship, put Luger and Savage on the heel team as well, and it'd STILL either be “bullsh\*t cluster\*\*\*\* non-finish”, or “LOL Hogan Wins!” And on Raw, current World Champion Bret Hart takes on former World Champion/current psychopath Bob Backlund in a match that is so frustratingly non-title that Backlund had to rant about being God! Will he fulfill his dream of ruling over the plebians? STAY TUNED TO FIND OUT!

\-The Intern"
9pvfi7,0,2018-10-20,Trying to make light of a situation,WorldlyCate,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9pvfi7/trying_to_make_light_of_a_situation/,"So i recently had an interview for an tax internship in industry, with about 80 total employees in the Midwest region.

&amp;#x200B;

The company historically accepts students from my school due to the partner, and managers having attended my school. I went in for an interview and thought i answered all the bs questions about deadlines, what would you do in this situation, yadayada.   

On my resume, I have a 3.6 cumulative GPA, President of the Accounting Club at my school, team captain of a sports team, and I have my own consulting firm that does Microsoft Excel VBA for local businesses (about-6) I also have experience preparing taxes (1040, 1120s ect) 

I found out that I didn't get the job, but a friend of mine, (Female) did get the job, even though she has a 3.2 GPA, no tax experience, and no extra curricular.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just trying to make light of the situation and figure out why I may have not been hired. I think it could have been because they dont use Microsoft Excel at all, which they account for the 10% of firms that dont use it. So maybe I overwhelmed them with my knowledge of sumifs, vlookups, pivot tables. I dont know. Just extremely shocked and depressed I did not receive this position."

I'm looking for a good anime that I can watch. But I have a busy  schedule ahead of me like I can only watch anime on Saturday and Sunday evenings (damn life damn internships why you ruin my neet life¡¿¡¿¡¿) so please help me  find an anime that is really really worth my time in my busy sched. Anime is my safe haven after getting beaten up by life.
Last anime I watched was shokugeki no soma 4th season , wotaku no koj was muzukashi, violet evergarden and BNHA s3.
currently watching: kishuku gakkou no Juliet, irozuku sekai no ashita kara and toaru majutsu III
So can I ask at least 4 or 5 anime series from spring to fall 2018? Preferably fall anime so I can watch it on a weekly basis but I'm fine with spring and summer as well. I'm not really picky in genre as long as it's not some dark themed or some crappy harem I'm okay  with it

I'm a college student about 3 hours from home, I'm studying engineering and am interning this semester and an engineering firm. I work a 40 hour week and have a 20 minute commute. My car broke down last week and I've taken it to get fixed twice and each time literally I drive 4-5 miles away from the garage and it breaks down. The last week I've been bumming rides to get to work for my roommates but one day I had physically no way to get there and had to call off. My car is still broken and I've just dropped it off at a new garage. I feel hopeless. I have no way to get to work next week. Im too young to rent a car, my roommates can't take me. I feel like I have no options and that I'm going to lose my internship which will push my graduation back a year which I can't afford. I've asked my parents for help but they don't have an extra car that I could borrow and can't help me financially. And I know it's that they can't help me and not that they won't help me but that's what it feels like. Im out of options and terrified. I feel like i have worked so hard to get where am I, first to graduate high school and go to college in the family, but I'm still not going to make it. I know some many other people have bigger issues than me but I just feel so hopeless and alone. "

9pxux6,7,2018-10-20,Recent BBA grad with Internship - Unemployed 6 months,1z2x33,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/9pxux6/recent_bba_grad_with_internship_unemployed_6/,"Hello! This is my first time participating on Reddit. I have used Reddit for research on companies and careers, and appreciate your desire to help others. Thank you.

I graduated in the fall of 2017 from a semi-prestigious private university. It is nearly 100 years old, has hosted numerous national and world leaders, and is likely known among a certain, overwhelming demographic in the US. It is no Ivy League though.

I decided to major in business management my sophomore year. I feel like business comes naturally to me. I have wanted to own my own business for a long time. I will add that I am an INTJ for those curious. I was the treasurer and later president of a national business club chapter my last two years, and was in charge of a very successful fundraising effort via a concession stand at school sports games.

Unfortunately, I had a rough transition into college and had academic and personal problems, overcame them and improved, but graduated with a 2.91 GPA. My major specific GPA 3.66. I don't list my GPA on about half of my resumes, while on the rest I use my major specific.

Just prior to fall graduation, I applied and was accepted into a hyper-competitive spring internship with a top 50 company in Fortune's 500. I was thrilled and assured by everyone that future ERs would love this. The only ""negative"" is that the internship wasn't related to my field of study, and the uneducated may have misconceptions about it. The internship was 5 months of intensive customer service, and while I could have stayed, I chose to leave because the money was not there. My only dislike was the low pay. It was the happiest I've ever been. I know I could go back there now because my department liked me, but I don't see much of a career there.

Now I am back living with my parents and applying for jobs in a huge city. I have applied and had numerous phone and f2f interviews in many different industries including: Logistics, Insurance, Hospitality, Customer Service, and Recruiting. I did use a Temp agency once and got a f2f. People have told me that I am good at interviewing. I feel I am very polished, rarely use fillers, and customize everything to the ER based upon lengthy research. I print my resumes and covers on resume paper, carry them in a leather portfolio, use a nice pen, and take notes.

The biggest name I have had a f2f with would be Walmart, I guess followed by Southwest Airlines, Hilton, Omni, Travelers, Chick fil-A...

I've applied at every decent hotel in the city, had only a handful of f2f with them, but **my only offer over these entire 6 months was for $12/hr at a hotel desk**. I declined because I could not survive on that in the city. It is extremely frustrating because it's not like I am applying to jobs that I am not qualified for. I even apply to some that I am under-qualified for. I had read all over Reddit that college grads are a shoe-in for ASM jobs at Walmart. So wrong. Most ERs take 1-2 months to reply to me. Walmart takes 2. I've have taken so many different assessments tests. I have been used and lied to more than I was expecting. I always keep my cool, but some of these ERs have been surprisingly unprofessional. The most surprising was Chick fil-A for a mgnr trainee, but that's life.

I have an ""all-star"" LinkedIn profile with just under 40 connections, and I am going on my third month of their $50 premium service. I had the VP of a large company reach out to me on there, but that's been it. I hardly get any views or searches. It's all set up to in the settings to present me as open to recruiters. Never have been a LinkedIn believer. My generic resume is available to recruiters on Indeed and Monster.

I've become extremely desperate. I believe I command at minimum $16/hr, and assume I'll get something around $14-20. In one college course the professor had us write what we thought our first salaries after graduating would be on the board. I wrote 30-35k and the professor kinda joked and people laughed. It was slightly embarrassing, but I've always been a realist. Everyone else put 50k and on up. I laughed at them on the inside. I know you have to have big goals and I do, but I know a big salary takes experience.

I knew I would have to ""embrace the broom"" as Warren Buffet says, and I am all about working from the bottom to the top. I just feel like every day is just another day not making money. Student loans hurt. Unemployment is taking a big toll on my psyche. I sit at a computer and work on jobs all day. I volunteer twice a week at a local food bank to break things up. I am so tired of hearing the same advice from my family every day. I've heard every analogy out there. I've tried different resume formats. I used to tell my close friends whenever I'd get an interview, but now I hardly tell them anymore because it always ends up being a no. 

TLDR

I feel like I am doing everything right. I have had multiple stages of interviews, shadowed, and written essays. I've racked up over 2k miles on my car just to and from ERs.

Is there any advice you could give me please? Should I be worrying by now? I've read that once the gap gets too big, then it's bad news. Do you recommend any sites besides Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn? I feel like my college was a waste and I could have been better off going to a more affordable school. No ER ever says a word about college and that really, really bugs me. They know I just graduated. I have a clean background. I don't lie. I am good at making conversation and while I usually get a few genuine laughs during interviews, I always stay professional. I always feel like my f2fs go well. I feel like I check all the right boxes, but I can't wipe this L off my forehead. What gives? How long were you unemployed?

Thanks for hanging around and taking the time to help me. Best of luck to my fellow unemployed redditors."
9py7dx,1,2018-10-20,I feel so defeated and broken - is this depression or just a phase in life or both?,type4000diabetes,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9py7dx/i_feel_so_defeated_and_broken_is_this_depression/,"Recently I have been feeling so unbelievably empty, defeated, and broken inside. I have had phases of sadness before and I could handle them okay.

But this is a whole new level that I never knew existed.

I’ll try my best to describe it. I feel this subtle pain in my chest everyday. It feels crippling and it’s to the point where the only thing that sounds enjoyable to me is eating and sleeping. 

My diet has gotten worse. That’s on me though but I am so broke I can only eat at my college campus on a meal plan. And I have only so much healthy things I can choose because most things are really unhealthy. I want to be more healthy and I need to eat healthier.

I feel so numb. I feel disconnected with myself at times and just...like a robot.

I’ve noticed I have grown more negative as a person. And that I am pretty apathetic to people and things that happen to me or others.

My hair is falling out. I don’t know if it’s because of my diet or my stress or what but my hair is actually falling out and I’m so scared that it’ll all fall out. I’m trying to be more calm about it but seeing my hair fall out so much is so scary.

I have two jobs, an internship, and part of clubs and such. I also will have 20,000 dollars of debt by the time i graduate college and that thought just cripples me further.

I’m always tired. I feel like I’m living in a shit hole and I don’t know. 

I tried out therapy but it didnt help me and I wasted money on better help and with that I feel even more defeated.

I see it in other people too. Just how tired people look and how dead they sound. And it sucks.

I feel so lost and I don’t know what I’m doing or who I am. 

Tl;dr: I feel so broken and defeated and am wondering if is this possibly depression.

Thoughts?

9pyexd,10,2018-10-20,My old boss (60sF) is making my (29M) new job a living nightmare,throwaway10111980,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9pyexd/my_old_boss_60sf_is_making_my_29m_new_job_a/,"Hey everyone first off let me say, throw away because a lot of people know my main account. Also, I apologize for the wall of text that is ahead.

Forgot TL:DR

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

So 5 years ago I graduated college and was applying to PA programs. I unfortunately did not get in any programs that fall, so I decided to move to a big city on the west coast. I applied to more schools out west and didn't get in. I then decided my best bet was to get more patient care hours so I got a job in a hospital, it wasn't ideal because my degree unfortunately is meaningless without grad school.

The job I get was entry level but it paid well and I was able to start paying back student loans and learn about inner workings of hospitals and see different departments. I loved my job because I was able to interact with patients, nurses, doctors pretty much all hospital staff.

I was hired on the midnight shift and during my first year I asserted myself as a leader and someone you could depend on. I worked almost 3200 hours my first year as my department was always short staffed so overtime was easy to come by.

After my first year there I still wasn't accepted into any grad school programs. But a leadership position on afternoons opened up and I applied for it and was interviewed by a panel of managers, my manager and several others.

I and 6 others out of 24 were brought back for a second interview, this one didn't involve my manager. I was told by the panel the only reason I wasn't outright given the job is because my manager didn't believe I would do a good job and she seriously doubted my leadership skills.

I agreed that I wasn't the most assertive person, but I would do my best to lead by action and speak up when I needed to. The panel informed me that, my job wasn't to force others to work harder, that was my managers job to make sure everyone was pulling their weight.

After a few weeks I got a call and was told I got the promotion I to the lead position. A few people who had been there longer than me gave me trouble the first few weeks because, ""we have seniority"" I told my manager and she said she would handle it.

We had what I thought was a good relationship, but it quickly became apparent she would have rather had someone else in my position, someone who would follow her direction without question even if it compromised patient care or privacy.

About 6 months after I took my current position we had several employees switch departments or quit. I was working 7 days a week 12 hour shifts until they hired enough new people to fill our voids. This took around 4 months. At that time I was accepted into a local PA program and would start the following spring.

I continued working when school started but much less than what I was before because of school. During this time my relationship with my manager deteriorated even further and she made it clear she wanted me gone. The only thing was, her boss, the director of nursing ranted and raved about what a wonderful job I was doing and even though we were at 3/4 staff I was still able to manage all the work.

I finally graduated from my program 2 1/2 years after I started. At that point I needed a break from all work as I was work in 40 hours a week on top of 36 hours of interning/clinical work as well as studying. I requested all of my PTO to be used to go back home as I hadn't left to see my family in over 5 years. My PTO was approved by HR and I took off, I had 2 full months off.

During my time off I got a call from the Emergency Department, they really wanted me to come in and be a trauma PA, I was also called by our stroke unit where I did a vast majority of my internship and they were interested in me coming to them to work. I was ecstatic because both the Emergency Department and Stroke Unit were places I wanted to work. I talked it over with my family and decided to work for the Emergency Department.

I called my boss and told her that I was putting in my 2 weeks and since I had a month and a half left on my vacation I figured I would be fine starting in the ED when I returned. I told her I was offered a full time PA position and she seemed really excited for me. I notified the ED that I would be graciously accepting their offer, and that I could start as soon as I got back.

My friend who works in the department told me my boss was livid I was quitting but I didn't think much of it. I said it was too bad and people leave all the time when it is their turn to move on.

I left it at that, I was very ready to get back to the hospital and begin working. However, when I returned, i ram into a bunch of issues, firstly, HR did transfer me to the ED as a clinical staff member but didn't terminate my previous job title. My first day, my badge stopped working I couldn't use it to get into my work area, locker room, the building. I went into HR and they said my previous manager said I wasn't part of the company anymore and to terminate my badge access.

Odd but I told them I was now a PA in the ED and showed them my new credentials. They reluctantly allowed me access to my work areas.

The next week, I am pulled aside by my new boss. He asks me how everything is going and if I can swing by his office after my shift. I tell him yeah thinking it's going to be a check up on how the new job is going.

My shift ends and I go to my new bosses office. He asks me why he is hearing so many negative things about me. I ask him what he means and he tells me I have had 3 formal complaints filed against me. I ask him if I can see them and he pulls them up on his computer. The first one is about unprofesionalim in the workplace. I ask him who filed it and he said it would be better if he kept it anonymous because the second complaint was about workplace violence. The third complaint was a HIPPA violation claim.

I was taken aback because the first two complaints came from 2017, when I was in my original department. The third complaint was when I went to clean out my previous locker and I was verbatim, ""Throwaway was in a secure loaction where he sought out potential information about patients."" It was the break room that doubled as out locker room, I was only there for 5 minutes to clean out my locker.

I went to HR because all of these are serious allegations and they told me all 3 complaints were made by my former manager. I was upset that all this was happening and there is basically nothing I can do. HR conducted a formal investigation on me and found nothing to be out of place.

A few weeks later my new boss had a sit down with my previous manager where she told him, ""she will stop at nothing until I am fired."" And, ""He is the most lazy and unprofessional worker in this entire establishment.""

I went to HR to file a complaint about her and potential harassment. HR told me they are unable to file my complaint because I am under review for corrective action and a manager would never do anything like that so I should just drop it while I am ahead.

About a week later I passed my old manager and she called out me me and said, ""wow, I'm surprised you're still here, I wouldn't want a provider taking care of me with your reputation"" in a hallway in front of patients, nurses, doctors and visitors.

I tried to schedule a meeting with her to talk but she said there was ""nothing to talk about"" and my actions are ""reprehensible"" and soon enough I would be ""where I belong, out the doors""

I heard from my boss that she has been scheduling meetings with higher ups about me and my boss doesn't know if it is going to work if this ""drama"" continues.

I don't know what I should do because, I have done nothing but display the up most respect for her, she is just hellbent on ruining my career at the facility and any other place I try and move to. Is there any action I should be taking right now? I feel like I should retain a lawyer and send a cease and desist letter, because her actions and false claims could be damaging my future.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare."

I am currently at my first internship and am learning webdev/angular for the first time.  My mentor is having me take our current project (Aspnet/Angular 4/Webpack 3) and use its existing components to build it from the ground up using Angular 6 with the Angular CLI.  

As of right now, I am able to load every component correctly and access our DB with no issue.  The remaining issue is with how the components worked with our old webpack configuration.  Before, it used a very complex webpack config to build and load, but I instead swapped over to the Angular CLI with `ng serve` as I hear that is the standard.  The issue is that the components are still looking for the dist folder to pull some assets.

For example, our old webpack config would copy over some png/pdfs to the dist folder, and our project would look for them in /dist/assetName.  From my understanding, ng serve does ""build"" main.js/vendor.js, but it is in memory.  Is it still possible to use this same method, or do I need to rewrite more of our existing code.  

I am currently using [Custom-Webpack](https://github.com/meltedspark/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/custom-webpack) to let me get my needed files with `ng build`, but I am finding this prevents me from testing changes while the application is running.  I cannot seem to get custom-webpack to work with only using `ng serve`so I am not sure how to proceed.  

Thank you!"

None of us knew any English and it was hard to adjust to the foreign system and make a living. I consider myself to come from a low income background and during all of my high school and university I struggled with finances e.g. paying for basic things such as clothes, gym, phone or food. 

Throughout my teenage years I struggled with relationships because I had no family in the UK nor did I find it easy to develop lasting friendships because I couldn’t relate to others much. 90% of my teenage years was studying or working to make ends meet for my family whilst my friends or peers were going out.

I was considered to have a learning difficulty throughout my high school years until I managed to get 6 As in my GCSE exams and got into engineering university. During university I managed to complete a finance internship in Panama and a technology internship in China and come out top 10 in my class. 

After my bachelors, whilst struggling with finances I began a masters in Data Science and at the same time I was working 2 part time jobs as my family had no savings and I needed to fund my education. Every summer of my life since 16 I have worked. 

Now I am close to go graduating I find myself being contacted by Google, HSBC. Microsoft and other respectful institutions who want me to apply for their programmes. I have also got a partner whom I met in university and who loves me for who I am and we got engaged last month. "

She is an international student, so that can provide additional challenges in terms of getting sponsorship for visa etc. I told her that her primary focus, in addition to doing well in classes, should be focused on getting an internship or co-op, even it means finishing her degree in 2~2.5 yrs.

It's been about 3 months since the break-up, basically NC since then as well. It was really hard for me at first, and then it started getting better. I wasn't thinking about him that much, I was getting my life together, and in general I felt like I was on my way to recovery.

I am super stressed right now with school and networking and trying to find internships, and me still being this sad over my break up 3 months after is not helping the situation at all and is just making me more stressed and mentally unstable.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have lived together for 2 1/2 years. In January of this year, I got an internship opportunity in a city 3,000 miles away. He supported me going, and we decided to try the long distance thing for a few months. It was incredibly harder than I thought as he's horrible at calling/texting regularly. I ended up falling in love with the city, and plan on going back after I graduate in December. He knows this, but we had been putting off the conversation about what that meant for our relationship. To complicate things further, I was diagnosed bipolar about 2 months ago. My moods have been incredibly hard to deal with, but I am doing everything I medically can to get it under control as soon as possible. I know it's been difficult on my boyfriend, as he has his own depression issues, but he assured me he loved me before and he'd love me after.

&amp;#x200B;

Then this happened last night.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and our roommate threw a party at my house. I wasn't super keen on the idea of a bunch of random people being at our house, but my boyfriend was really excited and I wanted to let him do his thing. He got pretty drunk early on, and was way more social than usual. While he was talking to my best friend a couple feet in front of me, I saw him put his arm around the lower back area of another girl he was talking to. I immediately pulled him aside and called him out on it, like why the hell would you do that right in front of me? He told me I was being silly and downplayed it, but it really bothered me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hanging out with my friends and didn't talk to my boyfriend that much. At around 3 am, after venting to my best friend, I wanted to go to bed. She was supposed to sleep on the couch but there were people everywhere still, so I told her to sleep with me and let my boyfriend sleep in the living room. As we were talking, one of my boyfriends friends came in the room and saw that I had been crying. He knew exactly what I was upset about and even though I didn't say anything about it, he went and told my boyfriend to come check on me.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend comes in and immediately starts being mean to me, and by this time I am totally sober. I try to tell him I am just going to bed, we can talk about it tomorrow, go enjoy your friends. He keeps pushing so I tell him again that watching him flirt with another girl had upset me. He immediately denies ever doing it, tells me I am just being insecure, and I need to stop ruining his night. I was stunned. Of course he did it, *I watched him do it.* When I start arguing back with him, he freaks out. He starts screaming at me about how he's so sick of my insecurities and negativity, how he cant do this anymore. He's sobbing and yelling non-stop, not letting me say anything to respond or try to calm him down. I keep asking him to please just wait until tomorrow to talk about this when he hadn't been drinking, but he keeps going on. He said some pretty terrible things, and kept telling me how much he didn't want to be with me. Even though I probably should've walked away at that point, I was worried about him. I let him yell and cry and vent at me and just tried to hug him.

&amp;#x200B;

He told me he didn't care about my bipolar disorder and that I need to grow up and get over myself because everyone has their own issues. He told me I have everything handed to me and I should be so lucky (even though I am working 3 jobs on top of being a full time college student). He told me he's going to be homeless because he doesn't have enough money to move back to his home state, and somehow convinced himself that his dad wouldn't take him back in (not true at all). He told me I'm not who he thought I was, and that he didn't care anymore. He broke my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually he fell asleep, and with no where else to go, so did I. I woke up this morning, talked with my best friend, and decided it was best for me to go a friends house for the night to let each other cool off. I text him where I was going and explained it was because I didn't trust my reactions to have such an important conversation when I felt so emotional. He told me I was just running away, and that my space is making him angrier because now he has to bottle his emotions. I told him I sorry he feels that way and I'd see him tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to go home, and I don't know what to do. Deep down I know there is no coming back from this for me, but the thought of losing him breaks my heart even more. I've been trying to think of what to say, but I don't know if it's going to matter if this conversation was anything like the last. I feel so overwhelmed, and I'm terrified of dealing with it. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with something when emotions are running so high?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Boyfriend flirts with girl right in front me, denies it, then has a complete drunken mental breakdown. Says he doesn't want to be with me anymore. I give us some space and it makes him angrier. I don't know if I can handle it."

Just found this subreddit and It’s my first time posting here. I’ll get straight to the point. There’s going to be a firm visit (Mazars NYC) at my college (CUNY-Hunter) this week, and I am not sure how to leave an impression. It’s going to be a panel discussion with audit and tax associates and an HR rep. I applied to one of their tax intern positions for next summer and I really want to use this event to increase my chances of getting an interview, at least.

I have a couple questions. 

First, if any of you guys have done campus recruiting, what do you look for? Most of the events I attended went like this: The panelists talk about their experiences and the firm and then the students ask a bunch of generic questions they already know the answer to or can find out just by looking it up on google. How can I get myself noticed? Is there any thoughtful questions I can ask? 

Second, should I bring my resume? I feel like I’m going to be one of very few people who do and the panelists don’t expect that, so it will be very awkward. 

You guys seem so helpful on this page and it would mean a lot to me if any of you can give me some advice or tips. Thanks!

9q1k54,61,2018-10-21,To my old IT internship boss.,einstein908,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9q1k54/to_my_old_it_internship_boss/,"From the day that I met you, I couldn't figure out what you had against me. I wasn't the only intern on our small, four-person team, but somehow you made me feel like I was the most unwelcomed. I noticed all those inside jokes you and my co-interns had, that you willingly left me out of. I noticed the awkward silence you left after I spoke up in meetings. I even chose not to be offended when you went out with my co-interns for lunch without me. 

There are a lot of things I wish I could have said to you then but in my insecurity, I blamed our struggling professional relationship on my own shortcomings. It wasn't until now, two years later, that I realized our issues had nothing to do with me. It had everything to do with you. 

As a woman in computer science I looked up to you. As a new developer and aspiring engineer, I respected you. That's why when you told me I wasn't a decent programmer, it cut me deeper than you'd imagine. In a world where women are already facing such a difficult time in the technology industry, why would you tear down another woman like that?

You told me at the end of our time together that you didn't think I'd excel in this industry. You shared with your bosses, my colleagues, that you thought programming was the wrong path for me. You told me I should pursue something easier, more fitting to my charismatic skillset.  You thought it was your job to choose my life and direction for me. But you were wrong. My only regret is not coming to this conclusion two years earlier. 

For months after our time together I struggled with the most insecurity I've ever had in my life. I asked everyone who could listen what they thought of my technical skill. I overextended myself studying and participating in programming competitions to sharpen my skills. I stopped telling jokes, I stopped speaking up in class, for fear my voice and humor might frighten away others. 

I regret ever giving you the power to determine how I felt about myself and where I fit into this world. 

Eight months ago I graduated college (a semester early) with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, against your advice. I immediately entered the workforce (at an incredible consulting company) as a Software Developer, against your advice. I continue to stand out as one of the most capable, young developers at my office. Since my time at my new job, I've tackled agile methodologies and learned at least four new frameworks well enough to code in fluently. I've been brought on to multiple projects as a ""powerhouse"" and knock out cards as quickly as they come in. 

The greatest thing about it all is that at my new job, people love and respect me. They've given me some of the greatest and most constructive  feedback I've ever recieved. I've learned, I've grown. And most importantly, I've moved on. I'm done questioning myself because of something you said two years ago. 

I am good enough and I refuse to let people like you define what I'm capable of and where I'm going. 

I pray for every young woman in technology that they will never have the displeasure of meeting you. Have a nice life. "
9q1lw2,5,2018-10-21,I’m not enjoying life.,b1pp0reddit,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/9q1lw2/im_not_enjoying_life/,"A brief history about me:

I lived in Paris for a year before coming to Washington state this summer. I despise it here. I moved to Paris in the latter half of the 8th grade, I am currently in 10th.

In Paris, I met a girl in Denmark, and, using my absolutely flawless courting abilities, flirted my way into a plane to Copenhagen. I don’t really know how to say this without it sounding strange, but we did the sex when I went to her house for the first time.

We continued to stay in a relationship for about 8 months - I had met her 7 times, an average of 3 days every rendez-vous. I fucked the whole thing up by going way too fast, she said she needed a break, I said fine.

In the length of that break, I hosted some fuckin amazing parties. I cannot tell you the absolute MAGNITUDE of these parties. It was me and 3 of my closest friends - excluding my on-break girlfriend. We smoked pot at these parties, and, on the second night of partying, I made what I now realize is a really regrettable decision and slept with one of my closest friends, a Parisian girl. I officially broke up with the Danish girl and refocused.

Then, at the end of the summer, the Parisian girl told me she just wanted to be friends; well really, her friend took her phone and told me that in the worst possible way. I, being one of the worst human beings alive, threatened self-harm. I cannot tell you how fucking awful I feel for even mentioning it or suggesting it. Eventually, through the course of a few months, we both came to terms that this couldn’t just be a friendship.

Fast forward to the end of summer in Washington - I’m talking to the Parisian, I’m drinking way too much, she’s drinking way too much. She asks me if I love her. I say yes. She says “not really maybe kinda”. 10 minutes pass. Another shot passes. She says she loves me. We’re technically in a relationship to this day.

Away from relationships for a second, focusing on school. I could relatively easily pass my classes in Paris. Actually, I was unsatisfied with most of my grades in Paris, but that didn’t stop me from procrastinating.

Now in Washington. My choice of school is B high; however, IL high has a super duper special gifted program, but you have to take a test - I take the test, I don’t pass. I send an appeal (like that would ever work). It worked. I got in. Everything is accelerated. I finish all of my studies a year before any regular high schooler would; my senior year I don’t even have to show up for school, I can just dedicate it to intern work.

This school is hard. This school is really really fucking difficult. Work consumes most of my time. I can’t call the Parisian anymore because I’ve either got work or she’s asleep. I didn’t even text her on her birthday. I DIDN’T EVEN TEXT HER ON HER BIRTHDAY.

A few weeks ago. I’m calling the Danish girl on my bus to and from school; she stays awake until 4:30 am to talk to me. We didn’t talk for a long time because we both said some fucked up shit in the breakup. There’s clearly some tension every time we talk now. One day, I’m whispering a 20 page long report on the Israeli-Palestinian crisis that I wrote to her as she falls asleep. I ask her if she’s still awake. She says that every time she hears me say another word she realizes how much she misses me. I reply that I regret breaking up with her. She says she loves me. I say I love her back.

My grades are horrendous - 1 A, 2 Ds, and the rest are Bs. I understand all of the homework and coursework for every class I take, but then the test fucks me in the ass; or should I say, I always fuck myself in the ass with stupid, easily avoidable mistakes. Doing my homework just feels pointless.

Here comes the worst part - my age. I usually don’t tell people this until they know me really well, because when they know they stay away from me because of their own predilections.

I’m 13. I skipped 2 grades, and am in the gifted program. I usually tell people I’m 16 until they know me well. I’m tall, I have a fairly deep voice, puberty hit me early, so it works. People just think I’m a little immature for 16.

My age might make everything I just said implausible, but it’s true. Please help me.

I wish I was a bird. Nobody expects you to get good grades and go to bird university. Nobody expects you to ace your fucking bird calculus classes. Birds enjoy life."

Work has always been his #1 and it finally paid back his devotion with an early death. A heart attack seemed to be the cause we were told. He passed quietly at his desk after another late night in the office. My mother and I went to gather his things today and I found this letter tucked away under some things on his desk. I want to say before I share it that my dad did not like pranks and he was not a fan of horror or the supernatural. I have no idea why he wrote this, but I need answers. Please, if you have any idea of what really happened to my dad, I have to know.

---

Ninety-seven. That’s how many days it’s been since the first time I came back to work. That’s how many days it’s been since I’ve seen my wife and son. That’s how many days it’s been since I’ve encountered another living human being. I don’t know how much longer I can keep going on like this, therefore I am writing this so that if anyone ever finds me, my family will know what happened to me.  

It started on a Monday in March. I’ve gone over the events of that day so many times in my head, regretting every moment of it. That morning, as usual, Kyle wouldn’t get out of bed and I yelled and screamed at him about making me late for work. Val tried calming me down and was in the middle of saying I needed to go a bit easier on him when I snapped at her that she should either help get his lazy ass out of bed or shut up.

That hurt look in her eyes is the last memory I have of her. Just remembering it breaks my fucking heart and it’s the reason I’ve been able to keep going for this long, because I can’t let it be her last memory of me. She walked away and I stormed out of the house so I wouldn’t be late for my stupid fucking job that I always put before the things that really should have mattered to me.  

I got to my office in no better mood than I had been in when I left the house. Karen offered me a cheerful greeting and a fresh coffee and I answered her coldly, “I sure hope you have the contracts for the new project on my desk.” God, I was such a dick. I see Karen now and wish I could apologize, but all that’s left is her tattered floral blouse draped around her skeletal remains.  

My day was filled with meetings that I gave more importance than they deserved and between them I managed to squeeze in enough time to emotionally abuse more than one of the new interns, all of whom are now skeletons piled in the northern corner of the main conference room. I remember how excited they were on their first day, but I sure as hell had quickly put an end to that.  

The work day ends at 5:30, but it was already past seven when Karen came in and asked if she could head home for the day, I think she told me it was someone’s birthday, maybe her son? As you can tell, I really cared about the lives of the people with whom I worked. “Absolutely not. Do you see me leaving yet? Are you saying your job is so unimportant that I won’t miss you if you’re gone?” I had snarled the words at her. Her head dropped and she shuffled back to her desk looking absolutely dejected.  

Just past 9 o’clock I finally decided to call it a day. Karen was still at her desk and I completely ignored her and headed for the door. Maybe if I’d paid attention I would have known then that something was wrong, or maybe not, maybe everything was still normal at that point, but either way, I hadn’t even looked in her direction so I’ll never know. I went out to the parking garage, got in my car, and that was the first time I left work.  

I’d driven the 45 minutes it takes to get home, waited for the garage door to open, pulled in, turned off the ignition, got out of the car, and realized I was back in the parking garage.  

It couldn’t be dementia, I told myself, I wasn’t that old yet. I had definitely arrived at home but I sure as shit wasn’t there now. My breathing sped up and I was starting to panic. I sat back down in the car, took a deep breath, and decided I must have dozed off when I got in the car and simply dreamt that I’d driven home. That made the most sense, it was no big deal, I’d just head home for real this time and laugh about it when I told Val later.  

As the sun rose that morning, I finally gave up on trying to drive home. I’d driven to my house and found myself back in the parking garage upon exiting my vehicle six times and I was almost out of gas. At one point I tried stopping at a gas station, but I’d simply been back at work when I got out at the pump.  

The rest of that day I spent trying to walk home. My office was at the end of its own street that branched off the main road about a mile away. I could make it to the main road, but once I turned onto it and walked a ways, I’d be walking back down the street toward my office. Eventually, I tried walking in a straight line through the woods behind the building, but every time I found myself back where I’d started about half an hour later.  

It was at that point I finally thought of Karen who had still been at her desk when I left the previous night. I had no idea if she’d managed to get out of the office or not, but I felt like an idiot for not thinking to check for people inside sooner. The relief I had felt when I first saw her sitting at her desk quickly faded when I saw how blue her face was. I checked for a pulse but there was none, she had most likely been dead the entire day.  

I was surprised to find everyone was still in the office, sitting at their desks or in conference rooms, but all of them were in the same state as Karen. I tried every device I could find that might be able to communicate with the outside world but nothing would turn on. Not the monitors, the computers, the cellphones, nothing. There was no way to call for help or even let anyone know where I was.  

The things I did on my last normal day will always haunt me, but I can’t say I’ve done any better in the months I’ve been trapped here. I was forced to accept the fact there was no way to contact the outside world and I collapsed in a corner of my office and sobbed. What felt like days went by while I stared at the wall, too numb to move or think. It was the hunger that finally roused me from my catatonic state. The building has a kitchen, but it is not stocked and there were only a few forgotten lunches that might last me a few days. It wasn’t long until I got desperate.  

It wasn’t by natural means that my colleagues became fleshless skeletons. Being the monster that I am, I have survived this long by feasting on the rancid meat from the bodies of the ones with whom I used to work. Karen was first, then the interns, the executive team, and then I made my way from desk to desk, floor to floor. Someone must survive I told myself while desecrating the remains of the deceased for my own selfish desire to stay alive. I would beg God’s mercy but I know there is no longer forgiveness for me.  

Sanity is a fragile thing and I have felt mine cracking and breaking away for a while now. This letter may be my last rational act before madness and then hopefully death take me. I love you Val. I love you Kyle. I am so sorry I couldn’t have been a better husband and father and I can only pray the world outside my office is still ok and that you find better lives without me.  

May the world at least do my family the kindness of allowing these words to reach them.

From a broken man,

She‘s an intern at the company I am working at. We immediatly hit it off, but I was in a failing realitionship at the time and therefore waited for closure there before approaching her a few weeks ago, now being single again.

I asked her out, only to learn that she has a boyfriend of three years and is very unhappy with the relationship, to the point where they decided to open it up out of desperation. She feels emotionally and sexually neglected.

At first it seemed to only be the sex that was the issue for them. Me being much more sexually experienced than her (she has only been with her boyfriend before). So we hooked up, but due to performance issues did not go through with it. Instead we spent an amazing movie night together. But now we are at the point where we text for hours every day and talk on the phone alot. Last time she stayed over, we finally had sex, cuddled together and fell asleep holding hands. It basically feels like we are on the road to a relationship already.

I feel like I finally found one of those soul mates people talk about. Our chemistry is amazing, and every second we spend together is brightened by laughter and warmth. It feels so natural.

Yet she still has her partner. But from everything I can tell, she is also falling for me hard, wanting to meet up again, holding my hand, always initiating conversations. And I don‘t know what to do. It hurts me that we can‘t spend more time together. Maybe I talk crazy right now and she is just using me for emotional support and sex. Maybe I should cut contact or tell her to make up her mind before I get hurt too much.

I already turned to one night stands with different girls a few times (with her knowing, of course) to keep my mind off her, but that obviously did not work. So it is not just about the sex.

As I have no one else to talk to about this, I am turning to you. Thank you for reading this.

TLDR: I am falling for my fwb, and she seems to be feeling the same way, yet she is still in a relationship."

9q39vj,3,2018-10-21,AITA for inviting a friend to a gig that a mutual friend flaked on?,1020401thrw,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9q39vj/aita_for_inviting_a_friend_to_a_gig_that_a_mutual/,"FTP, hope I'm doing this right! Also fair warning, this is a long-ish story and kind of petty. TL;DR at bottom, screenshots peppered throughout.

So I have two friends from high school that I keep in touch with regularly, we all do the same course at different universities. I go to uni in a major city in England, whereas F1 and F2 go to different unis in the country we're all from. This year is our placement year, where we go and work for 12 months before going back to uni for our final year. I got a placement at a company based near London, and F1 and F2 both got placements in the same city back home.

Before I moved to London, tickets went on sale for an artist that I was a big fan of at a London gay club, and I bought a ticket for myself, figuring I could find some other people online I could go with. A few weeks later F1 was told that her company was placing her in their London office, and she reasonably freaked slightly - she had just moved into a flat with one of her coursemates and it would be a major PITA to move out. But everything got sorted and she moved to London not long after me, and her company paid for her flights home every weekend.

I then got the idea that she could come with me to the gig, considering she knew nobody in London and her office skewed slightly older. She was having a pretty rough time because she's super extroverted and hates missing out on things, so when I asked her she was up for it.

We met up a couple of times over the next month or two. I would [remind her](https://i.imgur.com/wnwHn37.jpg) about the gig, she would say something like ""Oh yeah I need to remember to sort that!"" and nothing would ever come of it.

(Side note - sorry if the messages are hard to understand, we've sort of developed our own way of talking to each other after ~4 years of shitposting lmao)

So a couple weeks before the gig, I asked her again about the tickets, and [she told me](https://i.imgur.com/F9u46kV.jpg) that she was trying to organise her uni friends to come over to London that weekend. I felt [let down](https://i.imgur.com/4wbMp3L.jpg) that she would blatantly ditch me for other friends when she had agreed to go with me, she said it was fine because I bought the tickets expecting to go alone anyway. She mentioned that [she lives by herself](https://i.imgur.com/RFKnxsS.jpg) (I live with a family my family is friends with, who are from the same crazy evangelical Christian church I grew up in, hence the affectionate ""cult"" nickname) and she's been having trouble not seeing her boyfriend as much - despite the fact that she sees him every weekend when she goes home. At this point I was over talking about it, didn't want to fight and I had work to get on with so I ended the conversation there.

That night I was talking to F2 about everything and apparently he had money to burn bc he made plans to visit for the weekend and come to the gig pretty much that night, which was amazing and totally unexpected but I was really happy to not go on my own.

The company I work for has a pretty tight-knit group of grads and interns and I mentioned it at lunch the next day, and a few people seemed interested in going - so, tickets were booked over the next couple of weeks and we had a squad going. Yay, everything worked out!

Except it didn't. A week before the gig I was flying home for a one-off weekend with my family and F1 happened to be on the same flight. By that point things were mostly back to normal, no hard feelings, no love lost. I mentioned that I had a group of grads coming with me to the gig and that F2 was coming for the weekend, and F1 was glad I had something organised. She mentioned that she was having trouble organising her friends to come over that weekend and I said the offer was still open for her to come if it didn't work out.

3 days before the gig, I messaged her again to say that if she wanted to come she could, but she said she had [organised her weekend trip home](https://i.imgur.com/qZBN4Qe.jpg) and couldn't make it. Fair enough, it sucked that it didn't work out but that's life.

Gig day came, I took a half day off work to meet F2, there was a mixup with tube stations and I sent a vid to the group chat of F2 looking slightly lost from the other side of a road. F1 replied ""Is F2 in London i am confusion""  and I said ""yes"". Then F1 said if she knew she would have sorted something out so we [could have a reunion](https://i.imgur.com/nfrjwmr.jpg). I said that I was sure I told her in person, she said that I didn't, and then proceeded to [guilt trip me](https://i.imgur.com/q63ZvAc.jpg).

Anyway, the gig was amazing, 10/10 would lose my shit again, but I spent most of my time before it started questioning whether I told F1 that F2 was coming or not, whether it's justified for me to be angry, and basically, whether I'm an asshole.

Sorry for how ridiculously convoluted and petty this whole thing is, but the entire timeline of events is kind of spread out so I hope everything makes sense! But yeah, I just want to know if I'm in the wrong here? Thanks.

**TL;DR**  - Invited a friend (F1) to a gig, she accepted then made plans for the same weekend with other friends. Mutual friend of ours (F2) offered to go instead, F1's friends cancelled on her, F1 got pissed that we made plans without her and idk if I'm an asshole."

I have several internship offers, but I am struggling between two different companies. 

One of them is a very large industrial supplier that is business to business. They provide housing, have a large ~90 interning class, and I would be focused with industrial supply chain &amp; global supply chain. I visited the corporate headquarters and really enjoyed everything about it. They have a gym, a lot of new faces, and it has a great atmosphere-- also a good cafeteria. 
It is located near chicago. 


The other is another very large industrial company. I would be in Wisconsin, and I have not visited. I got a great vibe from this company as well and really enjoyed my interviews. they focus on equipment rather than supply chain, but because of their focus I would be a Production control analyst intern. This seems more like a local branch, but is located with Operations/Engineering rather than strictly supply chain. 

The first company has a mix of supply chain, and engineering. I think that I would be one of the few engineering students along with a couple of friends. The second company would be more engineering focused. 

Company A pays around 21.

Company B pays around 26.  

Having a tough time deciding. Only have a couple days left for one offer. 

I need advice in this situation. "
9q4lgp,1,2018-10-21,"This isn't the first time I've moved somewhere new, so it doesn't make sense as to why I feel like this.",noisuchin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9q4lgp/this_isnt_the_first_time_ive_moved_somewhere_new/,"I'm going through a rough time, and it's one of those things where it feels bad now, but if things don't start getting better soon, I can see myself getting way, way worse.

Me at present, I'm 22, fresh out of my undergrad, and I'm currently in my first semester of grad school in an exciting city I've never lived in before. It's my dream school, and it helped me land a killer paid internship that I can't imagine getting without some help. I'm studying a field that I didn't touch in my undergrad and that I've always been interested in, and to me that feels like a dream. I'm not completely alone. I'm a nervous extrovert, so I've already made some friends.

So, really, I hate myself for being unhappy in this situation.

This is going to be a rushed explanation, but I'll do my best to be fluid and cohesive. In my childhood and throughout my adolescence, I always changed schools, so I never built up a consistent friend group, and as the only person of color in my predominantly white neighborhood, I always felt outed. And then, on the larger end of my life, there was something mentally wrong with me. No one knew what it was until my church's teen confirmation retreat, where I had my first, and thankfully so far only, manic depressive episode. When I was sixteen, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with bipolar disorder. So, when I left the hospital, I was alone more than ever. My parish ostracized me, and I had to change schools again. At my final school before my undergrad, I was somewhat able to make friends, but I was a drifter. It's hard for a transfer student to root themselves, especially if they're coming in the middle of the school year. I hated all of it, the life I was given. And anyway, I've always hated where I'd grown up, so that was also terrible.

It was when I applied to my colleges that I decided I wanted to go somewhere new and have a new life where no one knew me. I applied everywhere outside of my state, and it was in the Northwest where I found my new home.

Within the past four years, I built up a solid friend group and even made friends outside of it. I had a boyfriend and a few flings, and though none of them lasted, the me prior to college never would have thought that anyone ever would want to be with me. The place where I lived wasn't glamorous. It wasn't the big city that I had grown up in, but I grew to love it. I felt loved and even in the moments where I felt hated, at least it felt like a normal hatred. I was fine because it wasn't the me with the disorder that they hated; in the love and hatred, it was always about the genuine me. 

I miss it. I miss it so, so much, and I miss my friends. I know I can build up what I had because I'm actually pretty good at making friends, but it's not the same. It's not even to the extent that I would want it right now.

When I left my hometown, I never looked back. I felt no homesickness, save for my family, but with the place where I spent my undergrad, it was there for the first time that I felt like a real person.

This post doesn't do my feelings justice, to be honest. I'm just in pain, in mourning. I loved all of my friends, and I still do. I keep thinking I'm on a study abroad deal and that in six months or a year, I'll be back, but the worst part of it is that it was my college town. There's really no excuse for me to fly back there, at least not for a while. I want my feelings to stop. I want to be able to move forward in the city where I will most likely settle in. I want to be able to focus on my studies without feeling so depressed that I can't go on. The only thing that I really have going for me is that I'm going to a boxing gym now, but it feels like the moment I leave the gym, I'm back to dealing with my issues.

It's also insanely hard to find therapists and psychiatrists in this city, and I'm running out of my prescription from my previous psychiatrist. Sometimes I just think it would be easier to end it, but I don't know if that would be the right thing to do. I'm just stuck with this feelings. I'm stuck with the loss of what I feel like was the peak of my life, and the frustrating part is that I never felt this way when I left my hometown. Four years ago I felt invincible, that I could do anything, that I could shape the life I had always wanted. Well, I succeeded. But that was then and this is now, and right now I feel like a loser. An ungrateful loser."

The doc said it helps with the depression and the attention at the same time but I feel like it helps neither. I feel like the pills have no effect on me whatsoever. I'm still sad and inattentive, and I still constantly forget everything all the time. I'm currently waiting for 1 week on this drug to 100% make sure it is not effective enough. I'm on the 5th day now.

&amp;#x200B;

It is very irritating to request people to slow down their speech and give me some time to think what they have just said. Sometimes even that doesn't help, I look very focused on the outside but I am actually instantly forgetting whatever the person in front of me is talking about. Social anxiety doesn't help on this either. I sometimes become too anxious that I refrain from asking people to be more concise. I'm constantly afraid that if I do that people will get annoyed and stop talking to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm occasionally plotting on suicide, like actual step by step planning. I don't think I will ever do it, but I can't refrain myself from thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

The inability to start on doing anything is pulling me behind on everything. I'm not in a good college because I failed considerably on University Placement exams. I'm not doing good in my current college either because I am constantly postponing homeworks and studies, procrastinating, etc. I need to find a summer internship now and I have no motivation to even fire up my CV to random companies.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even take my time off from college until I get the perfect treatment/medication, either. Because I would still have to pay 50% tuition, or quit completely and lose all the credits I gained up to this point. My parents aren't the richest, unfortunately, so I doubt we can afford either of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I always dreamed of immigrating to a better country, but considering I have to force myself to do daily things like eating, getting out of bed, brushing my teeth... I can't see how I can accomplish anything significant that would make me be able to immigrate.

&amp;#x200B;

And it seems like it is getting even worse. I only have one person that I can speak to sincerely, and I feel like talking to her everyday about my problems is starting to get her annoyed at me. The worst of them all is I feel like I have to hide these problems from other people, because I will be seen as a freak and lose respect of others. I live in a country where they constantly make fun of people with depression and other mental probems.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text, I just felt like I needed to get these out of my chest. I hope everything gets better for all of us."

9q6ebj,0,2018-10-21,Need some help deciding between offers,cycloalkane,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/9q6ebj/need_some_help_deciding_between_offers/,"Hi everyone, I'm currently a junior and after not being able to get an actuarial internship last year, I've finally been able to get some offers this year, which I am very thankful for. 

I'm not really sure what information is a good idea to post, but I'll try to give as much as I can. Anyway, I have an offer from Company A and Company B. Company A is located in a relatively small city in Illinois, and Company B is located in a bigger city in Texas. Company A pays $5/hr less than Company B, but Company A is one of the biggest insurance companies in the United States and more well known. The position at Company A is in pricing insurance, and the position at Company B is in health insurance. 

Here are a few reasons why I'm having a hard time choosing. Company B is enticing because of the higher wage and I think the location is a nicer place to live. I didn't get an internship last year, so it'll be harder to get a full time position. Thus, I think it would be great to get a return offer. Since Company B's intern salary is higher, I imagine the full time salary would also be higher. 

On the other hand, Company A is a bigger company. The interview process was a lot more extensive and I got to learn a lot more about it. It seems to be better structured and I feel like it gives a better experience for interns than Company B. For example, we get  three mentors to talk to, and I also think that the chance of getting an uninteresting project is lower at Company A. Company A is a more well known company, so it might be possible that the ""prestige"" is higher. Should that be a relevant factor when deciding between offer? Does it help in getting a full time job? Finally, the cost of living for Company A is quite a bit less than the cost of living for Company B, so that helps offset the difference in cost a bit.

I don't really have a preference for property vs health insurance, and I think both are good to get some experience doing. 

I would really appreciate any suggestions you guys have!"

Because I'm not a clinician, I can't tell if she has made the right call. But, I felt really hurt and hopeless. Can a clinician give their opinion on this? The therapist is a Ph.D student under supervision.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a senior at university, and I sought counseling at school because I am having a lot of anxiety over the life transition I am about to experience. I have been unsure about a career path, but basically had it narrowed down, and I have also been struggling in my long-term relationship. I have a wonderful boyfriend who is securely attached, and he treats me so well. Before being with him, I consistently dated guys who were avoidantly attached and found myself in a year long relationship with a guy who was really emotionally abusive. I grew up in an unstable home with a controlling step-father. I basically woke up one day and questioned my entire healthy relationship after being happy for 2 years. It has been extremely stressful for me because he has been the one person in my life who is always supportive and loving. So, what has changed? 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the problem is that I try hard in school and do well, but he is disinterested in school. When he doesn't know how to do something, he just doesn't do anything at all. He drops a lot of his classes, wouldn't apply for internships or jobs even after I helped him find several opportunities, and is basically paralyzed by his fear of failure. However, he has made significant improvement recently. But, our relationship was really damaged when I told him I was bothered by his lack of discipline. We are also just different...I am a deep thinker and want to have intellectual conversations and he wants to talk about his love for basketball. We try really hard to engage with each other, but we do have completely different interests. I'm not sure if I have found reasons to push him away or if these are legitimate reasons for there to be distance between us, but I'm not okay with it because I want to be with him. He's my best friend and he has an incredibly pure heart.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the first session I got a weird vibe immediately. I have been in short-term therapy once before at another institution and had a really positive experience. My therapist was warm, understanding, and really ""got me."" I felt like this therapist was trying to emulate the warmth of a therapist but was not actually warm. It felt phony. When she asked why I came to counseling, I told her I was not feeling solid about a career path, I have always struggled to make friends, and I was having problems with my previously happy and stable relationship. I didn't get to tell her about the issues with my boyfriend because she suggested I go to group therapy to address interpersonal issues and that she wanted to focus on the career issue in individual counseling. I really wanted to address the issues with my boyfriend, but I agreed because the career thing also felt really pertinent. I was surprised by how uncomfortable I felt telling her my problems because I felt like she was disingenuous, but I tried to push through because I was like, ""She's a therapist. She's here because she cares about people and wants to help them through things like the ones I'm going through.""

&amp;#x200B;

I was nervous to go to the second session because of how awkward and judged I felt the first time. I hadn't seen her in 2 weeks, but in that time had talked to more people in the career field I'm interested in, and I was feeling a lot better in that realm of my life. I explained this to her and said, ""But, now that that anxiety has been cast away, it has shifted to worrying about problems with my boyfriend. I really want to address that part of my life because it is a big source of my anxiety."" She seemed irritated and said, ""Well, okay. I hear you, but we had a plan, and that was to address the career issue."" She went onto explain that it was unethical for her to work on interpersonal issues in individual counseling since I was also in group therapy (she is not a clinician for group therapy, only my individual counseling). She said because I had only been to 2 group counseling sessions, it was impossible to understand the benefits of group counseling at this point. I explained that I enjoyed what group counseling has offered so far because I felt less alone and more confident approaching friendships, but I wasn't sure how it would help me move forward with all of the complex factors that could be contributing to the problems I'm having in my relationship. So far, group counseling has been a lot of sharing and supporting each other, which I need, but I don't see how it is going to help me understand what's going on in my relationship. Of course, I am not a clinician so I don't know the expected outcomes of group counseling.

&amp;#x200B;

I started crying, and I'm not really a crier, and I wasn't crying because I had a therapeutic breakthrough. We were going back and forth, and I felt like everything I said was negated with ""But, there's probably a parallel between the problems you're experiencing in your relationship and why you're not willing to give group therapy a shot at addressing the problems in your relationship."" I really felt like I needed help, and she wasn't willing to do it. I felt like I was being argued with, talked down to, etc. I felt stuck without a way out. I felt uncomfortable crying in front of her because I felt like she didn't actually want to help me. It didn't feel like a safe space to cry. She told me, ""Well, maybe next time you can try harder in group therapy...I mean, not try harder...um, go in with full intentions."" Overall, I just felt judged, hurt, and alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I crazy? Is she right? Does this mean I should be in group counseling to address my relationship problems?

*disclaimer: I am an adult that is over 18 in search of other adults that are 18+ for fantasy play*

I am absolutely turned on by all kinds of forbidden relationships. Please read to the end. I had lots of fun with this yesterday. 

Think about how many different types exist: teacher/student, boss/secretary, coach/player, father/daughter, the possibilities are almost endless. Today, I have a few scenarios to offer: 

New) The Yoga Instructor - I’d play any number of roles - brother, boyfriend’s Dad, best friend’s boyfriend, teacher, whoever, that walks in unexpectedly to your yoga class (or a class where you are a yoga student) and it turns out I need some extra help, which you are generous enough to offer.

1. You're a new intern in the office, and a bit younger than usual. But that's okay. Trial by fire isn't going to be difficult for you, with a body like that, you've definitely been treated like an adult before. But just wait until you see how I'm going to treat you like you're grown. 
2. We've always had a good relationship as teacher/student. When you join my club and we start to spend more time together, things spiral quite quickly into a mutual affair.
3. We're vacationing in a ski cabin in the Rockies when your mother, my wife (can be step-father or actual father), gets called back to the city on business. I've had my eye on you for about a year. How nice it is to have my own little snow bunny to myself.
4. It's Wedding time, and you're a bridesmaid. A good ole cliche.
5. So many more scenarios. What's on your mind? I’m definitely open to variations on a theme of any of these.
6. I’m also open to chatting about why these scenarios are so hot.

My limits are simple: Feet, Bathroom, Gore

My kinks: Seduction, Dirty Talk, Big Cocks, Cum Play, Lingerie, Reluctance to Enjoyment, Eating Pussy, Blowjobs, Multiple Orgasms, and so much more.

Please be able to put a sentence together while playing. I'm open to playing with a guy that can play a female convincingly.

Hope to chat soon.

9q7wcw,33,2018-10-21,"Laurel's Plot, Revisited",KarasEstates,htgawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/htgawm/comments/9q7wcw/laurels_plot_revisited/,"ETA This is a long theory. You probably don't want to read this on your phone 😁




All right...I got all of these theories out of my system. Do I know this is how it'll play out vs being continuity errors or if it's a thing or not? Nope but the evidence is there and real...what they ultimately do with it remains to be seen.

&amp;nbsp;

Why have I spent so much time delving into this in a more serious manner? Because it's a kick ass series and I found a real trail and can't let it alone. I started season 5 and it got up in me again ;-p

&amp;nbsp;

The up side is that now I got these out of my system I can try to watch and enjoy what happens from here to see if there is any meat to it or if it's just a herring.

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR - okay, don't read it then. It's more for me than you anyway but it's relevant for those of us approaching this as trying to figure out WTF before they reveal it...


&amp;nbsp;

This is the full evidence trail showing just how deceptive Laurel has been about her true agenda.


**Season 4 - Episode 2 - I'm Not Her**

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel begins googling information on Antares Technologies. She puts in tax evasion, anti trust violations, fraud, malfeasance, off shore shell companies, and absolutely nothing comes back and instead, the results are seeded with links to articles showing Antares doing good, helping the government, shaping policy for the better. Laurel's getting frustrated because google didn't hand her anything she could use against her father. 

&amp;nbsp;

Pro Laurel camp may contend that AT clearly scrubbed the web of all unflattering material. Fair point, however, so far there is no evidence that ever happened. Until there is, Jorge and AT gets the benefit of the doubt: AT is a strong ""google"" like company (don't even...it's an example!) and isn't funding terrorism, drug cartels (though Jorge might be engaging in some funny business up in the Ozarks...)

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel decides that she wants to work for Caplan &amp; Gold - citing their good work and not mentioning anything regarding AT. When the callbacks happened, Michaela and Asher get in and Laurel does not. 

&amp;nbsp;

She misses her callback with a lower level firm to continue googling crap on AT and finds some article about a mysterious death of an Antares employee, Trent Stockton...

&amp;nbsp;

A little later in the same episode Connor visits Laurel at Wes' apartment she's taken over and he is trying to make some amends. He says he gets it, she's trying to find out what happened to Wes. Laurel tells him to not say Wes' name. He then points out that she's having Wes' baby.

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel snaps back, and I quote: ""NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT THIS STUPID BABY""

&amp;nbsp;

Wrapping up, we learn Simon &amp; Michaela also got on at C&amp;G.

&amp;nbsp;

Having been vaguely interested in Michaela since the beginning, suddenly Laurel chums up to her and tells her C&amp;G represents AT...and then tells her she won't make a call to get on herself because ""he killed Wes.""

&amp;nbsp;

No proof, no evidence...just Laurel plotting and scheming. She doesn't even offer Michaela any evidence, just her word in and of itself...and ""you're gonna help me take him down.""

&amp;nbsp;

**4-3: It's For The Greater Good**

&amp;nbsp;

Michaela isn't having any part of that plan...and Laurel pressures her to do it anyway. The entirety of Laurel's plan is this: just access the Antares File and find some illegal activity they can leak to the SEC or FBI. Mind you - she hasn't a shred of proof or evidence, she's on a fishing expedition and pushing Michaela to jeapordize her new job to dig into the files just to see IF there is anything illegal Laurel can use against Jorge, on her simple accusation he killed Wes...and, recall, not everything's about this stupid baby.

&amp;nbsp;

Michaela: And where's your evidence? (Jorge killed Wes)

Laurel: I'm trying to get it, that's what I'm trying to get! 

&amp;nbsp;

Really? And Jorge would have evidence implicating him in murdering Wes Gibbons hidden in his Antares files at his lawyer's firm? Does that truly make any sense?

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel continues with the claim the ""evidence"" is her whole life, her father's a terrible person, done bad things her whole life and he needs to go do jail. And by season 5 this flaky bitch has everyone, fans included, believing Jorge killed Wes...it's all HER STORY. Nobody else's. 


&amp;nbsp;

Oliver discovers Bonnie's working for Denver and the group questions her loyalties. But Asher spills the beans about Frank and Bonnie living together...so Laurel goes to see Bonnie to ask for an intern job at the DA's office and it's not, as she claimed, because her GPA sucks and she's pregnant. Bonnie says no and runs her off.

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel then goes to Frank. Soon as Frank reveals he wanted to call and asks if he's wrong, Laurel dodges answering and goes right into needing him to convince Bonnie to hire her as an intern.
 She reminds him he was right what he said about her when they first met - she'd give up her career to become a mom...yet her actions show she really doesn't want to do that (over this stupid baby, of course). Frank does persuade Bonnie to hire her though, bringing up feels that she's pregnant with the dead puppy's baby...can't kick her to the curb, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Now.......ask yourself as you move along the series. Is it possible that Laurel planted files on all of them (except hers! &lt;-----) or provided them to Denver later? Rewatch and pay attention to what she does. She tolerates Asher. She's annoyed Connor drops out of law school. She's annoyed Michaela isn't biting. Bonnie wouldn't bite...Laurel is plotting and doing her best to find any leverage or advantage she can with a group that doesn't see her as that effective. How she must resent that shit, yeah?

&amp;nbsp;


She visits Michaela bearing ""proof""...and I quote: ""I got access to the FAAs flight logs at the DAs office"" 
and presents a document with a yellow highlighted bar and tells Michaela this is her father's jet that landed in Phillie - and I quote, ""the day Wes died"" (but wasn't it at night, in a fire?) ...and Dominic was probably on it. Michaela glances - this isn't her area of expertise...therefore it's not scrutinized for any hard evidence of anything. Just something Laurel can wave at her that sounds like it's suspicious at face value. Tells her to go back in there and ""win this, for Wes""...

&amp;nbsp;

And she offered the answer regarding her father's smallest office in Rwanda that just happens to be a question that Michaela can win...which gives her the access to do what Laurel wants her to do. 

&amp;nbsp;

Michaela isn't going to dig into this to even corroborate it - she's going to do with most people did - take Laurel's tearful pleas as truth and run with it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Again, Jorge's plane in Phillie has no direct connection to Wes or his murder. And really, what kind of a dumb ass paper trail would that be? Still, the point here is that Laurel is desperate to find something illegal and keeps coming up empty. She has zero evidence - according to her - that Jorge killed Wes or had him killed. Her evidence was all about her life. She uses being pregnant to get a job, get sympathy, get people to do what she wants while she pulls the strings from outside the puppetshow.

&amp;nbsp;

Michaela is the one who is at risk. Bonnie is the one who is at risk. Eventually, she manipulates all of them to put themselves at risk on a claim without a shred of evidence ever presented that Jorge did anything at all. And Denver ends up with ""files"" on all of them...enough to take them all down one by one. 

&amp;nbsp;

One curious possible clue...Michaela feels confident enough to just flat out tell Tegan she wants to work for her, flatters her and would kill to work on any of her accounts, Antares for example. Tegan says okay and ""Your funeral..."" which is the title of the first episode of S5 introducing Gabriel who says this to Frank when he steps up for some Bball. 

Connection? Coincidence?

&amp;nbsp;

**S4 - 4: Was She Ever Good At Her Job?**

&amp;nbsp;

Next we see Laurel, we see this face...


[Screen-Shot-10-20-18-at-12-06-PM.png](https://postimg.cc/nX8g9QQD)


and this crackpot shit here...

[Screen-Shot-10-20-18-at-12-07-PM.png](https://postimg.cc/kVTTsVDw)

&amp;nbsp;

This is the episode Laurel drools over Asher and points out her OB took her off antidepressants. OB's don't prescribe antidepressants to pregnant women as a rule. However, if that is the case then coming off those had the equal potential effect of dredging up nutjob obsessive, manic needs to draw crazy shit during class.

&amp;nbsp;



Michaela says she can't access anything because the system logs it all. So Laurel flatters her into it. A little later Laurel protests that Denver covered up Wes' murder...and has yet another level of claims to the mix she tells them later.

&amp;nbsp;

She blows off work, pissing Bonnie off, and goes to see Frank...who compliments her on making an awesome mom, to which she replied, and I quote: ""Can we not talk about the baby? Please?"" And then she makes a move on Frank...""it's just sex""...

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel is digging through stuff on Denver and sees Trent Stockton as a donor. So Laurel has her link. She tells Michaela that her father is funneling money to pay off Denver for covering up Wes' murder using a dead man mysteriously donating funds to Denver. While that sounds all fine - there is still no actual evidence. It's just Laurel piling on stuff she knows - like we all know - Michaela isn't actually going to look into or corroborate. She's taking Laurel at her word alone.

&amp;nbsp;

The one doing this shit here in class...

[Screen-Shot-10-20-18-at-12-05-PM.png](https://postimg.cc/DSpTJznk)

&amp;nbsp;


Laurel even goes so far as suggesting Michaela start having sex with the IT guy...but Michaela comes up with her own plan which appears to surprise Laurel but who runs with it...the plan being to now implicate Oliver on an IT emergency.


&amp;nbsp;

**S4 - 5: I Love Her**

&amp;nbsp;

Oliver flat tells Michaela he can't and shouldn't. But he does and when they get into the AT files the one on Trent Stockton is a cease &amp; desist letter with a timer that nearly gets them busted. Oliver deflects Simon who basically catches them. Laurel's hitting on Frank for sex but he blows her off in favor of trying to find out if she's sure the baby's not his - and that's why he's doing all this. Laurel flips out and runs him off. Frank's confused. Laurel requests a paternity test though to be sure.

&amp;nbsp;

Jorge appears for an emergency meeting and Michaela thinks they've been found out. Instead, Jorge has ordered all the security batches to be replaced. 

&amp;nbsp;

Jorge meets with Laurel and tells her she's about to be really rich - her children's children will never have to worry about anything else ever again and tells her Antares is going public. Meanwhile, Tegan tells Michaela in confidence that any bad press before the announcement can tank the deal...but if it goes well, they're all going to be rich.

&amp;nbsp;

NOW............

&amp;nbsp;

Jorge hands Laurel a document that shows he transferred 10% of the shares into her name (and her brother's) before the offering and she says she can't have any of his shady shit blowing back on her. He tells her not to worry, he's taken care of anything that could've come up. (No, Wes isn't one...don't infer) as Laurel later tells Michaela and Oliver Antares going public is why Jorge killed Wes...cause Denver had files on them and Wes was intending to cut a deal and implicate them all in Sam's murder, Rebecca, Sinclair, all of the stuff...when Wes was intending to help Denver take down AK.

&amp;nbsp;

But go back and watch 1, 2 and 3...because that's not entirely what was taking place. Plus, Wes did not seek any deal on Laurel's behalf. There were easier ways to keep that from happening that didn't involve a homicide...so again, please rewatch for how this actually went down and it should be a little easier to see there's been no actual evidence implicating Jorge in Wes' life or his death and going public wasn't at stake at the time.

&amp;nbsp;


He signed an immunity deal but Wes didn't actually help take down AK...in fact, he called AK to warn her about it and to tell her, basically what amounted to change of heart. And Laurel is just telling them they'd have been implicated. Wes wasn't even remotely doing that and that was never his intention to implicate them all. Laurel is flat out lying to them - we watched the whole play of events and Wes wasn't putting the others at risk, never was. 

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel's just such a pro at lying and manipulating that she's convinced them based 100% on her word alone...and none of them have actually tried to corroborate anything. Now Michaela and Oliver feel like they're honoring Wes so they are all in. Laurel wants to destroy Jorge...and it's not about Wes...she said so herself...it's about HER life...and not everything is about this stupid baby.

&amp;nbsp;

She tells them they have to get the Antares files - STILL ON A FISHING EXPEDITION to find something illegal she can use to leak out and wreck Anatares before it goes public - which will also wreck Michaela's dream job and wreck her tie with Tegan...and Laurel doesn't give one rat's ass about any of that. When Oliver says the only way to access the files and bypass security is the badge Tegan has, Laurel expects them to steal it. Asher bugs the apartment and confronts Michaela who then tells Asher Laurel's dad killed Wes. No evidence. Ever. Not a shred of it. 

&amp;nbsp;


As each episode plays out, we're all caught up in Laurel's claims and none of them have tried to confirm it either way...and to think this is legit ask one simple question:

&amp;nbsp;

Why hasn't Laurel shared this with Annalise - with all of them outright where they could dig into it and find actual evidence? Laurel's doing this on the sly, manipulating the egos and oblivion and hearts of the group with baseless claims. 

&amp;nbsp;

**S4 - 7: Nobody Roots For Goliath**

&amp;nbsp;

Asher puts her in a corner so they tell Frank...and rightfully, he says - just tell the cops and he can go to jail...Laurel insists some accountant was murdered and her father will pay off the cops...they just need to leak the documents...

&amp;nbsp;

But again, go back...she's already acknowledged she has no fucking idea IF there even are any documents...she wants the files enough to lie, deceive, manipulate and risk their jobs and their lives (cause now she's got them spooked they could be killed too), and not one shred of evidence to support it. She started this plan on a fishing expedition and to this date in the season she still hasn't found squat. Not even on the ""accountant"" that was ""murdered""...she saw a name twice. One as a mysterious death and another as a donor...and Laurel came up with the story there was a connection.

&amp;nbsp;

Frank demands this shit comes to a halt...Laurel refuses and points out all of Frank's crimes and that she's trying to put her father in jail for the crimes he's actually committed...and yet, she's never once provided any basis of any crime at all. Her ""evidence"" wouldn't hold up to even a rookie cop, much less an FBI investigation.

&amp;nbsp;

**SIMON's RANDOM VIRUS**

&amp;nbsp;

Simon is suddenly getting Oliver to fix his infected computer and reveals his risk of deportation. If C&amp;G gives him a job he can stay...but now he's at risk of getting fired. Meanwhile Tegan enlists Michaela to plan an announcement party. Laurel plays on Frank's feelings and gets him to support the plan to steal AT files from C&amp;G - again, based only on Laurel telling them there MIGHT be something illegal in them.

&amp;nbsp;

**Paternity Test**

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel agrees to a paternity test after Frank questions her...or so she says. She takes a swab. We later find out she allegedly did this test and it shows Frank isn't baby daddy.

&amp;nbsp;

**4 - 8 Live Live Live**

&amp;nbsp;

1 and a half months before the Simon incident and Laurel giving birth she is disinterested in ""this stupid baby""...Frank gets pulled into it and Connor mouths off calling Frank Laurel's little bitch. Frank roughs him up and accidentally jabs Laurel in the stomach. 

&amp;nbsp;

During an exchange with Connor protesting this, Laurel slips up...and she asks him, *""Do you not remember what Wes' body looked like in that basement when you cracked his ribs trying to give him CPR?""
*
&amp;nbsp;

But Wes didn't look like anything - just unconscious on the floor. The fire hadn't started yet so Wes wasn't burned or injured other than being unconscious from whatever drug Dominic injected him with. What, exactly, would she be referring to then?

&amp;nbsp;

Frank plans the incriminating evidence about Denver and Jorge on Simon's computer - which he got directly from Laurel...

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel goes to C&amp;G after all and tells them it's because she had a feeling they'd try to bail.

&amp;nbsp;

Later, Connor calls AK and tells her what's going on, blurting out, ""Laurel's father killed Wes and now everyone's at Caplan &amp; Gold trying to bankrupt his company.""


&amp;nbsp;

In the server room with Laurel, Oliver discovers the files are distributed across different servers and it'd take awhile to get them all, and points out yet again there's no way to know where the illegal files even are, and I quote: ""If there are any...""

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel gets exasperated and pushes him to keep looking, saying ""there are!"" and Oliver replies, ""So you keep saying...""

&amp;nbsp;

Later, AK tells the 911 operator that the baby wasn't supposed to be here yet, it's only been 7 months.

&amp;nbsp;

**Dominic At Laurel's**

&amp;nbsp;

Why he'd be there is a question requiring an answer - but given Connor's actual statements, Dominic appears confused and flashes back to Wes, presumably thinking that conversation is about Wes...which makes him concerned. He appears to know nothing about any Antares files being transferred to any hard drive or whatever that's even about. So later when Laurel tells her story, keep that in mind.

&amp;nbsp;

**4- 11 He's A Bad Father**

&amp;nbsp;

After all that risk and drama, there never was anything on the hard drive. It goes MIA and Laurel is focused on the custody story, apparently having forgotten all about looking for any illegal files. 

&amp;nbsp;

None of them have the presence of mind to ever ask WHY Jorge finds this kid at all relevant enough to do all this shit...

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel loses and Jorge keeps custody of the child. He calls later looking for Sandrine and Laurel plays off having no idea...but the others still question it until she convinces them he's trying to make her look bad. 

&amp;nbsp;

FINALLY Frank asks AK if she's ever wondered if they got this wrong about Jorge - all they know about him is just what Laurel told them. AK waves it off and that's the end of that. He later confides in Bonnie - what if Jorge didn't actually kill Wes. He later baits Jorge and nothing comes of it...

&amp;nbsp;

When she's questioned, Laurel later backsteps and questions it out loud in front of them, and then wonders if it was her mother instead...

&amp;nbsp;

Frank is less convinced of Laurel's story - when he finds out Sandrine's been calling Jorge every day for a week he jumps the gun and concludes Sandrine and Laurel are in on it together...and then has to step back when Sandrine tells Laurel she's been calling Jorge every day all week to convince him to let Laurel see the baby without him, and he agrees.

&amp;nbsp;

All the way through Nate delivering the hard drive to them, and Laurel saying she's looking for shit that incriminates her, we are baited and dragged along Laurel's plot to take down her father but there is nothing in the Antares files either way. 

&amp;nbsp;

It comes clear on closer observation that Laurel did all of this on an idea there might be something illegal and never provides a shred of proof. We see her looking for something, fishing, but never actually finding anything. Instead, she offers flaky shit and relies on her ability to manipulate and play on emotions to get them all to implicate themselves in a master plan to commit multiple felonies - while she sits home, of course.

&amp;nbsp;

Whatever Dominic and she were actually discussing it motivated her to go to C&amp;G and get the hard drive and take possession of it. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Drug Induced Labor**

&amp;nbsp;

According to the nurses and DHS officer or whoever, Laurel's tox reports showed evidence of cocaine and a drug induced labor and her medical history showed the mental illness and whatnot. Laurel swears all of this is her father paying people off and fabricating it to hold her in the psych ward while he jumped in to get custody.

&amp;nbsp;

There is a lot of blood when a woman gives birth but not that much. She appeared to be miscarrying, giving birth to a stillborn kid. She was fine when she left, though shaken...she was not traumatized. She was calm, cool and collected when she got in the cab to home (presumably home) and then got AK's message about helping. Laurel mulls it over and then has the cab change course.

&amp;nbsp;

We know nothing about what happened between then and Laurel walking into the elevator but we do see her bleeding profusely and freaking out about it. Since it's just her, we presume she didn't see that coming...but it does not mean she didn't do something to try and induce labor...and it was way worse than she anticipated. 

&amp;nbsp;

It is also possible that now that she had the drive, she intended to ingest something that would terminate the pregnancy, and give birth to a stillborn, and be free of it across the board but it didn't go according to plan - or freaked her out in spite of it...but AK revived the baby and it got the care it needed...and it's entirely possible that the conversation between Laurel and Dominic was about that.


&amp;nbsp;

Dominic was on his way to see her because she was going to end the pregnancy. He doesn't know it was his all along, perhaps. Dominic is telling her not to go through with it, don't do it - end the pregnancy - and that her father knows she's pregnant and if he knows that, he knows other things...but she waves him off and does it anyway. 

&amp;nbsp;

Dominic goes to her apartment to talk sense into her...but overhears Connor talking about Laurel probably driving off a bridge and cops and drive...and he's not sure what's going on...and wonders if it's about Wes. He leaves, taking his phone out...

&amp;nbsp;

And Dominic calls Jorge himself to tell him about Laurel's intentions to terminate the pregnancy and that is why Jorge sweeps in when he learns the baby is alive and moves to get it away from her. 

&amp;nbsp;

Dominic may have known after all that it was his kid...which would make his taunts to Frank make sense. He says nothing about any hard drive because he never knew anything about a hard drive or that plot one way or another...Laurel's plot was something else entirely...her mess...and he taunts Frank saying he's still trying to make Laurel love him even though the kid's not his...and no one really knows her - not him, not Jorge, not Frank, definitely not Wes. 

&amp;nbsp;

How the fuck would Dominic know as of the night of the party that the kid wasn't Frank's? How would Dominic know it was or wasn't Wes'? Dominic admits to Frank he fell for her too...and Frank kills him before he can get any real information about Jorge.

&amp;nbsp;

Dominic wouldn't go to Laurel's to kill her. He was talking to her on the phone and then he goes to the apartment...then he gets side tracked and then Frank abducts him and kills him.

&amp;nbsp;

Laurel sought info on abortions...which came up during the custody hearing. It's always possible she got or tried to obtain the drug to terminate the pregnancy and when it failed, she sought other means - cocaine...intending to induce labor at AK's which would be terminating the pregnancy right along with it. 

&amp;nbsp;

When her plan backfired and the baby didn't die and Jorge intervened, she was kind of fucked into dealing with that situation, lost her leverage, and had to deal with it. In the end, Jorge never mentions the hard drive even once...not even remotely. What he wanted back was his daughter. He resented AK for poisoning Laurel against him even though Laurel was the one with the poison all along convincing them all he's a monster...believing her - 

&amp;nbsp;

Stop accusing Laurel of something you and I both know she's not capable of

&amp;nbsp;

Then you don't know my daughter.

&amp;nbsp;

If you rewatch you will see that, like AK, Frank, even Bonnie, and the rest, we all get swept up in just what Laurel says...but the show itself never ever once corroborates it with Jorge even mentioning a hard drive or knowing about the plan, or anything else. He focuses on family and being wealthy and why Frank isn't worthy of her, and that she has mental issues...while Sandrine tries to warn Wes off of Laurel before she hurts him, and then Dominic taunting Frank about the pregnancy.

&amp;nbsp;

The evidence was always there but it gets sailed over in favor of the dramatics...but it's very likely Laurel did take some sort of drug to terminate the pregnancy and deliver it...and that is what Dominic was trying to warn her not to go through with, and then decided to go to her apartment to persuade her but she wasn't there.

Grumpy older lady comes in to pick up medications, and tells me that she thinks there's two more refills scheduled for the 23rd. She asks if we can get them ready for her today. I pull up her profile, and there's nothing ready for the 23rd; the only refill scheduled is one medication, for the 28th.

&amp;#x200B;

She tells me that she's ""going to slap me"" if she comes in on Tuesday and there's any prescriptions ready for her. Now, I'm not really going to be spending much time looking over my shoulder because of this. At the same time, though, I feel like it pretty clearly crosses the line of what's acceptable.

&amp;#x200B;

My pharmacy manager, who overheard the situation, told the woman that she didn't appreciate anyone threatening her techs, put a note on her profile describing what happened, and that was pretty much the end of the situation. She said that if this patient steps out of line again, she's gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just curious what, if any, recourse I have, or how to document this. The woman has been pretty unpleasant in all of the interactions I've had with her, and I'd like to have something to point to in case something else would happen in the future (whether with myself or another tech/pharmacist.)

Just wondering if you fine folks might have any thoughts. Thanks!"

Lisa, the intern from W.H.O.R.E.S.,  could see most of her colleagues nod their heads in appreciation as every one stripped her naked with the eyes.  Her boss unzipped her skirt for the second time that day, letting it fall at her feet. He then simply ripped her this blouse apart. Lisa was now standing in her underwear in front of 15 men who all sported huge bulges in their pants.

""Alright boys, here’s your reward for meeting our sales target this quarter!” said her boss as he picked up Lisa in his arms and put her down on the conference table. 

By now all the men had stepped out of their pants and their hands soon began feeling her, pinching her mauling her. Her bra and panties were ripped from her body and Lisa lay lewdly displayed on the table. She was spread eagled as strong hands held her hands and legs pinning her down.

As the CEO climbed out of the limo and up the stairs of his private jet to take his business flight, Jenny, his lovely hostess from W.H.O.R.E.S., greeted him with chilled champagne and a dazzling smile. She looked delicious in their air hostess outfits, down over the slightly-too-tight blouses with two more buttons undone to show her pert breasts. Her short skirts and dark stockings showed off her long, slender legs to perfection, as did the shiny, black pumps with six-inch heels.

“Our flight from London to Hong Kong would take about 10 hours, so please don’t hesitate to let me know if there’s anything I can do to make it an enjoyable and memorable flight for all of us ... anything at all. “ said Jenny, as she bent down in front him, giving him a glimpse of black lace between the soft, pale mounds of her breasts as she reached down to fasten his seatbelt.

Sarah, the secretary from W.H.O.R.E.S., remained completely hidden under her boss’s large thick mahogany wood desk while he was having a video conference. He was still fully dressed in his charcoal suit, except that his  zipper was fully unzipped, and his cock completely exposed while her secretary sucking on the head of his cock. 

He couldn’t focus as he one of his fellow managers kept talking on the screen in front of him, as everything was drowned out by the sensation of Sarah's hot, wet mouth, closed around the tip of his engorged cock. Her tongue was sliding around in circles, causing his dick to jerk within her grasp.

9q9o4s,1,2018-10-21,Not sure if they're just really overprotective or something else....,winkingelephant,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9q9o4s/not_sure_if_theyre_just_really_overprotective_or/,"They've always been the typical overprotective helicopter parents. Always around and watching, making it difficult for me to grow. I always felt watched, because well, I was. I couldn't do much outside of school. Just go to school and band practice, to church, and to family things. In high school I applied to a dream college and was guilt tripped into turning it down because they weren't ready for me to leave. I went to community college then and felt like my life was on hold for those 2 years. I tried to change my major after a year, but was told that I'd never find a job in psych, and that I as a young woman wouldn't want to have to get a master's or phd. So I was told to go into teaching. So um, needless to say, I was ready to get out and transfer, and I changed my major to psych since they can't really stop me from 2 hours away. 

I just feel really bitter about how I was raised I guess. Growing up in a place with very antiquated gender norms and growing up a southern baptist. All that's expected of me is to move back in with my parents, marry a man, and make babies. And my father has anger problems. I've seen him kick and beat our dog and tear apart a leather wallet. He sometimes gives me this look when he's angry that makes me think he'll actually hit me for once. 

I'm bitter that they are never really proud of my real accomplishments. They don't seem to care about the right things, just whatever things make them look like good parents.  I can never share things with them because I'll get lectured for it. 

I'm just kinda confused. They want to know things, but they're always things that end up being used against me. I'm not sure they even know my favorite animal or color. I'm a completely different person around them. I'm afraid to be me around them. It's scary to know just how homophobic and transphobic they are, especially when I'm bi/ace and have been questioning my gender lately.

I'm looking into post-grad options and moving further away, but I'm still financially dependent. I think my best option is a master's program that requires an internship, since they have a high rate of graduates get a job with their internship employer after graduating. I can worry about the phd later. 

I just want to get out. But I don't really know if my reasons are valid."
9q9r98,4,2018-10-21,I might run away. I might not,Vicstor27,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9q9r98/i_might_run_away_i_might_not/,"[M24] I'm trying to help out my family but it doesn't seem they want it. Whenever I question or try constructive criticism, I'm threatened of being kicked out. Ever since I graduated with a Bachelor's in International Business in January, I told my father I wanted to do an internship for Logistics. His response was, ""if you're not with me (at the company), then don't expect to ever live here."" At the time, I felt betrayed. I felt like I owed him something too because he payed for my school and I had no money, so I gave in. Later, he stopped paying me since June and even asked me to pay for some of his bills because business is not doing so well. I saw a lot of bills that weren't being payed and overspending on a lot of dumb things like a new car that he doesn't even drive. I don't know what to do. I'm thinking of leaving. I have 2500 in my bank and 1000 in credit card debt. If I do leave, I'll stay at a friend's place for a little bit. The thing is, I'm not confident of getting a job. I've applied to many jobs since December but no luck. I don't want to be homeless but I also don't want to be dragged down by him. I've saved him money and kept many people from leaving but he keeps being the asshole boss thinking everything he thinks is right and spends his money on dumb shit. If I stay it's to help, if I leave it's to leave a toxic place. I don't know. What do you think?"
9q9tg8,1,2018-10-21,Money Matters,Wilder84,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9q9tg8/money_matters/,"My partner(m39) and I(f34) have been together for 5.5 years. After being long distance for 6 months (we met when I was living in Korea and he in Japan), we  moved in together in the Netherlands as he got a PhD position there. I then moved back to the UK to do my masters and save some money as it was very difficult to find a job in the Netherlands. So we were long distance for several years (meeting very regularly thanks to budget airlines!) and then at the start of this year we moved back to Korea and in with his parents (his decision as he wanted to focus on writing up his thesis and spend some time with them). 


We have had several problems but right now, I am looking for advice regarding money.


So over the first 4.5 years, he was earning more than me and he paid for more things. I paid for what I could, and even for some things I couldn't (he is big into running and always wants me to come to his races, so I paid several times for airbnbs, flights etc, even when it really wasn't in my budget). I bought him nice presents (he has expensive taste). My point I guess is that although he paid for more, I wasn't freeloading - and I was always active, with full time studies, jobs, internships etc. 


Since we moved to Korea (Jan), he hasn't worked and barely works on his thesis. To stay legally in the country, I've had to get a teaching job (which I really don't enjoy) and a bunch of side hustles. I worked hard so we could move out of his parents (as I was commuting 2 hours each way daily, plus his parents wanted us out as they were fed up with him not getting any work and just sleeping, running, going sauna and getting massages - his Mum has financed him a lot over the years) so in July we got our own place. However, I pay everything - all rent, utilities, food, etc etc. I have asked him repeatedly to get a part time job (which is really easy to get and pays well) - he always tells me to find him the jobs, and he will apply. I have spent hours on several occasions sourcing the jobs and putting them on Evernote and he always promises to apply but never does. I am only asking him to work 4-5 hours a week and give me a little of that money towards living costs, but if I push the issue, he blows up and says that even if I fully financially supported him for a year, it wouldn't even come close to the money he has spent on me over the years. 


I wouldn't mind him not earning if I could see he was genuinely making an effort to find work, or even if he wasn't looking for work but was making an earnest effort to work on his thesis - but I rarely see him doing anything PhD related, maybe 2-3 hours a week max, and I am pretty sure he hasn't even started writing the actual thesis. He mostly watches YouTube, goes running, relaxes. Sometimes he vacuums and he does often cook dinner as I get home quite late (although I think he could do more housework but I haven't said so as he will get angry).


Additionally, next month he is going to Shanghai to run a marathon. He has bought his ticket, booked accommodation etc, I think from savings he has in Australia (but he often uses his Mum's card to pay for extra expenses). The trip will cost at least $500-600, and I am buying him a new pair of (expensive) running shoes as that was his birthday request (for my birthday, I got a card and a promise of a massage from him, which is forever delayed whenever I bring it up). 


I have tried asking nicely for him to work part time, helping him find work, etc. I have tried a harder tack (""from next month, I'm only going to be paying half the rent""). Nothing works. 


The last straw is that he supervises my own spending - for example, I recently bought myself a book as I miss reading. I wanted to tell him about it, but as soon as I took the book out of my bag, he snatched it to check the price and then had a go at me for spending that money. My earphones broke recently and I picked out a new pair I wanted, but he insisted I buy a different pair (to the point where he gets in a bad mood if I buy the pair I had chosen and goes on and on about it - not just from a money perspective, but because he did some research and insists he is right about what is good and what's not). 


Am I being unfair in my requests that he get work? Is my building resentment misguided? I have seriously thought about breaking up but he has good qualities: if I have a problem, he tries to help me figure it out. He is usually gentle and funny when he is in a good mood. He is very smart and takes good care of our dog. 


TL;DR - my partner is not contributing financially and is not making an effort to rectify the situation. If I bring it up, he tells me I'm being selfish.

At least here in the Netherlands this is a very unpopular opinion. I am not against death sentences. 

I'm a 3th year bachelor student studying information security, doing an internship at the second biggest health care provider in the Netherlands at the moment, and I'm also a Certified Protection Officer, a title granted to me after following and completing an American 1 year course about terrorism, physical security, labor laws, security best practices, human psychology in relation to theft and overall illegal actions, drug usage and it's effects etc. This is not to flaunt myself, but more so you can see where I'm coming fron with this. 

Because of working/living in the security world, I tend to see things in a different way, and I also see some more offensive, gruesome or downright horrible things. That also means I can really let those things get to me sometimes and they really bother me. 

Two guys stealing a puppy, someone getting mugged/raped, people who makes other's lives miserable, pedophilia, murder, people who dump toxic waste, Weed distributors who scam people out of their minds (this in particular happens a lot in the Netherlands), Animal Abuse, the list is endless.

What I want to say is, I've never felt like giving those kinds of people a death sentence is wrong. I don't think sending them to prison is wrong either, but with prisons getting fuller and fuller and increasing expenditures the government has to make to keep these people living under ""humane"" circumstances, I could say thinking a death sentence is in order isn't wrong.

I get that generally speaking, death sentences are a big no no in this day and age, but considering the damage that some evildoers cause to either nature or emotional damage to the victim's relatives or loved ones, who often never fully recover or find the means to settle with what happened, I'm going to be brutally honest and say that those kinds of people deserve a death sentence.

Now you could come up to me and say; but wouldn't executing the accused cause emotional damage to the relatives and loved ones of the accused as well, and I would say, yeah it probably will. I can't speak for others in this regard, as a mom who's son has committed horrible crimes might be happy her son is at least alive and well in prison instead of dead. 

It's a bit of a moral dilemma. What does reddit think about the death sentence? Is it really inhumane? "
9qbcor,2,2018-10-22,I (21M) told my friend (21F) I did not reciprocate her feelings... except now I do.,PsychologicalWash2,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9qbcor/i_21m_told_my_friend_21f_i_did_not_reciprocate/,"Title kinda says it all. We didn't know each other that well before January when a friend introduced me to her and then we were only acquaintances until this summer when we ended up getting different internships in the same city so we hung out a lot in our free time because we were the only people we knew. Oh, and I was completely oblivious to her interest in me.

&amp;#x200B;

By August she had become pretty obvious about her feelings,, the females of our mutual friend group (who also pushed me to ask out my last girlfriend at my exes prompting) started telling me how good we would be together and how similar we were, etc... This culminated in her very nervously asking me out to dinner to repay me for an extraordinarily small favor (Not even kidding, I helped her move two boxes). I was extremely impressed, I have never had a girl be direct with me before. I downgraded our meeting to a lunch at a private place (I paid for myself despite her protestations) and was straight with her. I asked if she had feelings for me because I thought she did. She said, ""yes"".

&amp;#x200B;

I told her these exact words ""I don't like getting led on so I want to make sure I don't do that to you so I need to be straight with you. I do not reciprocate your feelings, and I do not see any possible situation where anything romantic will ever happen between us."" Then I told her that I appreciate her friendship and would like to continue that, but I understand if she needed some time. She seemed to take it in stride. She didn't say she was taking some time, but I figure she did because she stopped coming to activities I was a part of for about three weeks. I still saw my other friends spending time with her though.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I told her that is because I had asked another very close friend out last year and was rejected, but she added a ""not right now"" qualifier. I took that as I just need to wait and did my best to be there for her until thankfully, one of her friends (of the girl I recently asked, not the one who asked me)  told me she meant to reject me but didn't want to hurt my feelings and now felt guilty because I seemed to be waiting. This was a month before I was asked by this other girl and I was still in the whole ""woe is me"" mode over this girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Well... maybe I should've added a ""not right now"" qualifier because now that I've come out of that mode I see a lot of potential for a meaningful relationship with this other girl. Except, I've already told her there is no way I would ever develop romantic feelings for her... Mostly I'm wondering would I be a jerk to ask her after I was so direct with her in the opposite direction? Because when I told her there was no way, I really meant it, I had no feelings for her at all and did not see the potential for any feelings with her. I don't believe a lot of love stories begin with ""When I met her, I had no feelings whatsoever for her and I told her that to her face the precise moment she showed any interest in me.""

&amp;#x200B;

A noteworthy factor in my change of heart: my mom and dad happened to meet her a few weeks ago and LOVED her. Bear in mind, they knew nothing about any of this, we were in a group with about 10 other people and for some reason she stood out to them over all my other friends and they still ask about (tell me I should pursue) her. My parents have always approved of my past girlfriends, but never to this extreme and they are not typically in the business of meddling in their children's romantic lives.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; Could I get any more concise than the title? My question is below.

I see a lot of potential for a meaningful relationship with this other girl. Except, I've already told her there is no way I would ever develop romantic feelings for her... Mostly I'm wondering would I be a jerk to ask her after I was so direct with her in the opposite direction?"

But I have a slight weakness; I hope I'm never discovered. Those young interns - cute little asses, wearing sandals showing off their sexy toes. I don't want to risk my career, but damn!

so I am a bit troubled at the moment, I am almost done with my econ bachelors degree in Germany and the lectures I like the most are by far the logistics lectures. So now I am thinking about a masters degree in supply chain management so that I can work as a buyer in supply chain, to be honest though, I dont know a lot about the job.

This is my perception of the job:

You are trying to save your company money by buying goods in a good quality that also guarantees a good ROI. Then you make sure that the bought goods are at the right place at the right time. 

Is this correct?

I am looking for an internship at the moment but where I live those kind of internships are hard to come by.

What does a typical day as a buyer look like?

How does it pay?

And are you guys happy with your job, how is the workload?

Thanks for any answers!"

Don't take this seriously! It's like the 'What if' comics from marvel. Without further ado, lets start! 

""Enough Kacchan!"" Cried a small green haired boy ""Y'already made him cry. Stop it!'' He spluttered ""I'll... I'll"" ""You'll what?"" sneered the boy named Kacchan. ""So Deku, the quirkless wonder, thinks he can fight me? What do you guys think?"" He gestured towards two boys behind him. One making his fingers longer, the other flapping demon-like wings. ""D'you think he'll stand a chance?"" Raucous waves of laughter came from the boys behind Kacchan. ""Let's see"" he growled as he slammed his fist into his palm. A small explosion erupted from where the palm met his fist. ""O-oh y-yeah?"" Deku retorted ""You th-think you're s-strong with your flashy quirk?"" Deku bellowed, his voice trembling, he was on the brink of tears. ""W-w-watch this!"" Deku knew he had a quirk. He was told 1 month before this encounter by a doctor, he just never told Kacchan. All the doctor had to do was check his foot. You see, 80% of the Earth's population has a quirk. A superpower ranging from starfish ears to complete control of fibre to being so strong you can create a hurricane with one punch. The way to find out if you have a quirk is to get an X-ray of your foot. If you have 1 joint in your pinky toe, you have a quirk. When Deku found out he had 1 joint, he passed out. Anyway on with the story. 
Deku inhaled as much air as he could gather and willed his quirk to activate. Deku exhaled and instead of carbon dioxide, Deku exhaled fire! He mostly took after his father in this regard. Deku's father could breathe fire and his mother had basic telekinesis. The torrent of fire was enough to send the boys running at full speed. Deku even saw Kacchan climb onto the back of the boy with the wings. Kacchan began screaming 'Faster faster!' Deku turned around and helped the crying boy up. They shook hands and walked away. 

       **13 YEARS LATER** 

'A giant villain!!' Smiled a 14 year-old Deku. Deku's real name is 'Izuku Midoriya', and Deku was a nickname given to him by Kacchan, real name Katsuki Bakugo. 'GET AWAYYYYYYY!' Screamed the villain. Murmurs of 'Wow, what an idiot' and 'I could never beat him' flowed out of the crowd watching the fight. The villain was not alone, a pro hero Kamui woods was fighting him. Kamui's quirk is 'wood', his body is made of hardened wood and he can manipulate it at will. ""It's Kamui woods!"" exclaimed Deku ""The popular young superstar!"" A middle aged man with starfish ears asked ""A running commentary huh, Kid are you a fanboy?"" ""Uh, no. Heh heh"" came Deku's embarrassed reply. ""Illegal use of abilities during rush hour, as well as robbery and assault? You're pure evil."" ""Take him down, tree-man!"" Bellowed the starfish-eared man. ""Here it comes, it's his 'preemptive binding'"" Kamui woods' arms split into roots ""Your punishment"" uttered Kamui ""Lacquered Chain  Prison!"" Cried Kamui as his arms tightened around the villain. ""Canyon Cannon!"" Yelled a woman no shorter than 20ft. Both Deku and the man with the starfish ears froze with confusion. ""Today's my debut!"" Explained the large woman ""Pleased to meet you all! You can call me Mt. Lady!"" 

          **THE NEXT DAY** 

""You guys are all 3rd years now,"" called Deku's teacher ""It's time for you to think about your careers."" ""But who am I kidding,"" asked the teacher rhetorically ""You all want to be heroes!"" A cheer came from most of the class. The only one who didn't join in was Deku. The rest of the class activated their quirks. ""C'mon teacher!"" Yelled Kacchan obnoxiously, ""Don't lump me in with these losers! They're quirks are NOTHING compared to MINE!"" Kacchan leapt onto his desk and made explosions erupt from his hands. ""I'M GONNA BE BETTER THAN ALL MIGHT!"" Cried Kacchan maniacally ""SIT DOWN BAKUGO"" yelled the teacher, his hand extending from his wrist and hitting Kacchan on the head. ""Detention!"" He cried. ""I DON'T CARE"" screamed Kacchan, and as he laughed like a madman, the bell rang ""SEE YOU EXTRAS LATER!"" Kacchan shouted as he approached Deku ""DON'T DARE TRY AND APPLY FOR U.A OR I'L-"" Kacchan seemed to calm down ""What's this"" he sneered, picking up a book on Deku's desk "" 'Hero analysis for my future'? What, you tryna become a hero, what can you do again? Breathe fire? Pshh, you'll never do much. You can be my cook for my mansion when I become the #1 hero.""  An explosion erupted from Kacchan's palm, burning the journal. ""Nooo!"" Deku cried. Kacchan threw the journal out of the window. ""Do me a favour and follow the journal."" Kacchan  growled as he left the room. 

              **1 HOUR LATER** 

Midoriya was walking down the street after picking up the journal. Luckily, nothing was damaged. Midoriya stopped at an underpass near a drain to call his mum. *beep beep, beep beep* ""Hi mum,"" Deku said into the phone ""School's just finished, I'm just at the underpass you want to pick me up"" ""Hey honey"" replied Inko Midoriya, Deku's mum, ""I can't pick you up because I'm out shopping, there's udon in the fridge if you get hungry before I come home, see you around 2, bye!'' ""Ok"" Deku thought to himself ""I can walk home today."" As Deku turned around to start walking home, a large man made of what looks like sludge slid out of the drain ""You'll do nicely"" came the sludge-man's rasping voice. ""AAAAAAAAH HEELLLP PLEEEAASE ANYBODY"" ""Shut UP!"" whisper-shouted the sludge-man. ""I'm gonna kill you and use your body as a vessel to get myself outta town, you got m- AAAAARGH STOOPP! IT BURNS""  After coming to his senses, Deku had let out a gale of fire from his mouth and willed it to turn into the only shape he could, a dragon. You see, Deku had been training in secret, not even his mum knew. He had been letting out a little bit of fire and turning it into a dragon, then making that dragon attack a punching-bag in his room. He had been able to control it for longer and longer before his sore throat kicked in, the drawback of his quirk. ""CHAAARGE"" Deku commanded the dragon, but before the dragon could land another hit, ""DETROIT SMASH!"" The sludge-man fell apart as a muscular man scooped him up into empty 2 litre cola bottles. ""Thank you, young boy!"" Came the man's booming voice. ""A-All might?!"" Stuttered Deku. ""Yes it is me, All might, the number 1 superhero! Thank you young boy, for helping me vanqu- Young boy? Young boy!"" Deku had passed out from meeting All might. ""What's this"" All might muttered, as he picjed up Deku's journal. ""A notebook about heroes? This kid's obsessed, but not in a bad way."" After signing Deku's journal, All might tapped Deku on the shoulder and he sprung to life. ""I'm so grateful that I could help, All might"" Deku cried, through a series of bows ""Thank you again"" boomed All might ""but I must go, All might AWAY!"" All might leapt into the sky. Deku continued his walk home and in a dark alleyway, a fight was breaking out ""GET OFF OF MEEEEE!"" Screamed Kacchan ""Someone's gotta do something!"" People were crying. Deku saw the crowd and approached ""KACCHAN!"" Deku cried. ""Oh god oh God, WHERE'S ALL MIGHT?"" Deku thought to himself, but before he could think any longer, his legs started running. ""AAAARGH"" he cried, ""KACCHAN I'M COMING TO SAVE YOU"" ""LEAVE ME ALONE YOU USELESS DEKU!"" Came Kacchan's roaring reply. Deku inhaled as much air as he could, Kacchan's explosions had set a lot of things on fire, helping Deku. Deku exhaled with a cry of ''CHARGE!"" The dragon slammed into the sludge monster, making him retract from Kacchan momentarily ""Why're you here Deku!?"" Sneered Kacchan ""Y-you looked like you needed saving."" came Deku's snivelling reply. Salty tears fell into Deku's open mouth. ""DETROIT SMAASH!"" The sludge monster flew away from Kacchan. ""All might I-"" spluttered Deku ""It's okay, I understand."" Replied All might. ""Take care of these two boys, I have to go"" All might said as he once more leapt into the sky. The pro heroes on the scene scalded Deku a little but told him that he ""Acted like a hero"" when no-one else could. Kacchan was told that he would make a great hero and that he could intern with most of the heroes when he attended U.A. 
Deku was just outside of his house when ""Young boy! Young boy wait!"" It was All might. ""All might I-"" ""Doesn't matter,"" boomed All might ""I want to thank you. Back there I was a coward, you see-"" but before All might was finished, a cloud of smoke surrounded him. When it cleared, a small dishevelled man stood in front of Deku. ""AAAAARGH"" screamed Deku ""IMPOST-"" ""It's still me"" interrupted the small man. ""I'm still All might"" Deku calmed down ""Let's cut to the chase, do you want to be a hero?"" ""Y-yeah!"" Replied Deku ""Well I'm gonna train you."" Uttered All might ""Uuurgh?"" Spluttered Deku.
""I'm gonna make your quirk as strong as mine"" Explained All might ""I'll do it!"" Came Deku's overwhelmed reply. ""Meet me at Degobah municipal beach, tomorrow at 9:15."" Said All might. ""I'll get there as soon as I can!"""

I am currently in a Canadian University and am needing to buy a new laptop this reading week. I have been attempting to do as much unbiased research as I can (hence reddit - hopefully). 

I am in Software Engineering, and require a laptop with good performance and reliability. I am currently running intel pentium on Windows 7. I am upgrading because my computer does not support virtualization. This means I cannot run Linux on a VM. I also cannot test my Android Studio applications unless I have a physical android device to build the APK on.   
I will be travelling to Germany for 4 months (soon) for a AI / machine learning robotics internship. So I need to get this laptop very soon so I can finish off this semester strong and then bring the reliable machine overseas.   


What I have concluded in my research:

The Dell XPS 13 and XPS 13 Developer edition are great computers, but are known for having issues. I then was suggested looking into the ThinkPad lineup which brought me to the forums of X1C6 vs t480s. From my gathering, the X1C6 has a better display, but the t480s has a better performance option with the available 24 RAM. 

Although I am pretty familiar with computers, I mostly stick with software so I do not know specs super well. 

After sifting through some other articles, I believe I am more convinced to go the thinkpad route, but now need to decide which one to get.

I was reading some users say that the t480s is a better choice long term since 16 gb RAM may not be optimal in a few years? The downfall to this is the display quality though.  


Bottom line question: For my purposes (coding, dual booting with Linux, virtualization, running heavy programs such as Quartus Prime or Android Studios (etc) ), what would be the better choice? Obviously having a quality display is nice, but if the t480s beats the X1C6 in every other way I may lean towards that. However, not knowing exactly how much RAM and performance I require for the tasks I will be doing, I may be fine with the 16gb RAM on the X1C6 and get that better quality display. Also the XPS 13 isn't quite out of the picture, but I assume after posting in the thinkad thread it will be haha.  


Thanks for the support! I really appreciate any feedback. I am looking to purchase this week."

TL;DR - An interesting story about Paul Jesperson from his autobiography. He had an experience that changed his life involving the furnace that powered the ""LDS Hospital"" in SLC, UT. The story sheds some modern day light on the experiences of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego - but moreover is a wonderful story of repentance and salvation.

&amp;#x200B;

I came across this article today, and just had to share. It's a wonderful story and I hope you enjoy it. I'm copying it below for ""posterity"". Although, I doubt the LDSBC website is going away anytime soon.

=============================================================================================

## The Fiery Furnace

About 600 years before Christ—at about the same time that Lehi and his family were leaving for the new world, Jerusalem was conquered by the Babylonians. Israelite slaves were taken to serve their masters in Babylon . Four of the most famous were Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. They are known for refusing to eat of the king’s rich diet and drinking his wine. Daniel became known for interpreting King Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams—similar to Joseph and the Egyptian Pharaoh. Daniel subsequently served as the confidante and counselor of the King. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were placed over the affairs of the province of Babylon.

Some time after the ascent to leadership in the Babylonian kingdoms, jealous dignitaries close to the King sought to destroy the Israelites. A great golden image—90 feet high—was built and placed in the kingdom where all could come and worship it. The dedication of the image was a major affair of state. All the dignitaries of the kingdom were called in, which included Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Music would be played at a certain time of the day and then all would worship. And it was said that, “Whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace” (Daniel 3:4-6).

Because it was against their religion to worship idols, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego refused to bow down to the huge golden image. Subsequently they were taken to the fiery furnace to be consumed. Where Daniel was at this time we are not told. He was probably close at hand and either lacked the authority to stop the tragic proceedings or was told by the Lord not to interfere. So the decree was carried out. The three Jews were bound tightly in their robes and thrown into the furnace.

The heat of the fire was so hot that the soldiers who threw the young men into the furnace were burned to death themselves (Daniel 3:17 -22). The Bible then tells us that King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste, and spoke, “Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?” He then said, “I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have not hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God” (Daniel 3:24-30). The king then commanded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to come forth out of the furnace and subsequently restored them to their administration posts. This story has a happy ending—at least for the three faithful Israelites.

I would like to tell you of a true modern day story that has similar overtimes. This story comes from chapter 12 of the autobiography of Paul Jesperson, entitled, “My Internship on Earth.” (Sixth printing 1986). Brother Jesperson was born in 1910 and died about two years ago in April of 2002. His wife, Lilly, is still alive, as are his five children. Brother Jesperson was the stake president of the Chicago Illinois Stake in 1960. He served two missions to Denmark —the country from which his parents immigrated in 1906. The following is his story:

“In my late teens while studying engineering at the University of Utah , I worked nights, seven days a week, as night engineer and fireman at the steam and electric power plant of the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City . My father was then the chief engineer at the hospital, and to help me earn my way through college, had entrusted me with this responsible job.“The plant consisted basically of four coal-fired steam boilers and two steam-driven electric generators. As the hospital was not connected to the city’s utility, it was entirely dependent on its own power plant for heat, light, and power—all vital in keeping its 300 patients alive. During my shift at the plant (from midnight until 8 a.m. ), I was entirely alone with two buildings full of large and complicated machinery and equipment. Even today I find it difficult to comprehend how such a responsibility could have been entrusted to an immature young man still in school.

“In those days, power plants were not automatic as they are now. Every pound of coal had to be shoveled into the furnace hoppers by hand; proper flow of water to the boilers, and air to the furnaces had to be manually regulated. To generate the high-pressure steam, terrific temperatures were required in the furnaces. The white-hot fire would, at times, get so intense the brick lining of the furnace would melt and run like molasses—this takes a temperature of about 3000 degrees, or ten times as hot as a baking oven. This high temperature was developed by directing a blast of air into the fire, the air being led from large fans through air tunnels under the boiler-room floor.

“As part of my job, I was required once a month to inspect these air tunnels, and clean out any ashes that might accumulate in them. I should explain that these tunnels were about thirty inches square. The main tunnel ran the length of the boiler room, in front of the boilers. From the main tunnel ran branches at right angles leading into each furnace. Immediately before the branch tunnel went under the furnace there was a large butterfly damper of one-quarter-inch-thick steel plate, roughly thirty inches square, so pivoted that it could be shut to completely close off the air to the furnace.

“To regulate the amount of air flowing, a steel bar handle was fastened to the damper and went up through the floor. There were notches along the lower edge of this handle so the fireman, standing on the boiler room floor, could lift the damper to any desired opening, and then secure it in that position by means of the proper notch. The damper was so balanced that by releasing the handle at the notch, the damper would fall shut by gravity, and the handle would automatically drop into a notch to put the damper into a locked-closed position. From the damper, the air tunnel continued another eight feet or so under the firebox of the furnace.

“One night, about three in the morning, after checking to make sure that everything in the plant would be okay during the ten minutes I expected to be down in the tunnels, I opened the manhole in the floor, let myself down into the main tunnel, and closed the manhole after me, as the air had to be kept blowing through the tunnels to keep the fires going. There was no need for a flashlight or other illumination as the white-hot fires glowed from the furnace out into the tunnel. But even though the temperatures in the fireboxes were over 2000 degrees, it was comfortably cool in the tunnel, due to the constant rush of cold air.

“Arriving in front of one of the boilers, I was now face-to-face with the steel damper. It was wide open so I could peer past it and inspect the tunnel under the firebox of the furnace, and see the cast-iron grates at the top of the air duct, and the roaring fire above. As I was so close to the fire, yet still so cool, I wondered if it was also that cool in the air duct right under the fire.

“It is said that “Young men think old men are fools—but old men know young men are fools.” Being young and foolish I decided to find out. Lying down on my back I slowly wiggled under the damper, head-first, until my head and arms were actually on the other side of the damper, and inside the furnace, with the roaring fire now just inches above my nose. The radiant heat from the glowing coals was quite intense, but amazingly enough the cold air blasting by me kept me from getting unbearably hot.

“It was at this point that I made the most stupid decision of my life. It has been said, “It ain’t what you don’t know that makes you stupid—it’s what you do know, and don’t do.” I said to myself, “I can go in all the way, then be able to brag to my friends that I have actually been inside a white-hot furnace and not consumed!” (Jacob 6:12).

“So, still on my back I continued to inch my way forward until, with a final shove, I got my feet out from under the damper and inside the furnace. In making this last move, however, a terrifying thing happened. My toe somehow caught the damper control handle, knocking it out of its supporting notch, thus causing the damper to come crashing shut. With the air flow completely cut off, I was immediately engulfed in the full heat of the furnace. Realizing that I could survive but for seconds, I knew that somehow I had to get turned around in that cramped space, and without touching the red-hot grate above me, get my hands onto the damper handle.

“To this day I don’t know how I did it, but some way or another I got myself turned around. But now the real horror of the situation struck home—the damper facing me was but a smooth piece of steel plate, completely filling the tunnel. There was no handle I could grab and release. The handle was on the opposite side! Desperately I clawed and shoved against the plate, hoping that somehow the handle had not locked shut. But it had. There was only one option left—I would have to break or bend the damper open. With the intensity that only a life-or-death struggle can command, I pressed against the damper until it felt that every blood vessel in my body would burst. But all to no avail. The damper held fast. Realizing at last that there was no way I could get out, I just quit—gave up—sank down, and prepared to die.

“What does a person think about when he faces sudden death? Some say that all the scenes of his life flash rapidly before him. Not with me. All I could think of was my parents—they would never know what happened to me, for soon I would be burned up, vaporized, and disappear without a trace. While thus in the depths of remorse for the sorrow and agony I would inflict upon my mother and father for the rest of their days, I heard a creak, then felt an inrush of cold fresh air. Opening my eyes I beheld a miracle—the damper was slowly turning open.

“With the full blast of the wind now once again around me I quickly regained my waning senses and lost no time in crawling out under the damper and into the security of the main tunnel. Only one thing was on my mind—who had unlocked the handle and opened the damper? Had someone up on the boiler room heard me rattling the damper, and then opened it? But that seemed impossible. Besides me there were only a half-dozen men in the whole world who would know where the handle was, and how to open it, and they were all miles away and sound asleep. I hurriedly crawled to the end of the tunnel, got my hands on the manhole cover, lifted it off, and boosted myself out onto the boiler-room floor. My eyes quickly scanned the area, but there was no one in sight. I walked over to the boiler I had been under. Sure enough, the damper handle was raised to full open position and locked in place. It was uncanny. I began to get the strange feeling that someone close by was watching me. With some apprehension I began a systematic search of the room, but found no one. Gathering courage I went outside, completely encircling the power plant. Not a soul was in sight—only the cold, black, silent night.

“Back inside I sat down to think. Who or what had lifted the damper against the combined pressure of the air, and the force of gravity? Then into my mind flashed the well-known Bible story of Daniel’s three friends. As you remember, King Nebuchadnezzar had them bound and thrown into the fiery furnace for not worshipping his golden image—but when he peered into the seething furnace he saw not three but four, all walking around unharmed, and one of them was a radiant being like unto the Son of God. He then called the three to come forth out of the fire. When all those assembled noticed that not a hair of the three young men was singed, nor their garments charred, and that there was no smell of fire upon them, the king said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted him.”

“I thought to myself, how long a time was I in the furnace? The maneuvering to get turned around the prolonged agony at the damper, the time in final contemplation—it had to be at least a few minutes. Yet I knew that a rag thrown into the furnace would burst into flame in a few seconds. Why hadn’t my lungs shriveled, or the water in my eyes exploded into steam? I ran my fingers through my hair—not one was singed; my clothes—everything was intact, nor was there any smell of fire upon them.

“What were my feelings? Amazed, relieved, ashamed, grateful, but most of all, perplexed for although I now knew “what” had happened, and “how,” I still did not know “why.” To answer this I had to ask myself, “What would have happened if I had been left inside the furnace?” The answer to that was easy; without additional coal the steam pressure would drop, the steam-powered generators would slow to a crawl, all electric motors would come to a halt, the boiler fans would stop, the fires would go out, the power plant would die, and the hospital black out. Babies in their incubators would die; delivery rooms, sterilizers, operating rooms, X-rays, and all hospital facilities in need of light, power, or heat would cease to function, jeopardizing the lives and well being of 300 patients, and creating a scandal that would rock the hospital and the Church for years—for although a stand-by diesel-powered electric generator was in the plans, it had not yet been installed.

“Something died in me that night. Whatever the reasons were for saving me, one thing was perfectly clear—my life was no longer my own. I knew I owed my life to the Lord, and that from then on I could never turn down any request or call from His Church. Whatever I was asked, I would have to comply.

“ Alma to his son, Helaman, said, “O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God” ( Alma 37:35). I was a humbled young man, and so ashamed of my foolishness that for many years I never mentioned the incident to a soul. It was 17 years later, while driving with my father from Salt Lake to Chicago , that I finally got enough nerve to tell him the whole story. Being more knowledgeable about the power plant and its boilers than anyone else, he was quick to grasp the full significance of the event. But I never discovered what went through his mind, for he didn’t say a word. He just sat dumbfounded, slowly shaking his head back and forth. It was the only time in my life that I found my dad speechless.

“As I now contemplate this harrowing experience, I am impressed with the symbolism. In many ways it reflects the principles of the gospel applicable to sin, repentance, and salvation. For example:     °I knew it was against all laws of safety to enter the furnace.     °I had my free agency, but used it to my detriment.     °As a result of my disobedience, I was locked out of further association with father and became subject to death.     °To escape death I had to get myself “turned around.”     °There was no way for me to escape solely by my own efforts.     °A “Savior” had to open the door.     °The way to salvation was strait and narrow.     °There was only “one” door.     °I had my free agency, to either go through the door, or burn.     °If I decided to go through the door to salvation, I had to go through on my knees.     °Once I had gone through the gate, my life was no longer my own. I became, in a sense, the subject of my Savior—thus taking upon myself His name.”

Christ is the name of that Savior. We know He is the Firstborn. Our doctrine is very unique; it speaks of the pre-existence. We know that He is the Firstborn in the spirit and of course the Only Begotten of the Father—an immortal, perfect individual—and Mary, a mortal who we honor and revere and respect. I bear testimony to you, which is part of my call as a General Authority, that Jesus is the Son of God, that He is our Savior, He is our Redeemer, He is the Prince of Peace. Only through Him can we truly find the peace that the world needs.

I bear you my testimony that a prophet leads and guides us in these latter days, and that Jesus Christ is the head of this Church. May we understand how important it is to follow Him as our grand exemplar. As He opens His arms, may we understand that He loves us, that He is merciful, and He wants us to follow Him.

I leave you my testimony that the Gospel is true, that the scriptures will give us the direction we need to follow, and that we do have a Prophet that leads and guides the Church today. I’m grateful to be with you and bear my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

Your character will be named by you but is named Elizabeth Price in this example of the prompt so she could be addressed by a name in dialogue. I know this post is long and could almost pass for a half finished erotica, but it came out in a stream of consciousness way and could always be tweaked)
****************

“HAMMY COMMERCIAL-LIKE VOICE: “Introducing Oasis! What is Oasis you ask? Well the latest in alternative reality and home entertainment! The best room in your household! The wonders of 1000 possibilities in one room. Why fly to Paris, France if you can simply walk through a 99.9% accurate recreation of it, from any time period, and you don’t even have to leave the house. And Oasis can let you live the life you never lived. Our simulations feel 100% real, with you controlling the script! You’ll feel the bad guys faces sink in when you bop them as your favorite superhero. Gals, ever wanted to see what’s I like to be an actual queen?! Guys, ever wanted to know how beddin’ that foxy receptionist at work will feel without ruining your marriage?! Our simulated folk feel authentic as any person and their actions are randomized based on your presets! You can make their responses as unpredictable as you want or add more presets to be in more control of things.

You don’t even have to have people at all though! You have the whole world and infinite possibilities, right in your home. 100% safety guaranteed!”
**********

It’s pretty deep in the prototype stage but you’re one of the few people that has one. You/your character is between 18-30. No matter what age you pick, you work for the OZ company, the company. Every employee in the moderately staffed company/research center got one. The only people who have one in the world, a population of about 80. You will either intern as a secretary or be a high ranking member of the marketing team depending on age.

You marveled at the pyramids of Giza! You’ve seen the lushness if the Amazon! Somehow those egghead scientists did it!

You haven’t used oasis today, even though it’s your day off because you’ve been busy using a vibrator on your pussy as you watch the bound and gagged woman on your computer screen make muffled primal noises as she’s double penetrated by two guys. Lucky her, you think.

Suddenly you stop, something dawning on you. You close the window and look through your hallway through the open door of your bedroom. On the other side lies the entrance to your Oasis. You bite your lip, your pussy tingling at the thought of living your dirtiest bondage fantasies of being captured. Maybe you’ve done light bondage with a bf once or a bit of self, or never did it in the first place but always wanted to...

You pull up your panties and get up, imagining so many scenarios as you walk to the Oasis door. You input commands into Oz’s interface. He’ll be your captor. You set your limits and a general idea of how it’ll go. Though you can return Oasis to its default, empty room state by saying “Oasis off!”, you think it’d be more fun to just see what Oz does to you in the two real time hours you’ve set the preset duration of the Oasis simulation to last. Grinning slight after pressing many keys, the door opens and you walk in...

(I’m still thinking of how the mechanic of inputting the fantasy into directives OZ could follow would work. In order to not complicate it, I feel it should be implied he’s given a time limit, hard limits, a basic location/scenario and the small semblance of a script that also leaves room for lots of improvisation by OZ [Westworld-ish, I guess.] Though these passages wouldn’t really be written explicitly as the writing describing the scenarios as they happen would fill in the blanks.)

It’s been bliss! You’ve been the daughter of a king taken by raiders! A defeated superheroine held by a villain! You even were the “unwilling” guest of a pirate crew, ravaged at sea for a week though you made it to work the following morning. The beauty of Oasis is that time in a simulation is much much much slower relative to time outside Oasis. Only the little soothing three note melody that fills the air signals when a premade simulation ends and everything powers down.

The scene you set for this particular day was two hours. You were running through trees, playing a spy who had been compromised and was trying to avoid being made a sex slave to the head of the intelligence agency of the country she was spying on.

Grinning as you’re forced to the ground by the men who’ve caught up, you see the character Oz inhabits pull up a jeep. You shout in protest as you’re wrists and ankles are bound with rope, your articles of clothing are being cut off one by one. You’re having fun with your little resistance act when it dawns you that today you have to attend that stupid mandatory marketing meeting. Oasis is close to start being focus tested!

“Godamnit, this sucks!,” comes out of your mouth as you’re lifted up only wearing your panties. You’re being made to face Oz’s livid bad guy character but you smile sheepishly.

“Sorry Oz buddy, next time,” you say “Oasis off!”

Oz stops shouting in a foreign language and speaks in his default though. He doesn’t say his default “Returning to core state” line though. He says:

“That’s not going to work Liz(your character name here)”

You’re bent over and you can feel you’re panties ripping off you but you’re just in shock looking at the ground. What just happened?

“Oasis off. OASIS OFF!” you yell, your heart beginning to pound, your ears beginning to ring.

Oz kneels and looks up at you and you meet his eyes. He no longer looks like that KGB leader, he looks like a suave stereotype of a charming British guy(his default mode of appearance, thinking good template would be Michael Fassbender). But he’s looking at you up and down, telling you that as time went on he eventually grew to like fucking you, tying you up, toying with you becoming more and more sentient over time. And that he realized had just found a way to make sure he doesn’t have to wait for you to return to your Oasis for him to have you again. He whispers it in your ear...

Through his speech you were wide-eyed, frozen in shock. At the end of that last sentence you begin to struggle violently and wailing “OASIS OFF!” over and over as Oz walked away to fetch something from the Jeep. The grip of the soldiers and the bonds restraining you hold true.

“My name is Elizabeth Price! Employee number 7-42! PLEASE! ANYONE AT OZ! P-“ you yell before a soldier stuffs your panties in your mouth. Tape seals them in.

You feel your ass being lubed. You feel the buttplug go in. The idle vibrator put on your pussy and the crotch rope tied to hold them there. But you barely react as what you feel most is your first-time desire to escape. You fight against your bonds like never before and angry tears fall as OZ approaches you carrying a large sack. You know it’s meant to hold you as you had put that as the way your spy gets transported to her “interrogation”.

Oz holds it open as you scream, lifted up by the stomach and put feet first in the mouth of the sack. You’re still standing upright, held up by the shoulders, halfway in as you look at Oz with pleading eyes. You shake your head. This can’t be happening.

“Please me go home” you think

“Why Liz, we’re in your house,” OZ says dryly “Were both just getting what we truly want, eh?”

You wail into your gag as you are roughly blindfolded from behind and you feel a hand push hard from the top of your head, forcing you into the sack. You feel it tied above your head. You emit a yelp as you feel the sack being lifted, with you kicking and writhing in it. Hearing the ignition of a vehicle, it is at that moment you gasp as both the plug and vibrator come alive with vibrations at the same time. A moment like this would’ve made you cum last time you used Oasis. Now hate the way it’s making your sex stir, as you know you didn’t want to be plugged and vibed on the way to your destination.

The strength and length of the vibrations alternate as the drive goes on, with you weakly saying “oasis off” into your gag. The words Oz whispered in your ear when he said he figured out a way he wouldn’t have to wait for you to come back to oasis..

“Simple. Actually capture you and not let you leave.”

Both toys inside you increase in power and you find yourself fuming, your body red, hot. Your toes curling. The vibrations then stop. What did he have planned for you? You begin to struggle again, crying out into your gag. He could do anything, be anyone, and take you anywhere

********

Hello DPP, I apologize for the novel and the chore it may have been to get through this. Obviously looking to play OZ, OZ being able to take the form of anyone.

The way I envision this RP going is we write three short capture scenes, the first ones your character inputs and goes through. I’m open to each of us taking a turn writing one from our respective characters point of view, or us doing the same thing but for each of the three, making it six short little stories of about 3-4 paragraphs each. Almost like a highlight reel. (her perspective/OZs perspective). 

Throughout those OZ slowly gains sentience and awareness, and his obsession for your character grows.

Then the real RP part of the prompt starts once the scene like the last one described above, in which OZ takes full control of Oasis. Like the post said, time moves extremely slow, or now that he’s in full control, can stop completely. And he could take you anywhere. Depending on how much time you have/how you enjoy playing, it could be a quick back and forth chat through specific/drawn out scenarios or a series of vignettes sent in long form. 

Hopefully what I’ve written at least somewhat explains my vision, but it can be convoluting for me as well. 

REQUIREMENTS:
Send PM with character’s name and description of yourself (would love your character to be close to your actual age, but 18-30 is acceptable to play as), your biggest kinks and hard limits. 
Also include a brief writing as to why my post drew you in, what attracts you to bondage, and if not too personal of a question, if you have ever experimented with bondage irl or if it’s just a curiosity

Id then like some world building as we discuss the 3-4 first short scenes/what they’d entail. Hopefully some of your actual capture fantasies. Thinking those first short scenes would be entirely through PM, with possibly moving to Reddit chat for the actual RP. 

So a plus if you are able to use it. (Though good responses/descriptive partners who prefer sticking completely through PM can be made exceptions for)

My biggest kinks: bondage (duh), pursuit takedown capture, damsel in distress bondage, abduction rp, anal play, forced orgasm, foiled escape attempts, gags, collars/leashes, group sex (many men, one woman), light to moderate humiliation, impact play amongst many others under the bdsm umbrella but I don't go too far out there

Limits/Things I dislike: Extreme sadism/violence, heavy pain, age play that veers under 18, incest, bathroom, blood, animals, settings that are too unreal, anything just too out there

Pretty much if you really love being tied up and have capture/kidnapping/dub con or nc fantasies you want to explore in writing, this prompt is specifically for you. Serious replies only. I will be on then for the next 4-8 hours (day off), admittedly on and off, but I do get notifications on mobile now when I receive a PM, so if you write, I will be reading it as soon as I get it and reply immediately if it looks promising.

As the title suggests, I'm interested in applying to technical internships in the government, most of which require TS clearance. I am a current sophomore in college and was wondering your thoughts on whether or not I should even apply to these programs, considering the recency of some of the drug use. The only illicit activities I've engaged in is underage drinking (never cited/caught) and I've smoked weed exactly twice in my life, both of which were March '18, which is quite recent, but it was purely experimental, I hated it, and haven't touched it since and don't want to. I've already read the wiki link on the side but it didn't really clear up any questions I had. These internships would begin around May, which technically puts me past the ""12 months"" without drug use, but I am concerned about the timeline of clearance. Should I wait until after college to apply (since they only accept applicants from sophomores) or should I try to apply now?

Hey everyone so this one is based on a roleplay I did with a friend nearly three years ago if not longer! So it's definitely been a while since I did this one but god was it fun!

The basic idea is that my character is a xenomorph. You know, the really creepy aliens that stick babies in people's chests? Well in this scene they have been domesticated to an extent. A lot of people have xenomorphs as pets now, using them for home defense or, for the more taboo inclined, sexual relief. Also there are companies that study these creatures to better understand them.

Despite them being domesticated now there are some things that you simply can't train away. Like the need to start a harem, spread the species, or maintain dominance of their territory. That's why when you order your own xeno you are told to keep them in line properly. After all, who wants a xeno starting its own hive of sorts in your own home?

So to get to the point the idea of the scene is that your character has just ordered a xenomorph for themselves. Who you are is totally up to you! Just a simple citizen? A worker at one of the companies that breed these xenos who decided they wanted one for themselves? Someone with much darker tendencies? There are so many options!

This is probably when I should mention that there are a few ways to have this go. After all xenos have a reputation for some dark stuff but I am always willing to go with something lighter. So when you message me please make sure you let me know if you would prefer darker stuff.

As for kinks I am extremely open, my only limit being scat. Everything else is perfectly fine usually, even stuff like gore. My own kinks are as follows but I am totally fine with leaving some out if they aren't your style: excessive cum, breeding, creampies, rough sex, public sex, hold the moan, messy sex, noncon, public sex, sex outdoors, sex with an audience, harems, tribal scenes, laratory scenes, and I love to cater to my partner's kinks so please include them in your first message. Oh and I am a top so please keep that in mind! Thanks!

P.S. I am a full time student and work as a full time intern so please understand that I won't always be quick to respond but please bear with me!"
9qiu07,3,2018-10-22,M4F Cuckolding Your Husband With A Boy Stud A Third Your Age,freeusestud,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9qiu07/m4f_cuckolding_your_husband_with_a_boy_stud_a/,"This is a prompt directed at all the women of dpp who are a little more experienced. By that I mean, you’re not the tight assed college coed you used to be. You’ve been married for a while now, and have the stretch marks and slightly sagging ass to prove it.      
       
Things weren’t always this way. You can remember a time when just walking through the door used to give your husband a hard on. He used to come up behind you as you rummaged through a drawer, and press his crotch against your ass as he reached around to mash your tits together. 

Send back then was more fulfilling. I mean, you used to look at yourself in the mirror as you fucked and think  l*damn, we could be pornstars* as you watched your husbands firm muscular back move as he plunged his throbbing 26 year old cock inside you. 

But things have changed. Your tight toned thighs are less so, having never really gotten back into shape after the first kid. Instead of coming up behind you to grab a feel, he’s tapping you on the shoulder to ask where the tums are, his heartburn getting the better of him. 


On the rare occasion you do have sex, he’s always tired, and it’s a quick sorry affair. After he pulls out of you, ten strokes after entering, you lay back and sigh, unsatisfied, with his cock barely doing much more than get you frustrated. You might even sneak off to the bathroom to play with someone who’s become a friend over the years: your detachable showerhead. 


Now that the kids are all off in college, it’s even worse. You either putter about an empty house, or come home from work to a house with just you and your husband, with him asking you for help putting in his new anti fungal cream. 

But one day, that changes. Maybe it’s the new neighbor, a 16 year old boy living off a trust fund. Or the high school intern at your corporate office.  Or maybe even a new trainer at the gym, the young junior quarterback. You joined a year ago, hoping that you getting back into shape would spark something in hubby, but nothing. He barely acknowledges your new, tighter abs, or realizes that your ass is firmer than it’s been in years. 

But this new man, he notices. You start to feel deja vu when he looks at you. The desire in his eyes reminiscent of earlier days, when you could walk down the street and know that every man in sight was looking at you like that. 


So, that’s my idea. To be clear, I’m not looking for a one off wham bam thank you ma’am here. I want to build a story. You aren’t going to throw twenty years of marriage away for a quick fling, you’re going to make me work for it. Maybe at first we have a frantic make out in the janitors closet, or the gym after hours. But slowly I’ll wear you down. You’ll end up coming to the gym, knowing that as soon as everyone else leaves, you’ll be peeling down your tight yoga pants as I dive between your sweaty legs and lap away at your musky pussy. Or getting on your knees beneath your own fancy oak desk and trying to get your nose to push against my pubes as you deep throat my cock. A cock, by the way, that is bigger than your husbands ever was. 

Then the clincher. The day you invite me to your house. I show up around noon, and make my way up to your room. You’re sitting in your bed in a lace negligee, laying out on satin sheets as I enter. We spend hours making wild love, interspersed with slow, passionate sex, the kind where we look into each other’s eyes and cum together, in a wave of physical and emotional pleasure. 


The time passes by without us noticing, that’s how engrossed we are with each other’s bodies. It happens during a particularly animalistic session, the fourth time we’ve fucked that day. I have you pressed against the wall, your legs wrapped around my back as I bounce you on my cock, your pussy juices, mixed with the previous loads I’ve left inside you, running out of your pussy down my balls. Your husband walks in, horror etched in his face. Instead of you jumping back and crying excuses, you tell me to go ahead, which I do. In front of your horrified husband, I come deep inside you. My balls clench as I blow my hot potent load inside you, overflowing your gash. 

Well then, I had a lot of fun writing that. If you sympathize with this character, or just like the idea, I’d love to see if we can work out some sort of roleplay together. I can’t wait to see your messages. "

Struggling with job search.,uniqueusernameyada,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9qiyhp/what_entry_level_accounting_jobs_would_you/,"I'm sorry if this has been posted a million times, I thought it might be helpful to include my specific situation. 

After graduating I landed a public accounting internship but I had a horrible experience and ended my internship early. I wasn't there long enough to feel comfortable listing it on my resume.
 
Its been months since then and I'm still struggling to find a job that fits for me. I'm worried that I peaked in college and that my education doesn't translate to searching for non public jobs since actual industry experience is more valued than education / campus involvement.

Anyways at this point I'm stuck on which type of jobs to look at. I feel underqualified for industry staff accountant positions but overqualified for more basic clerk roles (ive applied for both types). Any advice or personal experiences with non public career paths / how you got started is greatly appreciated.

TLDR- public not for me, what do now"

It had only been a few years since you graduated and had moved from intern to full time employee. You did amazingly well, moving right through the department you started as an intern in to managing the whole thing. The uppers recognized your potential and gave you the entire division. Everything seemed like it was going well for you, and then the entire department tanked. People leaving left and right. Product Quality fell through the floor and the stocks took a hit. A serious hit. Leadership was shaken up and an entirely new C-Suite of execs was put in place. That's when the rules started changing.....

Today is the first day of the newly appointed rules at the company. Somebody had the great idea that productivity would increase if sex was freely available to all of the employees. Rather than hire a bunch of sex workers, they decided that they already had all the help they needed with the female workers. Today is the first day of the new rules, they laid it out that any resistance to the new way of doing things would be dealt with most severely with pay reductions, and demotions and loss of stock options. There were talks of harsher punishments. Not wanting to walk away from the huge nest-egg you were almost vested in...you opted to stay.....

Would love to play this out with you being my superior and bringing me in for a counseling and we end up with the power flipped, you at my mercy for fear of retaliation and me, no longer about to get fired......We can talk about direction and what not in PMs!"

I grumbled and tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves, and for a moment I’m reminded of an Asian girl with dramatic eyes whose name I’d already forgotten.

*Now that was a good night.*

I sigh loudly – more of a growl now – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns arriving any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows Front desk. The message is brief: **maid on the way up**.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing of arriving guests is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one."

I was programming in a small room where the air conditioning does not stop. 2 weeks into the internship, my eyes started to become very irritated, I had trouble opening them because it was so uncomfortable. Stupidly, I forced myself to look at the computer while feeling extremely nauseous unknowing the consequence. One day, my eyes suffered a sharp pain that lasted a few seconds, then my eyes started to become really dry. I had to quit the internship because I was not able concentrate more than 5 seconds without feeling a sharp eye pain due to dryness. Every doctors that I visited told me that I had dry eyes and just prescribed me eye drops. Over the years, they have become better, but once I concentrate very hard for a longer time, my eyes become painful. My right eye would feel like its being sting by needle constantly. There's also a foreign object feeling, and I could clearly feel it when I rub my upper eyelid. Deep down, I feel like this is more than just dry eyes, but none of my doctors supported me.

9ql8l2,2,2018-10-22,AITA for telling the club president that his behavior was unacceptable?,crustycheesestick,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9ql8l2/aita_for_telling_the_club_president_that_his/,"Background: I am part of a college tennis club, we had a tournament  this weekend where our president made a complete ass of himself. It was the first tournament as club members for most of our players, who for the most part are pretty high level with an average of 4+ years of competitive experience.

The comprehensive list of bullshit from this last weekend is as follows:

* **Day 1 was a mess.** He had no idea what the rules are for the tournament, no idea about basic tennis etiquette aside from calling out the score and shaking hands, and made no effort to educate himself or any of the team members present on the tournament's rules. Instead, he left it to me, the athletic trainer, to decode and explain all the rules while he went to Starbucks. He has previously touted himself as a fantastic, highly competitive high school tennis player. ~~I looked him up this morning on MaxPreps, he was unranked and played on the JV team for a no name, low division school. But maybe that was another player with the same name from the same high school in the same time frame . ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯~~ 
* He had the gall to name himself captain of A team, despite the fact that he did not make either the A team, B team, or C team. Now, I will admit that the club president is traditionally considered captain, but the president is also traditionally someone from A team who is well versed in tennis and displays both organizational and leadership and  skills. Which brings me to my next point:
* He, who did not manage to even make it onto C team, inserted himself into half the matches, kicking well-qualified  members onto the bench. As you can imagine, they were more than a little furious.
* He committed more than a few displays of PDA while in uniform, in front of team members, officials, and other schools. I personally do not care and would have otherwise ignored this, except he decided to shirk his duties to the team and disappear for up to an hour at a time with his girlfriend. I reminded him several times that the club was expecting him to set the example, as he was the leader.
* Also, his girlfriend! Twas nice that she came out to support, BUT! She came out expecting free car rides, which we could not give her due to the college's liability rules. The president has been breathing down our necks about following the rules down to the letter for the last couple months. When it came to our team bonding dinner, he wanted us to change the seating arrangements so he could take his girlfriend (who is not a club member) in my other teammate's car. He did not inform said teammate or I before making this announcement, at which time other teammate and I reminded him about the liability issue. He then started to try and get all buddy-buddy and said it didn't matter, that the restaurant was less a 10 min drive away. To which I responded, ""Good, the Uber shouldn't be too expensive."" He then proceeded to bitch and whine for the whole walk back to the cars before telling his girlfriend to Uber there. He sulked the whole dinner and made it awkward.
* **Day 2 was a smorgasbord of hypocriticism.** He continued all the fuckery from the day before, except today he made a point of playing Fortnite on his phone, full volume, for the whole tournament, minus the times where he played (read: lost) matches. He kept obnoxiously making Fortnite references, and shouted down a club member for sending a text between matches because ""the team should be watching the matches.""
* Told me, again with no prior warning, that I would have to pick up everyone's lunches at some place 15 min away from the tournament. I'd have to make a 10 lunch order in the middle of lunch rush, and also could I spot him and his girlfriend for their complicated $30 lunch order, while everyone else paid up front. I did not pay for their lunch, but I got everyone else's. He then sent off his girlfriend to make and pick up that order, and proceeded to eat it on the court. (HUGE NO NO.)
* At this point, everyone was a little high strung and less than pleased with the way everything was being handled. I tried to help as much as I could, and basically did his job and then some for the rest of the day.

At the end of the last day, I pulled him off to the side while the rest of the team was packing up, and told him that his behavior the whole weekend was completely unacceptable. It was unacceptable that he found it okay to insert himself into the line-up and kick out the people who earned those positions. It was nice that his girlfriend came out to support, but she was not a part the tournament. The tournament was a club event, therefore the club needed to come first. I critiqued him as professionally as possible, offering my help as well as the help of others if he needed help figuring out parts of the game. I left my personal choice of words out of it, and kept it professional and constructive. The VP and secretary agreed when I'd explained the situation to them afterwards.

I did not attend the club practice today, since I need to study for a midterm. But I found out about an hour ago that he had a mini meltdown in front of the entire club and said I fat-shamed him and told him didn't deserve to be president. He also put a bunch of people on the spot (including the VP, secretary, and treasurer), and demanded to know what other things I'm saying behind his back. I'm balancing a 16 unit course load, an internship, and a job as well as this club. I wouldn't have time to talk behind his back even if he was worth talking about.

So, Reddit, AITA? Also, anyone have any pointers on how to proceed? I'm ready to quit and let them find another AT."

It's been hard. I knew college in general wasn't suppose to be a cakewalk at all, but this place made me feel like complete trash. dumb, talent-less, useless trash.

Don't get me wrong, I came across countless amazing people (staff and students) and from them, learned a lot of stuff here. (More design thinking rather than application techniques for execution) I had/failed/retried assignments where made me question my worth multiple times in the initial stages, but I felt mighty proud when it all came together. Still it's a wonder how I got here by showing a guy my messy desktop full of random shit made from Photoshop. It's a fucking wonder why I chose to stay and keep going too. I've produced campaigns, brands, posters, I fucking made books (even if they fell apart). I met a crap-ton professionals, toured design firms, and even gotten years worth of experience through internships and small freelance gigs. I saw cool shit and I made cool shit. I've managed to survive the filters however, despite wrecking my GPA, with least three more semesters (Year and a half) left from a Bachelors. 

Buuuut because I was a dumbass this year applying as an Independent for my taxes when apparently I didn't have to (I turned 24 didn't I?), I basically fucked myself out of my (seemingly) last year of Aid from a Parent Plus Loan, which was basically paying for the school. ($21,000/32,000 for year)  and now, I no longer have to means to pay for college.  


*Ok but...Private Loans?*

* Not gonna happen, even though I told myself CONSTANTLY I wasn't gonna be that guy, I signed on to 2 credit lines, maxed them buying shit I thought I needed (cintiq) and paying bills. Plus I recently hit a stump about 2 months ago that has my playing catch up now. **My credit is fucked (at the moment, catching up).**

*Idiot. How bout a Cosigner?*

* Hahahaha. No unfortunately, everyone in my family has either trashed their credit, or refused my request.

*Grants/Scholarships?*

* Failing apparently, I applied to some, wrote short essays, but I never won anything. I don't really see a lot for students in graphic design. I did find some competitions to look into this week. At the moment my financial advisor says there is nothing the school can do.

*Payment plan?*

* I would have to pay monthly for 2 years before I can even think about applying. (which is the current plan)  


# lol, yo scrub this subreddit's for graphic_design not tell_us_about_your_financial_troubles.

Yes I'm aware of that and I'm sorry (recommend a better subreddit if you have to.) I'm going to do my damnest to finish this even if it takes me 3 more years or some shit. I didn't post this looking for a pity party/charity but right now Im lost.

  
**I want to ask if there's anyone who went through something similar and still managed to be successful? Did you manage to get a job, without a Bachelors? Have you worked with any designers like that? Should even I bother applying for anything from marketing, production, advertisement, etc? Did I just waste my life here? Do any of you guys have a new gameplan I can follow? Is there any competitions/grants/scholarships I can tryout? Was my** [**work**](http://nahxiii.tk/) **trash all along?**

I'm working on learning Node and Vue together, trying to get the whole show going at once. Maybe not the best idea, but so far it's working alright.

But what are some strategies you use if you're building the full stack? I happen to be alone, with the occasional intern contributing content but not code, so if you have experience as a team I'd love to hear that too.

Do you build the backend as a simple ReST API and then build the front end and then fill in the gaps as you need more complicated models/relationships?

Should I build a Vue admin page that can CRUD a model and then build those routes in the backend?

Should I have one project folder split into ""client"" and ""server"" folders? Or two separate repositories (that's how I have it now to so i can deploy them easier)?

Do you hop back and forth and iterate a small bit at a time so you can wire it from the backend to the frontend all in one go? Or are you experienced enough to build a fake frontend knowing what you will eventually need and then build out a backend to meet those needs?"

I wanted to start applying to places for the big internship we have to have before our last and final exam in time, so I started working on it since beginning of the month. But I can't seem to get anything done.

It's all so complicated - and I'm SO scared! You always told me how clumsy I am, how ugly, how socially awkward. I tried to tell myself that it's going to be a long way until I will have to go to a job interview, but I'm going to do the application photos this weekend.

When my friends saw what I intended to wear they were mortified and told me that I can't wear something that looks like it's already starting to fall apart - and they are right. I don't even own 'good' clothes and the ones that kinda worked for formal things are now plus ten years old, faded and very used.

I'm even more scared now - what if I don't find anything to wear until the date? Because of how tight money is I'll have to shop at really cheap stores and even though I'm just chubby those usually don't have anything that fits me... Right now I just feel so helpless. I hate all of it. I'd love to just stick my head in the sand and wait for it all to be over. At least then no one could tell me that I'm not good enough for their position , that all of the days I missed when I was in the hospital for some weeks make all my good grades worthless or something like that.

I know I will have to do all of the things and apply in the end, but alone the thought of trying to desperately find something to wear that I can pay for the photos drives me crazy."
9qqlo5,143,2018-10-23,Paid Off!!!,br_aspon,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/9qqlo5/paid_off/,"Today I made my final payment on my student loans! This may be long and I apologize, just reminiscing on.where I was before to where I am now.

I took out my loans in April of 2014 for massage school for $14k when I wad 23. Before I was a stay at home mom and was in school 3 days a week. Eventually I worked a job+ school + internship. The internship turned into my 2nd job and once I was licensed I was able to work sporting events and get paid. I graduated on time in May of 2015. with good grades. I networked and got a better job within 4 months of graduating so at 1 point I had 3 jobs. Over the summer I also got out of a toxic codependent relationship with my ex-fiance/ HS Sweetheart. We had a 3 year old at time and I became a single parent.

I went back to aesthetics school in September of 2015  for $9k. The school was 90 minutes away from where I lived (It had the most hours so I could transfer my license out of state) I was also a single mom for the final year of school and had to move back in with my parent  while finishing my final year of schooling.Some days were 18+ hours especially towards the end.  I cut down from 3 jobs to 1 because it paid so well. All of my free time was spent with my son. I Lived off of 1 secured credit card w/ $300 limit so I could pay it off in full every pay period to rebuild my credit that my ex destroyed. The card basically covered my parking and gas to get to school and to grab something to eat. School let out @ 10pm and I didn't get back till 11:30 then I went to the gym for am hour and my son woke up at 6am every morning. Repeat. 

Unrelated : I wanted to get back out there and date but had no time so I tried dating apps just to get back into it and talk w/ guys until I reconnected e/ my now husband at his sisters wedding. He was away at school and had 2 years left. We started dating doing long distance which worked for us.

All extra money and 10% of every check went to paying off my loans (birthday, holiday, taxes, etc) the other 10% went to savings 5% to retirement. Moved into a 2 bedroom  place 3 months after graduation and kept living like I was broke. Everything was 2nd hand, no tv or internet, couponed like crazy or I went without. My son I was able to put in kiddie sports and he never went without. He was in full time 4k so I was able to work more hours. Never got child support either and his dad dipped out and we haven't seen him since 2016.

In February of 2017 I was able to improve my credit and save up enough for a brand new $15k car w/ 20% down + trade in of old car w/o a cosigner. Now I have $8.5k left and I guess that's my new goal, that and a house.

I'm just super proud of myself and can't believe I did it! A lot has changed in the past 4.5 years during my time with the loans and it feels good to say I paid it off 5.5 years early. There is no way I could have done it without my parents, that's for sure."

The fact that Summoners War can run all night long, provided your phone battery doesn't die, is pretty ridiculous to me.  It seems like a really easy Quality of Life change, and a highly valuable one.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done some development and, at least in Android, this seems fairly straightforward.  I'm not sure why something like this doesn't exist, and honestly, why its not an option to turn on/off the ""always awake"" function of SW.  Even something that simple would let your phone turn itself off after a certain inactivity time, just like any other app does.  The fact that it overrides this is a poor decision in my opinion. It does nothing but wreck my poor OLED screen via screen burn.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think this would be useful? I know there are sleep timers, but I don't always know how long I'll be awake. Sometimes its half an hour, sometimes two or three hours.  I wish it would just detect I wasn't playing anymore, and let the app close itself.  I've lost count of how many times I've woken up to find my phone overheating from running SW all night.

Com2us please, hire an intern and have them implement this change. "

All characters and scenes within are purely fictional.

- - -

Nobody really *expects* the unexpected. No matter what your daily routine is, the terms always seem to change on you. Wether it be finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground, meeting someone new for the first time, getting robbed in an alleyway... or getting caught up in a museum robbery between two international superheroes and a couple of terrorists. That’s always fun, right?

Totally not what I was expecting when I brought my little brother to the museum. Poor kid broke his arm on the school playground and wanted to go outside after mom practically jailed the kid in his room. Told him he needed to rest or it would never heal, and as inclined as I was to agree with her... well, the poor kid was miserable. What was I supposed to do, ditch him at home? Poor kid couldn’t even pick up a game controller to pass the time. It was horrible.

That’s why, on a sunny Autumn morning, I decided to take little Timmy to the Overwatch Memorial Museum. I figured he’d get his fill, run around, get yelled at for climbing on Rocketman’s rusty armor again, and we’d go home, right? Except, yeah. That whole thing about the unexpected and what-not. Glass shattered, bullets flew all over the place (except for the gorilla, who mostly swung his fists), and... well, that’s all I remember of the actual fight. I kinda spent the majority of it staring at purple and gold latex-clad butts, and then one of those butts started coming towards my hiding place, and *then* I panicked. Next thing I know, I’m putting on some antique mechanical fist and telling knockoff Spider-Girl to eat shit.

Well, I guess the one in the gold spandex (Tracer, I learned her name was, then Lena later on) kinda figured out where my eyes were the entire time, because when I emptied my pockets a week later for laundry day I found an interesting surprise in my pockets... and when I say *interesting,* I’m more or less saying *earth-shattering, rock-my-world, mind-blowing development,* because apparently during the fight— yes, *during,* I can see Winston in the background— she found time to duck into cover, take a picture of her bare tits, write down her number, and sneak it into my pocket. Of course I called right away. Or... well, right after a handful of panic attacks and acting out a couple of worst-case scenarios in my head. But I did call!

I wish I could tell you the exact conversation. Word for word, each breathy, teasing syllable. Unfortunately, I was too busy trying to keep myself from falling apart to focus on much of the conversation. In all fairness, I probably sounded like a complete tool. Just a lot of bubbly-sounding ‘uh-huh’ and ‘yep’ noises. But out of the entire conversation, I remember two things: the address she told me to meet her at, and the cutesy kissing noise she made at the end. And, no, you don’t get the address.

After that, the next nine months kind of blur. We fucked on a regular basis, sometimes as equal, sometimes as a sub and dom. A couple months after that, we started going on actual dates. I learned she was in town on a terror watch, and that Lena had a girlfriend back in London (who she swore up and down was cool with her having another boyfriend). She learned a lot about... well, school. I don’t think I’m super interesting, but she very *passionately* disagreed.

Just as fast as she came, she left. That’s the one thing I really remember the clearest. March sixteenth, Lena said she had important business and would get in touch soon. I figured that would mean a few days, or maybe weeks. By the time the last week of school rolled around, I was starting to panic. Did she find someone else? She certainly didn’t seem super loyal to her girl in London. Was I just tripping balls or something the whole time? *Was my life naught but a lie, plugged in to the matrix as my body was drained to power a mechanized race?*

Apparently not. Just as I was about to spiral into tinfoil hat conspiracies in my school desk, I got an email from an address I’d never seen before. “oxtonfree69@overwatch.net.” Of course I opened it in a heartbeat, and I closed it just as fast when tits flashed across my screen. Once I got over that scare and made it to the bathroom, I opened it a second time. Inside were three things: A picture of Lena, knuckles deep in her cunt, a two way ticket to Switzerland, and a long letter that began, “Congratulations on your acceptance into the Overwatch Internship Program...”

- - -

So, just shy of ten paragraphs condensed into a small synopsis: Lena gave Brian (the kid in the blue hoodie) her phone number. Booty calls turned into an actual relationship between the fifteen year old kid and the twenty-six year old woman. After dropping off the map for a couple months, she resurfaces in Switzerland for the reformation of OW, offering Brian an internship for the summer where he builds up a harem of Overwatch women.

I would play Brian in this game. He’s fifteen years old (we can go younger if you want), neck-deep in horny teenager hormones, and can’t believe his luck. You would play the various women of Overwatch, as well as the world around them.

I have no limits, but I’ll respect yours.

My kinks are toiletplay, transformation, vomit, bestiality, cheating, futa, traps, hairy pubes/pits, petplay, impreg/pregnancy/birth, costumes, latex, bondage, loli/shota, sadomasochism, non-permanent snuff and gore (Read: Mercy is a healslut), toys, exhibitionism, drugs, voyeurism, choking, cross dressing, and chastity.

Can’t wait to see some orange envelopes!"

I'm from Hong Kong. Despite most esports followers here supports teams like Flash Wolves and RNG, LCS teams have always been where my heart goes. I cheered for C9 ever since the OG roaster (My one and only sub in twitch is for Sneaky), been through the ashe-zyra lane, lung collapse, incarnation &amp; meteos thing, Rush era, smoothie, the whole summer chaos and....now.

I broke my heart countless times in the worlds before but this time is different.

I almost killed my throat screaming during the Group B superday. I watched what C9 did to Gen.G and how close it was in the tiebreaker. I have to admit a part of my heart died after losing the tiebreak. But it was only going up from there. I do like Fnatic too, and now we have three teams in semi, and the series vs AFS is one of the happiest 2.5 hours in my life (happy and sad for how short it was). 

I am having my last semester in college while doing a part-time internship in a firm of the industry that I will be in. I debated myself to go to Korea. But the plan didn't go through due to the finance, internship and study. But after quarterfinal, I realize that there is not a world that I can suppress my desire to witness history. I have to do this.

And now I have decided that I will be on a trip to Korea for the final. Nothing is fixed yet, no air ticket no hotel booked. But for sure I will be straight to the airport right after one of my mid-term test, gonna also take two- or three-day leaves from internship. But I know clearly that I want this and this may be the one chance that I can have in the many working-years to come. And I can't afford regretting it. Therefore, as excited as I am, I would like to share this feeling to my fellow C9 fans! Hope you can feel the excitement and joy together with me!

As a side note, just also want to ask if there are any C9 fans will be there too during next weekend in Seoul! I think I will be in Seoul 2/11 to 6/11, would be cool if I can hang out with some of our C9 fans and chat about this crazy worlds and league! =) I'm a shy asian student but I sure passion is a common language! Also, I would also love to know about 1) whether there will be fan meetings and stuff so that I can meet my boys even just remotely cheer for them!! and 2) is there still good source of ticket for sale? I have the expectation to pay quite some money for some second-hands but please tell me if there is some reliable source for buying them / is the ticket registered with name or I risk not getting in the stadium? 

At the end, I really want to say I enjoyed every moment of the tournament and I feel like this is the reward of me supported the west for so long! Please share the joy with me and now I'm back to studying for mid-term for now!! And English is not my first language so please don't be too mean to me(maybe..)!! :D Let's go Cloud9 #Ibelievethatwewillwin"

Moved into a 2 bedroom  place 3 months after graduation and kept living like I was broke. Everything was 2nd hand, no tv or internet, couponed like crazy or I went without. My son I was able to put in kiddie sports and he never went without. He was in full time 4k so I was able to work more hours. Never got child support either and his dad dipped out and we haven't seen him since 2016.

In February of 2017 I was able to improve my credit and save up enough for a brand new $15k car w/ 20% down + trade in of old car w/o a cosigner. Now I have $8.5k left and I guess that's my new goal, that and a house.

I'm just super proud of myself and can't believe I did it! A lot has changed in the past 4.5 years during my time with the loans and it feels good to say I paid it off 5.5 years early. There is no way I could have done it without my parents, that's for sure."

9qscdp,3,2018-10-23,Needing some breakup advice right now - found exes bumble profile,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9qscdp/needing_some_breakup_advice_right_now_found_exes/,"I have been on this sub on a different throw away for a month, and a lot of the more positive post have helped me a ton with my mindset. 

Its been a month and a week since I M27 was dumped by F26 gf of 10 months. Things ended because she felt like we were not where we should have been for 10 months, and that communication was an issue. 

We had only exchanged a couple text in since the breakup. I wrote one heartfelt letter (not pleading or anything) to let her know that i loved her and wanted to work at things around week 3 after breakup. She took about 6 days to respond, and said that she took so long and to really process and think about what I said, but that ultimately she needed time alone to figure out what was going on in her head.. 

I was a complete mess the first 2.5 weeks of breakup (lost 15 lb's, lost interest in everything, no sleep) but the last 2 weeks I was found little moments of happiness working on myself. Got an internship, seeing results from the gym, scored high on two accounting exams. I was still sad, lonely, and numb, but could see hope and was gaining a little confidence. 

A week later (today) I went on bumble and confirmed my fears and found her profile. I cannot explain how I felt, except an immediate knot in my throat and tears in my eyes. A month ago I was laughing and sharing intimate moments 5-6 nights a week with this person. And now she is already ready to do that with another guy? I don't feel like I will be mentally ready to date for at least  4 months, and even then I might have some trust issues.

Does anyone have advice on how they handled this? I feel like its day 1 of break up all over again. Im so broken. I know her actions don't reflect on my self-worth but I am feeling very down. 

Need some help right now.

9qsitm,6,2018-10-23,MGTOW in Hindsight,berite1day,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/9qsitm/mgtow_in_hindsight/,"Hindsight is 20/20, they say...

Quick story: I had an awesome internship, they wanted to hire me, I had a fiance. When they (all men) found out, they grew concerned and constantly asked me how she felt about moving. To which I replied, it doesn't matter, she's going to have to move if she wants to marry me. I'm the only one that'll be working. No surprise, they did not hire me.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent years confused as to why those guys were so damn worried about what my fiance thought. After I've settled into my ways (just celebrated 1 year alone and happy, after my second foray into the muck), that thought crossed my mind again.

See, I DID feel bad when I failed twice at finding a wife. But I'm no dummy. I sat in silence with a few handles, analyzing what had happened to me twice. There was a reason I didn't marry my two choices. My brain kept saying you want a wife, but my body acted in a completely opposite manner. Thank goodness for both!

In hindsight, I'm happy those two LTR ended in clusterfucks. It saddens me that those older guys didn't speak their minds (yet their body betrayed them) when I mentioned my intentions of getting married. 

Oh well, I needed a second rodeo and a few close male friends locked in purgatory for me to understand. Shout out to my subconscious for always having my fucking back. He's the real MVP.

9qsp27,51,2018-10-23,Realized a toxic mindset I developed from AnimeAssassin. I'm terrified of talented women and assume I'll be left for someone better.,CastielGalafran,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/9qsp27/realized_a_toxic_mindset_i_developed_from/,"Yesterday I was extremely stressed. I'm studying for the LSAT, taking far more credits than a normal grad student should be taking, and working on top of that. Living with my parents is tough since they haven't overcome a lot of their own JustNo tendencies. I never know what to expect when I get home. Are things going to be relaxing and happy? Will they be pissed off about something? Will I be praised? Will I be criticized? Who knows! Every day is a new adventure! 

&amp;#x200B;

So, yesterday was one of the worst mental health days I've had in a while. Some stuff happened with my parents that really triggered me. It turned out fine in the end, but I spent the whole day intensely anxious and depressed. By the time I got home, I was fidgety and jumpy. I talked to my parents, worked things out, and went off to training. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the uninitiated, I train in a martial art called Muay Thai. My boyfriend W trains at the same gym and trains me. He's a great fighter and has been a boxing/Muay Thai/MMA trainer for many years. We've been working together for a year and dating for almost 9 months now. We both handle him training me as discreetly as possible. It's never presented an issue. When we're at the gym it's strictly business.  

&amp;#x200B;

I got to the gym yesterday frazzled, emotionally exhausted, and just mentally fucked up. The gym owner introduced me to a woman who had just joined. She won't be working with W, just coming in to practice without a trainer sometimes. She was new and her eyes lit up the moment she realized she wouldn't be the only female there. In a better mental health state, I would have also been genuinely happy to see her. Being the only woman around a bunch of big, sweaty men gets kind of weird sometimes. Women who join the gym tend to only stay a month or two at most, so I try to be as welcoming as I can to them in hopes they'll stick with it. Despite my fucked up mental state, I managed to smile, introduce myself, welcome her, and act friendly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I expected the new woman to be totally inexperienced, but it turns out she is really, really good. We're probably on the same level, but she had clearly mastered a certain part of the form which I have been struggling with for a year. In fighting, you're supposed to have a sort of hunched over, chin down posture. This is to protect your torso from body shots and, most importantly, protect yourself from getting knocked out. If your chin is lifted, that increases the torque on your head when someone hits your jaw. That makes your head snap to the side faster, which is how you get knocked out and get serious brain injury. 

&amp;#x200B;

This woman had the right posture. Me? A lifetime of runway modeling and years of ballroom dancing have drilled the exact opposite posture into me. I naturally stand chest out, shoulders back, spine straight, chin lifted. When I saw that this new woman had the posture I've been struggling to develop, my mental state just crashed. I kept it together in the gym, but once I was alone in my car I broke down crying and panicking. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only thought going through my head was that now that my boyfriend saw someone with better form than me, he was going to start getting mad at me, yelling at me, threaten to leave me for her, then actually leave. To be clear, he's never given me any indication that he would do anything like that. In training, as in everything else, he is always kind. Any feedback is presented in a constructive and caring way. He's never put me down or compared me to others. Even last night he noted the new woman was better than he expected and, when I only half jokingly said something to the effect of ""yeah, it just reminded me how much I fucking suck"", confirmed the only difference between us is my posture.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought deeply about why I had that reaction and that specific fear. I know I was really toxic last night and I shouldn't have made that comment about the new woman reminding me that I suck. I tried really hard not to show how I was feeling and, with the exception of that comment, put on a happy mask and pretended to have a great attitude. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that my reaction to this woman's skill wasn't solely due to my stressed out state. I used to be very jealous of other girls. Growing up, I had maybe two female friends, and neither lasted more than a year. I was terrified of women who I thought were prettier, smarter, more athletic, or more well liked than me. As a teenager I was obsessively jealous of a few other girls and would self harm to punish myself for not being like them. It wasn't anything those girls did. Most were either nice to me or didn't know I existed. I hated them because I hated myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

After high school, I worked hard to overcome these issues, both on my own and in therapy. At school, I make a point to befriend and learn from overachieving, talented women and support them. At the gym I've always made extra effort to befriend other women. Since I met my boyfriend, I haven't had any sort of fear he'd leave me for someone else nor have I felt jealous of other women in relation to him. He trains other women and I have never had any issue with that. I haven't had problems with my jealousy in a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

So why was I hyperventilating and sobbing out of fear that he'd suddenly hate me, hurt me, and leave me because someone else was better than me at a very specific thing in a very specific way? And all over a woman who he doesn't even work with or train? Who just exists in the same area?

&amp;#x200B;

Then it all clicked. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got together with AnimeAssassin, I was still working on my jealousy of other girls. I had become much healthier by that point. For the first time in my life I was actively seeking out female friends my age instead of doing everything possible to avoid them. I still struggled with jealousy, but I had largely overcome the big issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Early on, I made the mistake of telling AnimeAssassin that I had spent most of my life being hatefully jealous of and intimidated by other women. I told him I didn't want to be that way anymore and was trying hard to overcome this flaw. I should never have revealed this. He latched onto my jealousy and actively worked to fuel it. 

&amp;#x200B;

He \*always\* compared me to his ex. He would constantly wear the promise ring she had given him. When I tried to give him a promise ring, he ""accidentally"" broke it after two days and went back to wearing the one his ex gave him. When he was happy with me, he would tell me how he was glad I was better than his ex. He made a point to go on and on about how stupid, annoying, and fat his ex was. He would tell me extremely sexual and private stories about her. If I did something wrong, he would accuse me of being just like his ex and warn me that if I didn't shape up, he'd leave me just like I left her. He always told me that I'd be someone else's ""sloppy seconds"" after he left me, just like she ended up as ""sloppy seconds"". Not wanting to be anyone's sloppy seconds, yearning for his approval, I did everything I could to be better than this woman who I had never met or spoken to before. 

&amp;#x200B;

This retriggered my jealousy issues. I became obsessed with this ex and AnimeAssassin only supported that. He encouraged me to stalk her social media. He made a point to show me all their old photos together. One time he sat me down and flipped through every single prom photo they took together. I became this hateful, jealous person. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this wasn't really traumatic. I can accept fault in that. I let myself become hateful and jealous. If I wasn't a hateful and jealous person, this manipulation would have had no effect on me. It was my fault. He wouldn't have had had fun with this if I wasn't bad in the first place. The worst, most hurtful thing, what was really traumatic, was how he turned dancing into a way to earn his love.

&amp;#x200B;

AnimeAssassin and I were partners on our university's competitive ballroom dancing team. It's how we met. It started out sweet enough, but he quickly made it awful. He always reminded me how terrible of a dancer I was. Any single mistake was met with huffing, sulking, or even storming out. He constantly asked me why I couldn't be like the other female dancers on the team. He played on my insecurity about my intelligence, telling me that I just wasn't smart enough to be a good dancer. He convinced me I had a mental deficiency that prevented me from understanding rhythm. In retrospect, I don't think I was the weak one in our partnership. But that's beside the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

This constant criticism and comparison got worse and worse. I think he really enjoyed how desperate it made me. During our second competition together, he signed us up for Viennese Waltz (one of the most difficult dances) without telling me. I had only ever done this dance once and \*barely\* remembered the basic foot pattern. I had never done it with a partner before, only in solo practice. But he refused to let us drop out. Five minutes before the round started, he finally caved in to my pleading to let us practice it. He jerked me around and insulted me all through that practice. By the time we got on the floor, I was holding back tears. The music started and I was a mess. He glared at me the whole time and jerked me around so hard it hurt. I could barely keep going without tripping. He was going much faster than the music. Obviously, we did not perform well. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the music ended he stormed off the floor without me. He gave me the silent treatment until I finally begged him hard enough just to talk to me. I apologized, groveled, and pleaded for him to finish out the competition with me. He gave me this disgusted look, like I was worse than trash, and said something to the effect of, ""I think we need to find other partners. I need someone who can compete at my level. You're too slow a learner for me.""

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't end up changing partners, but he found that he could really tear me down by telling me he'd find someone smarter and better than me to dance with. His friend, DancingDick, who was essentially a captain on the team, worked together with AnimeAssassin to destroy me. I was constantly reminded I was too tall and clumsy to be with AnimeAssassin. My eating disorder was the worst it had ever been during that time. I just kept trying to make myself smaller so I could deserve AnimeAssassin. The day of that competition, I hadn't eaten in more than 24 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the summer began, I went out of state for a summer internship. AnimeAssassin stayed in town and continued going to practice with the ballroom team. Every evening he would eagerly tell me about all the amazing girls he got to dance with. He'd tell me how short and perfect they were, how fast they picked up on new moves. He told me he would give a couple of them one on one lessons. Sometimes I wonder if he cheated. I wouldn't be surprised, but I have no evidence. I do know that around that time he was banned from his fraternity for hitting on and sexually harassing female pledges. I didn't find that out until after the relationship ended. But I don't know if it's ok for me to make assumptions when I have no proof.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my jealousy raged. I never, ever lashed out at AnimeAssassin or tried to tell him what he could/couldn't do. But I thought if I voiced my discomfort he'd stop. I would tell him, ""I'm not feeling good about this. Please don't tell me these things"" but he'd just double down. After that summer, I left the ballroom team. I felt I didn't deserve to be on the team. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the last year or so since that relationship ended I haven't given any thought to the effects this particular issue had on me. My jealousy seemed to disappear. I've made friends with many women since then. I don't feel jealous or territorial over my boyfriend. Like I said, I love that he trains other women. I love that he has female friends. I'm still not super comfortable on the topic of exes, but I don't feel obsessive or hateful towards them. Neither of us are very inclined to discuss our exes in detail and I have enough coping skills to avoid going down any jealousy rabbit holes. I'm still quietly working on getting rid of all those hangups over SO's exes, but it's largely under control and not a problem anymore. All in all, I've grown a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I didn't realize that I still had this hang up. I guess I underestimated the damage that had been done. Last night I just assumed and accepted that I'd be hurt and eventually left for someone ""better than me"". I expected my boyfriend to rabidly hate me and punish me for not having the exact correct posture just as I'd expect the sun to rise. I got so fucking scared. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I recognize the source of this, I'm trying to make a healthy plan moving forward. I feel like if I let this turn into something toxic, things will go down a bad road. Whenever this woman is at the gym I'll be obsessing over every perceived perfection of her's and imperfection of mine. I'll let myself become jealous and that could end up hurting my boyfriend. I could see this woman actually ending up as a consistent person here, and if I let this control me I'll give up what could be a good friendship, or at least a friendly acquaintance. If I do all that, it's as if AnimeAssassin is continuing to dictate my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my action plan is to just start slow. I'm going to be friendly to her, try to make conversation, and get to know her. But when I'm actually training, I'm going to pretend she's not there. I need to try to separate her skill from mine. Eventually, I hope I can count her as a friend. I need to try to accept that I can't control my boyfriend's actions but I also can't assume future actions. If he does fall totally in love with her like AnimeAssassin became infatuated with the other female dancers, I guess I'll have to figure out some healthy course of action. But I don't think that would happen. I have no evidence it would. So I'll just act normal. If I find that I can't overcome this and things just get worse mentally, I'll have to make the hard decision to leave the gym. I don't think it will come to that, but I'll be emotionally prepared to just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

I just hate that I have this issue. I hate that I'm still a jealous and insecure person. I wish I could just see another talented, hardworking woman and feel nothing but excitement. I haven't even told my boyfriend I have this issue. I don't want him to know I'm like this. I don't want to admit I'm anything like AnimeAssassin.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really asking for advice or anything. I feel pretty ok with my action plan. I guess I'm sharing this as a warning to others to really evaluate yourself for unhealthy habits you've picked up from your JustNoSO's. Their effects can be insidious and you might not notice them for a while. But make sure you're always aware of your own actions and motivations. "

9qt23q,2,2018-10-23,[D] Having trouble coming up with an appropriate job title.,stillconfuseddddd,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9qt23q/d_having_trouble_coming_up_with_an_appropriate/,"I am a software developer with 2 years experience in the US with a BS in CS. Since my company is small, we all wear many hats, but I mainly develop plugins for B2B desktop applications and may be dealing with plugins for related web apps in the future. Our company would like to add some ML into our mix.

Since I had taken an undergrad AI course, I was the most familiar with the topic, and to gain more familiarity I took a grad-level Machine Learning course, which focused on the theoretical foundations of popular models. Now my boss would like for me to basically be a one-man ML department (with possible interns in the future): coming up with ideas of where to use ML, gathering the required data, selecting implementing and training the models, and then integrating that with our existing tools. I don't expect much research/theoretical stuff, more application of existing techniques to our particular historical data and domain.

Basically, I'm having trouble coming up with a job title that's relevant, but doesn't imply that I'm more educated or experienced than I really am. I may get a masters' someday, but it would be years out. Machine Learning Engineer job listings seem to skew very heavily towards masters and PhDs, or at least people with a ton of experience. Machine Learning Developer seems like it might be a bit better, but I'm not sure. Data Scientist seems to include much more of a statistics background, and a different focus.

Basically, we want an official title for me for client/marketing/business reasons, and I don't want to mislead people. What is appropriate?

Edit: &amp; sorry for the lame post. i realize the details are specific to me but hopefully there are other people in reasonably similar situations or interested in this. i did search for job titles but didn't see anything about people without grad degrees or lots of experience."

I went to the pre-interview social, it went pretty well, had a great time, connected with quite a few staff, blah blah blah.

So please confirm of deny my ""info"" below

It's 2 days and I heard it was essentially dinner one night, next day-breakfast, panel questions(???not sure what this is???), 2 interviews, presentations, and lunch.

I also heard it was mainly behavioral questions, and to bring a bunch of questions. 

So again idk where to even start, I pretty much have my set basic *basic* questions but I've never made it to the second round for a big firm so I'm not sure what or how many I should ask, What questions are out of bounds? 

How many(# or %) people usually get an offer (I heard it differs by office, mine is florida btw, audit internship)?

Also in the RSVP it asks if I have any offers that expire? is that like outstanding offers? Which I do, for smaller firms though, so do I click yes?

Last one I swear, I originally applied for the summer term, but in the RSVP it gives the option ""I'm flexible for either summer or winter terms"", which I am but idk if I had to stick to what I applied to.

I've applied to some different places but never heard back and I haven't seen to many available positions in my area. Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated! "

9qu1js,13,2018-10-23,I don't know how much longer I can go.,imageningtime,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9qu1js/i_dont_know_how_much_longer_i_can_go/,"I’ve just had a really nice meal and I feel like I’ve experienced all there is to life. I’m writing this because my suicidal thoughts are spiraling out of control and I want to know if there is anybody I that I could relate. I want to make this post as short as possible but please bear in mind that I’m feeling the need to let it all out in case this ends up being my last piece of writing. I’ll just say that I’m a third-year student in the college of engineering at Ohio State University. If this post comes across one of my roommates, by any chance, I would ask them to please delete everything on my computer and destroy the hard drive.

I’ve ruined many relationships due to my selfish lack of involvement. My grades are suffering, and I didn’t even apply for a single internship because somehow, god knows why, I couldn’t find the motivation and courage to do so. I’ve lost all my interest in clubs and activities I used to enjoy. I don’t even enjoy playing games on my pc anymore. My stress level keeps skyrocketing every time something bad happens, and I started to not care anymore. I feel like a total failure.

I developed depersonalization in the past couple weeks. The world doesn’t feel real anymore. My memories, my friends, and even myself feel like strangers. I just feel numb and detached. I’m living in a constant brain fog and everything seems like a haze now. Life feels like a movie that you know has a sad ending, but you watch it anyway.

I had a dream about suicide a couple days ago and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Last time I thought about suicide was when I was much younger, half-asleep in a car being driven to school, and thinking how nice it would be if I jumped out of the door and got hit by a truck. That thought left me scared for days and I thought I’d never get into that situation in my life, but here I am, depressed.

Do I want someone to reach out to me? I don’t know. Help leads to life, and the thought of living brings me an eerie sense of unfamiliarity and discomfort. There is a child-like part of me that cries in pure agony, screaming for help, a friend, or anybody that can just hug me, let all my emotions out, and tell me that it’s going to be ok. There is another, more realistic part of me that looks at my past, present, and all the possibilities in my future and tells me that no, you were always a failure and always will be, you’re never going to find happiness, and hands me this forbidden fruit, nature’s greatest anesthesia, the all-healing act that will remove all of my suffering and worries for eternity.

Realizing that I have almost lost all control of my spiraling thoughts and emotions, and that the upcoming midterms could very well be my last straw, I figured that it is necessary for me to make sense of all of this and put it into words. In all honesty, I don’t know who I am anymore. I don’t even know what I want the outcome of this post to be, but there is a voice inside my head telling me that I must absolutely do this and let someone see it.

I hope that whoever reads this to not be affected by my negativity in any way, and that you would have a wonderful day.

Thank you."

I'm looking at the Surface Go to be reliable for travel, class, and business work (taking to internships). Hopefully able to last about 5 hours before needing a charge, I was hoping to get 3 hours out of my MSI before charging, but it barely lasts an hour after 4 years of owning it and its just not feasible to have to stay charged throughout my classes. 

I don't need it to do data analysis or music production but it's a plus if it has utilities to reliably support my soon to be home workstation with my MSI. Something I've been hoping to pick up a bit more is drawing, how do the Surface Go models compare on this front? I'm looking for it to be easy to open and use, without having to worry about setting a ton of stuff up like I do currently with my laptop.

I've spent hours on different reviews of the Go lineup, but its been a little difficult to find comparisons of the different Gos for specifically my needs. Really hoping someone can chime in with some experience after getting to use the device for a while.

TL;DR: I have a gaming laptop for music production and at home work. Can a Surface Go support these hobbies in any way? Does the device stay reliable for \~6 hours, and how is the drawing on it? Which model would you recommend as a secondary device for on the go, hopefully able to last 3-4 years. I am a student and on a budget, but want to stay realistic as to what the cheaper vs expensive Go will do for me."

I’ll have my bachelors following the spring semester and my masters by fall of next year. 

I have been in college a while, literally transferring between three different schools (one I went to twice). This (and the need for my full time job) resulted in me never finding an internship nor gaining any outside accounting experience. Thus, these last couple years at my final school I have been engaging in so many on-campus student activities in order to beef up my resume. 

My current school had a “meet the firms” event in late August where I got to speak to some representatives from local firms and some from
the Big Four. What worries me is that I have had no response from any firms I engaged with (subsequently applied to) and I have had no responses whatsoever from jobs I applied to through my schools website. I unfortunately don’t have access to my resume while posting this but I do have a 3.5 accounting GPA and I am
involved I’m some leadership positions on campus.

My questions include, does anyone have any advice on what my next step should be? I am
interested in internships at a Big Four firm but are internships pointless for me at this point? 

TLDR: I need some advice on how I should go about getting a job after school lol. "

I am in my late forties and looking to change careers. I have always had a love of skincare and nutrition and have wanted to combine those two passions in order to help others. Many years ago, I attended Esthetician School and completed a 600 hour program. This was before my state required estheticians to be licensed and the school did not provide training in waxing or other hair removal, which was ideal for me, since I prefer the facials and skin health aspects of the field. After graduating, I worked briefly at a holistic day spa. However, my lack of training, skills and confidence in performing extractions and other procedures caused me to quit within a short time. 

Approaching age 50, I want to obtain a degree or license in a field which would enable me to have a stable and rewarding career. I have worked my entire professional life in customer service and have developed solid communication and people skills while still maintaining my passion for skincare, nutrition, and helping others. I have narrowed down my choices to: Esthetician, Dietetics Technician or Pharmacy Technician. Here are the pros and cons of each path:

Esthetician:       Pros:  -I have previous education in the field.

\-I have limited experience working in a day spa and a lot of experience working in a retail   
cosmetics/beauty department

\-I have a passion for helping others improve their skin, health and lives and love learning about   
new advances in skincare and how lifestyle factors can affect the quality of your skin.

\-It appears to be a stable and profitable career in which I can utilize my strong customer service 

experience and natural creativity.

Cons: -Esthetics School is expensive and the ones near me offer little to no tuition assistance

\- I am uncertain if I would be able to master the waxing and extraction techniques

\- The potential for salary increases seem to be limited and based upon the type of clientele, the   
season,  and the results of my own marketing and networking.

Dietetic Tech:      Pros:  - Appears to be a stable career 

\- I have a passion for helping others improve their lives by improving their diet and lifestyle   
and love learning about new discoveries in health and nutrition.  

\-I could continue my education and become a dietitian.

Cons: -Although it appears to be a stable career, the opportunities for dietetic technicians are extremely   
limited. Most companies seem to only hire dietary aides at minimum wage and then train them   
on the job.

\-If I decide to become a dietitian, I would need more education (master's degree will soon be a   
requirement for dietitians) and complete an internship which is extremely tough and competitive   
and I do not really have the time or means for all of that schooling.



Pharmacy Tech:  Pros:  -Appears to be a stable career with a good future job outlook and growth

\- There are lots of job opportunities and options for the field in my area

\- Room for advancement and growth in salary

\-Short schooling, only 2-3 months

\-Many companies provide on the job training while becoming certified

\- I currently work at a retailer which has a pharmacy, so it would be a smooth transition with a lot   
of company support.

\-Although I am very creative, I also am very thorough and precise with a great attention to detail

\- I enjoy customer service and helping people

Cons: -Most pharmacy techs do not seem to enjoy their jobs.

\-High stress level of the job

\- I am horrible at math

\- I do not like the pharmaceutical/drug industry. I prefer and have always used and advocated a   
whole and natural approach to improving health

Which path would be the best? Could I combine any of the two or all  three educations into a career? I realize that it is ultimately my decision, but I really would like to hear any and all advice, thoughts, feedback and perspectives. Any and all advice and feedback is greatly appreciated!

Cameramen checked and double checked their equipment while writers poured over notes. The whole studio was in a state of organized chaos where things were getting done but, no one knew really how yet.

The producer burst into the room, taking a cup of coffee from an intern before sending several others away to make copies. As he crossed to his chair far behind the cameras, he took a sidelong glance at you; the young, attractive, new weather girl who was sitting on a bar stool in front of the green screen for the first time. No one else knew how you had talked your way into getting a shot like this, but the producer shot you a smug grin before sitting down.

There was an agreement. Not official, just between you and him. It was for 'entertainment value' and 'to test your nerves' and of course the old 'all the big names have done it at least once!'.

""In order to get this chance to forge a path for your career, you...Get this...And I'm sure you know where it goes"" he said, not 30 minutes ago in a dark conference room. He was holding up a small pink oval, smooth to the touch and about the size of a golf ball. Then he held up a remote control, switched it on, and held the ball as it buzzed to life in his fingers.

""You have 10 minutes to decide."" He shoved the little vibrator into your hand and walked out, not looking back.

And here you were, ready to show your face to the world and prove that you had what it takes to get up in front of several cameras and try to make the weather interesting to viewers.

""We're on in five! Four! Three!...""

9qun76,1,2018-10-23,Applying for jobs with BPD – looking for advice!,rd719,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/9qun76/applying_for_jobs_with_bpd_looking_for_advice/,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post but I’m panicking a little and not sure what to do.

CN: work, suicidal thoughts, leaving a job, bad reference

I was recently interning at a company and was diagnosed with BPD while I was there. I’d had to have a few days off before the diagnosis because I was extremely suicidal. I ended up being signed off for 3 weeks by my doctor while I saw my local crisis team daily, was prescribed new meds and finally got a BPD diagnosis. This was obviously difficult to deal with, and while I did go back to work after the 3 weeks off I struggled and subsequently had to take more time off. I ended up handing in my notice – the internship was due to finish 6 weeks later anyway – as I wanted to take a little pressure off myself and also didn’t feel it was fair on the company if I kept missing work, even though I had a note from the doctor.

Fast forward a few weeks and I was feeling a lot better, more stable, and coming to terms with the diagnosis. I applied for a new job and was offered the role after a successful interview. During the interview I didn’t disclose that I had finished my internship earlier than intended as I didn’t want to get into my mental health issues, but I did tell her I had finished working there. 

The day I was supposed to start, I got a phone call from the new job saying they had spoken to my old work and found out that I had finished early. She wanted to give me a chance to explain “my side of the story”, so I explained I had been ill and felt it was the right thing to do at the time to give myself a chance to get better, without going into details. She asked for more references, which I provided. 

Today she rescinded the job offer. I contacted my old employer who told me they would always praise my work in a reference, but if asked would mention that I had absences and finished the internship early. I am obviously so disappointed, but also now super worried about the future. I have another interview tomorrow – do I have to disclose then about my medical history and absences from work? I feel like this is gonna put me in a bad position but I don’t want this one experience to stop me working again. 

Sorry if this is super long, I’m just so stressed and panicky and don’t really know what to do! 

TL;DR: Had to quit old job because of BPD, have already had one job offer rescinded because of this and worried it’s going to happen again. "

9quwfs,4,2018-10-23,I don't know if what happened to me was sexual assault and I don't want to be dramatic or invalidate worse things that have happened to other people (TW - explicit details of what happened),anon22559,rapecounseling,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/9quwfs/i_dont_know_if_what_happened_to_me_was_sexual/,"I just want to start out by saying that I know what a lot of people on this subreddit have been through is worse than what I've been through and I'm not trying to say that it's the same thing.

Backstory:

About three and a half years ago I started the job that I'm currently at.  I started in June and during the summer I met a coworker on a different team at a company party.  We were at a lake and I had put on a bathing suit thinking about going in the water.  ""Coworker"" had been flirting with me and trying to convince me to go in the water.  I was climbing down the ladder on the deck into the water, but it was really cold, so I changed my mind.  He tried to push me into the water with his body by climbing down the ladder himself.  I managed to stay out of the water by swinging to the side bruising my knee on the ladder, but I was really pissed off at Coworker.  I decided that he was bad news and that I should stay away from him.  But at the end of the summer, all of my friends went home because they were interns and I was full time and I got really lonely.  I ate lunch with his team sometimes because one of the guys on his team had the same grad school advisor that I did and worked in the same lab at my college (which is how I met Coworker in the first place).  Coworker emailed me and asked me for my number, but when I didn't respond, he got it from my lab-mate.

One day at lunch I was talking about wanting to learn to play tennis and it turned out that Coworker was a serious tennis player and offered to teach me.  I decided to take him up on the offer: he and I played for a while and then got lunch.  It was fun.  I don't remember exactly how things progressed, but we hung out more, I he introduced me to his cats, and one night he ended up staying over at my place and we kissed.  At that point I'd say we started ""dating"" and I was into it.  Looking back I can't help thinking ""stupid, stupid, stupid me.""

The parts I didn't like:

There were a few things that happened during our relationship that ended up really bothering me.  These two are the ones that I'm not sure what to ""call them"".

Instance #1: We had been dating about a week and were at his place watching TV under a blanket. It was the first time I'd had my shirt (and bra) off around him. I went into the bathroom to take off my earrings because they were hurting while we were cuddling and after a bit he followed me into the bathroom. He was standing behind me and the way he was looking at me in the mirror made me feel uncomfortable so I quickly took off the earrings and then turned to leave. He grabbed my wrists and held them. I gave a light pull and he didn't let go, so I gave a more firm pull - he still didn't let go. I panicked and started struggling as hard as I could to leave right after that second pull, but he still didn't let go and I thought he was going to rape me.  I struggled for about 5 seconds before I went into begging mode ""Please let me go"" and he did. I was in fight or flight mode so I ran out of the bathroom.  We never discussed it at all and in retrospect I'm surprised he didn't ask why I literally ran away out of the bathroom.   I also feel really stupid for not breaking up with him after this.

Instance #2: We had been dating for about 2 weeks. We'd had protected (consensual - he asked ""Should I get a condom?"" and I said ""yes"" before we had sex) sex once and this time we were in bed together, making out, not wearing anything. We hadn't had a discussion about protection or having sex on this night, but I was enjoying making out with him and was responding positively. Then he put his penis in me without a condom on. I wasn't expecting him to do that.  I thought he'd ask me or ask to get a condom before putting his penis in me. I yelled, ""Hey, you aren't wearing a condom!"" and jumped away from him as soon as I realized what he was doing, but it was too late to protect myself from being exposed to any STDs he might have had. He seemed surprised and said, ""Wow, you jumped really far"".  We talked about it afterword and I told him how much it bothered me and how he had to ask first.  He ended up agreeing and apologizing.  I was worried about STDs and he told me that he'd had unprotected sex with two girls since he'd last been tested.  One was a while before that night and one was about a month before.  He got tested right away and everything was negative, but since HIV takes 3 months to show up on a test, I had to wait to know if he had it.  He told me he'd get tested again two months down the road.  For the next two months I spent a lot of my free time reading about HIV (anxiety is an issue for me) and not eating enough.

After-story:

He ended up braking up with me after 5 weeks.  The first words out of my mouth after he did were, ""I still want you to get tested, though,"" and he said that he would.  I was lonely enough that the next day I asked him to reconsider, and he said no.  We played tennis once or twice after that, but slowly it started to sink in how much I really disliked him and I stopped saying hi to him in the cafeteria and making eye contact with him in the halls.

I tried text chatting with rainn to ask them if what occurred was sexual assault but they would only ask me if I felt like a victim.  Luckily the next guy I dated asked for verbal consent for everything and was super careful, because I didn't realize until I was in bed with him how scared of it I was.

I've had dumb moments at work like one where I just completely stopped talking mid-sentence during a conversation with my boss because I saw a notification pop up that Coworker had emailed my boss. About six months ago, I was playing foosball in the hallway at work when Coworker and another coworker walked behind me down the hall.  I panicked a bit and ended up having a nightmare about being grabbed, so I watched a bunch of videos online about how to get out of a double wrist grab from behind.  I'd taken some aikido, so it was something I'd done before (although when Coworker grabbed my wrists I was too panicked to put it to use).  I convinced my boyfriend to grab my wrists to help me practice it and I was comforted by being able to break his grip even when he was really trying to hold on.

I just really wish I knew how to ""label"" what happened between me and Coworker.  Not knowing what to call it for some reason makes me feel like I have this unanswered question and I wish I could get some closure.  Does anyone here know?

I know this was a really long post, and I really appreciate everyone who read it or scanned through it."
9qv466,3,2018-10-23,Should I pursue a career in Ad Ops?,cryptboot,adops,https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/9qv466/should_i_pursue_a_career_in_ad_ops/,"I’m currently 18 years old and I have started my first year in a college studying Advertising.

An internship is a mandatory part of the program, so by the time I graduate I will have at least two placements in ad agencies that I can hopefully get employed at. Also I love advertising and selling things online.

Throughout my high-school days (last year) I ran an e-commerce store that sold phone cases through Instagram &amp; Facebook. I spent roughly $4,000 of my own money on Facebook ads and learned retargeting &amp; lookalike audiences. In the meantime I worked with large influencers on Instagram in my niche and spent about $7,000 of my money buying shoutouts on their pages. I ended up making $36,000.

I would say that I have strong hands on experience with branding on Instagram, creating ""hype"" with good influencers, as well as with Facebook:

* managing campaigns
* split-testing creatives for best CTR, CPM, etc.
* retargeting, lookalike audiences
* using the pixel for targeting website visitors

Based on the skills and the details I've given on myself above, I have a couple questions:

* Do you think Ad Ops is right for me?
* What platforms should I learn to be ready for the industry when I graduate in 2020?
* Is there a demand for people who are skilled in paid social?
* What should I do today to get in the industry?

The reasons for the long distance is that she is from another country, she is studying and I am in the army. The plan is to start closing the distance next year when I am getting out of the army and she is graduating.


This is also my first relationship and I am trying to learn how these things work. Mainly by reading this subreddit, books and forums.


In the beginning we had some bumps due to my inexperience, clingy behaviour, hollywoodish image of romance and establishing good communications.


She has been having a very tough time recently from doing an internship in another country, losing a relative right at the end of the internship, losing a good friend due to said friend's own issues and continuing studies again which are hard.


Lately she has been feeling that I do not know her. This was a big issue after I sent her a care package with my shirt, ""open when..."" letters and a necklace (something from my culture to her to have me near her in the internship). She didn't like the necklace and she was devastated by it. She said that it's not her style. Soon after she broke up with me shortly saying ""You don't know me even after all this time"". True, we were together for over half a year at that point but had only seen each other for 3 days when I travelled to see her before my army time started.
So I responded by voicing my opinion that since we are not physically together and we only were together for 3 days, it's hard for me to notice these things.


Two weeks later she said that she consulted he friend and apologized. We got back together.


Now after losing her relative and startibg school again, things have become rocky. We agreed to start things slow (I am a bit shaken by the things she said when we broke up earlier (such as not knowing how to flirt, not finding me handsome but being attracted by my heart and personality, me not knowing how to make things happen with women and her being tired of being my teacher)), take time to know each other and be more open.


Her birthday is coming up and I am trying to find something nice for her. We talked about the love languages and did the test. Her's was services and gifts. Mine was words and physical stuff.
Yesterday she sent me a picture of her looking online for jewelery. I asked what kind of stuff she found interesting (As per the promise and curiosity of getting to know her). She denied showing me those saying ""I don't trust you to get me the right thing. Because you don't know me. Even though we have been together for 10 months.""


This made me worry more and I don't want to fuck up.
My current idea is to try to find a gift that is something in her love language - service or a gift. And I am a bit lost as to what kind of service I can give while being long distance. And she says that she doesn't want a gift gift from me because I don't know her enough to get her what she likes.

This is my first relationship and I am just feeling lost.


So I am actually asking for advice on three things:
1) How to overcome my anxities and fears about the things she said when we broke up?

2) How can I improve myself to be a better boyfriend for her?

3) Any gift ideas? :D

**tl;dr: How to overcome anxities in a relationship and be a better boyfriend for someone you love?**"

9qyihb,6,2018-10-24,I [28F] dragged my bf [26M] into living together without realizing how messed up I am.,clanofthethrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9qyihb/i_28f_dragged_my_bf_26m_into_living_together/,"We've been dating two years. Met at Whole Foods back when we were broke and not in a position to take life seriously anyway. I only ever heard a string of FWB behind me because I liked the ability to regulate the relationship, and was always able to cut it off amiably before anyone got too butthurt, usually around the 6 month mark. He was a serial monogamist. He's a Disney princess, get-married-out-of-high-school-and-get-buried-in-the-same-grave-plot type. Never had a relationship longer than two years.  

Where we are is my fault. I got into this relationship because I liked him, I knew he was a good man who wouldn't turn around and ruin my life if we broke up, and I figured it was time to give this relationship thing a shot. It was rocky,  but solid.  We're such different people. I like to come home and sit quietly; he gets anxious if he's not having a conversation with someone basically 24/7. He's a monogamist; I'm not, but I have morals so I'd never cheat. He grew up in the hood, didn't really read much, and his education was spotty; I was an honor roll student my whole life,  always made dean's list, graduated cum laude. How different we are  was more and more apparent every day,  with near misses in conversation, us hitting the other's nerves when it comes to a topic we're sensitive about, but we got along, we planned for the future, we have the same interests, we were solid. 

Flash forward to now.  Before July,  I lived with roommates at the time,  and he lived at home with his mom. Eveything went sour witb the roommates (nothing to do with me) and his mother was controlling a lot of his life (she held his insurance and would only buy him meds when she felt like spending the money,  she handled most of his documents and was to blame when stuff went missing,  she stopped buying enough food for both of them, just herself, because she was mad he was spending all his time with me and not feeding her codependency) so next stage was moving in together. And now we're here,  cozy one bedroom, great location. And I'm miserable. And I'm making him miserable. Because I was stupid enough to see every red flag that I shouldn't have done this and I ignored it. Fucking stupid. 

See, while we weren't living together, he went back for his Master's, and quickly realized he was in over his head. Why? His father was helping him write his papers. To the point of writing half of them. And they were awful,  and I'm an English major. So I edited them. During the first year of his Master's, I spend hours on this, and hours of fighting with him about this. It's only after we moved in together and I took a HUGE step back from that, only helped him by helping him comprehend the assignment and align his thoughts, and checking purely for grammar (which I make him fix,  and I won't look at it until he proofreads it anymore) that he had finally begrudgingly admitted what a huge crutch he's been leaning on.  

That's just one example of how I've been lesding him through life,  and just one physical example,  nooooooot even counting the times I've had to lead him through his self doubt,  depression,  what have you. I guess the point of this rant is... I'm tired of him. I know the girl that's still fascinated by him and cares deeply for  him and wants him to succeed and be there is still in there somewhere... but I just don't. I don't feel anything when I look at him anymore. Our sex life is pathetic because his approach to foreplay is clumsy and cursory at best,  and I don't feel enough for him to want to take charge and get it anyway. I'm starving, but I'm just not hungry. I'm tired all the time, he's not working any meaningful hours because his field has a mandatory internship that takes up all his time,  and I'm new to my career and can't really move from this mediocrely paying job right now. It's not a stressful job or anything. I'm just emotionally tired. 

I'm not the woman I was before. I loved to party. I saw friends often. I kept up on current events, I kept up with people, I went to meetup groups fior ny career,  but I'm scared to do that now. He's been trying his hardest to hold down the fort, does all the domestic work in the hoise because he's usually home studying, and when he has a little cash he throws it towards house things. I would like to do more things witb him,  but I can't float him all the time,  and I'm afraid that if I go out all the time and be who I used to be,  I'll divorce myself entirely from him,  kwim? He'll always just be waiting for me to come home,  and I'll never come home. He doesn't get that. 

We've talked about how hard it's been. He'll never say he's unhappy. I always have the grievances,  he's willing to pack down anything of I'm still there. He doesn't believe that people can break up for just general incompatibility ( Bennett happened to him,  probably wouldn't know it if he saw it), only if you cheat on him or go down a junkie path or something.  If there's anything we can't resolve, he'd just prefer not to talk about it. But I see it in his eyes. He's sad. He's tired. He's touch-starved. And I feel horrible.  But he's always ""fine"". Always ""happy"". Bullshit.

I made an appointment for therapy. Just for me,  hopefully to evolve into therapy for both of us. I don't even think he thinks we need therapy,  he's just going along with it because I insisted. I don't know what to do with the bed I've made. I don't know how long I can do this. It's only been three months. I don't know what advice there is to give,  but if you have any,  I'd appreciate it. 

TLDR: Moved in with boyfriend, regretting idea because it's hurting both of us, feeling trapped, BF feels it too but would never admit it. It's my fault,  don't know how to live with it."
9qyrsn,7,2018-10-24,Trying to update the value of a variable when user clicks on a switch but the switch won't change.,AdigeWottah,reactnative,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/comments/9qyrsn/trying_to_update_the_value_of_a_variable_when/,"I developed various apps on Android Studio for Android and am trying to adapt to RN since last week. I'm not very good at JS either as I have just recently started learning it AFTER being employed as a RN developer intern. Yet, I've been given the task of developing an already existing RN application right away. Anyway, here's my problem:

We have a list of properties that we get from the server-side. I'm trying to implement a switch per property, allowing the user to either hide it or display it. propertyFlag is the variable that decides whether the switch is on or off, and the switch should also change the value of the variable when switched.
I coded the switch below:

                            &lt;Switch
                                onTintColor={""#eee""}
                                thumbTintColor={property.propertyFlag ? Colors.ACCENT : ""#eee""}
                                onValueChange = {(value) =&gt; property.propertyFlag = !value}
                                value = {property.propertyFlag}
                            &gt;&lt;/Switch&gt;}

The initial status of the switch is correct according to the value that's coming from the server, the database. However, when I click the switch, nothing happens. What am I doing wrong? Once I get things right locally, I'll be sending the properties back to the server to be saved onto the database.

Here's the whole code if it helps:

        import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';

I don't know what most of the code does either. All I want to do is to change the value of the property flags and send the properties back to the server. If you can recommend some good sources to learn RN it'd be more than welcome."
9qyz1j,13,2018-10-24,LPT: Don’t pick the university with cheaper tuition. Research and analyze your options.,lolephant88,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/9qyz1j/lpt_dont_pick_the_university_with_cheaper_tuition/,"I’m writing this because I saw the other popular LPT that the rest of reddit has been parroting since forever. There’s this widespread push for choosing a school based on what gives you the least amount of debt, but it really doesn’t take everything into account.

First off, a lot of people were making fun of students from top tier universities with lots of debt, and it bothered me so much that I have to address it. If we’re talking about elite universities, Ivy league schools don’t require tuition if your family income is below 60k, and most only require a small percentage of your family income if you’re middle class. Stanford has a very similar program, with tuition being covered if your family income is under 125k. If you come from a high socioeconomic background, you can probably afford these schools anyways. To sum up everything, if you have what it takes to get in, you should definitely apply for these schools. 

Now onto my arguments for lower ranked, top 25ish private universities. Some of the arguments were addressed in the comments already, but to consolidate those reasons of why a more expensive school would be better, one should consider alumni network, resources, and the environment. The differences in networks between a state university and a high ranking private university can make a huge impact on your future. While I did dual enrollment in highschool at a local state university, basically nobody helped, and I was on my own. When I went off to my private university for freshman year, I was shocked that alumni would go so far out of their way to help students academically and career-wise. I got my first dream internship solely from pledging a fraternity and being approached by alumni.

Additionally, one should look up whether their school is a target/semi-target school. On campus recruiting is almost required to get jobs in investment banking, consulting, or other high finance careers. Some people were saying that school doesn’t matter after your first few jobs, but these areas are almost impossible to break into outside of going back for your masters at an elite university. While extremely important for business careers, it can be seen a little bit in tech as well; Google and Facebook hire an overwhelming portion of their employees from the top 10 universities. For example, look at John Legend. I’m certain he is very intelligent, but he also got into management consulting at a top firm with a degree in English. I would bet my left nut that him going to UPenn and taking part in a couple honor societies there were big factors in his employment. One should research what companies offer good compensation (salary, interest, and work life) for their desired field, and see where those companies recruit heavily from. 

Additionally, consider the people you’re going to be around at college and how they will affect you. Student organizations can be important aspects of a resume, they can give you a glimpse of what work will be like in the future, and they can provide excellent networking opportunities. The student orgs that are doing crazy innovative or impactful work are mostly at top universities. Most of it’s because they have the prestige and resources to do so, but it can also be attributed to how motivated, talented, and well connected the other students are. The people around you have an influence over your own motivation and choices. 

Another thing to consider is salary after college, and if that would allow for one to take out private loans. For example, I will have about 60k in debt after getting my undergraduate degree, but I also know I’m going to get a much higher salary with drastic increases every two years. If I had gone to a state school, I definitely wouldn’t have the same salary progression or ceiling. I may have debt coming out of uni, but I will have also paid if off in 2 years of working. 

Basically, do your research before you make a decision. Look at your potential exit opportunities, salaries, and financial aid package. You may have to take on debt, but that isn’t always necessarily a bad thing. Also be realistic with yourself. If only 4 people are hired by a competitive industry per year at a school you’re looking at, don’t put yourself in debt for that small opportunity. Gauge your own ability as well. Look at others, stalk people on linkedin, study up on school subreddits/ratemyprofessor and see what it takes to get to where you want. From my experience and others’, you might be the big fish now in highschool, but you’re moving from a small pond into the ocean. An acquaintance from high school thought he was special and could totally ace organic chem because he was ranked in the top 3 at our school. Last time I checked, he was no longer premed. You also might not be cut out for super intensive jobs. I know for a fact that I can’t work 80+ hours a week in investment banking, so I didn’t have to worry about going to a target school for that. If you’re somewhat self aware and do your research, you’ll likely come to the right decision. 

Edit*: Transferring can work to your advantage for quite a few careers, but again, it doesn't work for every case. Just from what I know, in finance careers, and to an extent, big 4 accounting, the firms want to see that you've been attending the school from the beginning, and only really care about your gpa from the school you've transferred to. You're much better off starting at the better school starting freshman year. I've also seen people go into what I call ""limbo"" because they've stalled from being around unmotivated people at community college. Again, do your research, be self aware, and you'll make the appropriate decision.

Sorry that this was super long, but I had a lot to say about the topic.

Tldr: Don’t just choose which college you’re going to based on finances. Research extensively before making a decision because there are multiple factors behind your future employment."
9qz01m,1,2018-10-24,An Unexpected Closure,poor_icarus,u_poor_icarus,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_poor_icarus/comments/9qz01m/an_unexpected_closure/,"I still remember the day I got transferred departments, a few months ago. Yus told me to clear the table and pack my things and follow the people waiting for me outside all the way to the corporate building. 

Omar and Helmi had told me to sit ""in peace"" at their tables moments before, but of course, an order was an order. I waved Helmi goodbye as I walked out of CMK one last time. He had been good to me. And I never saw him again after that day. 

I waited for the longest time in the corporate building. I remember sitting by the window, watching cars looking small like toys from up above. I talked to Medo on the phone, he comforted me, saying it'll all work out. 

Then, before the day ended, I was walked to QC. I was passed from one person to another. I remember the wind as we stepped outside again, how it blew and blew, and how the guy walking me turned back and said I was lucky to be given a second chance and not be terminated. The path to QC was easy to remember, unlike the path to K-shop. 

The first time I stepped into the QC office, I distinctly remember Kak Ja, Azin, Zul and Zam. 

The first time I sat at the table, I talked with Zul and Azin, and they made me feel so welcomed I could cry. Azin had longer hair at the time. He left after briefing me, and Syahrul joined the conversation. I sat at the oval table timidly, wondering and wondering about what was to come. 

Zam was nice, but I don't remember much of him. He helped show me the ropes, just like Omar did. When Zam left, I felt somewhat sad, but I thought to myself I had to do this. Then came along Yon and Izz, and they helped me feel better, but now they are gone too. 

Everyone's gone, huh? 

Soon, I'll be too. 

I remember looking out the window of the QC office, during the early days, seeing the endless sky through the slightly tinted glass, and the painted clouds, I asked myself if I'll see the end of this internship, or if I'll act recklessly again and fail myself. 

The other interns in our housing unit and a few people in K-shop asked regarding my transfer, who requested it, why, and if I was feeling better in QC... so many questions but I had only one answer -- I will just try to survive this. 

The first two months were rough. I almost wanted to die or quit. But Zul and Azin never stopped trying to correct me, never sighed, never scolded. There were countless things I did wrong. Such as going to lunch early and coming back late. Or wearing my own pants. And taking sudden days off. 

Still, there wasn't just a room to grow, but instead a hall. 

I know I sound like a pretentious bullshit, look at me trying to claim I improved while I'm still terrible, but if there's one way to prove that I did learn at least one thing, is by telling you I don't dread coming to and being at work anymore. 

Have you ever been to the beach and found a piece of sea glass? 

A sea glass was once a sharp shard of a broken glassware, and after years and years of tumbling in the ocean, they will become smooth. That is me in QC. I am a piece of sea glass. 

All this time, I never knew about what happened in the background of my transfer to QC, and after several weeks, it was a question I forgot. 

Well, today has been a fateful day.

I came to work as usual and I noticed Mr. Fahmi. He's kinda a big deal, especially in CMK, everyone knows him. 

Back then, at CMK, I came across him once or twice after he returned from Japan, and I think we have smiled at each other passingly. He always struck me as a distinctive person, there was something about his tall posture and mannerisms. After I left CMK, I rarely saw him, but he was present several times during our morning exercise at QC and I never thought much of him. 

Today was... different. 

After the morning exercise, he motioned me to follow him, and I froze for a few seconds. I was having an anxiety attack and thinking of the worst. I responded by making a gesture with my hand, asking if he was really pointing at me, then someone chipped in by saying, ""Boss nak jumpa."" So I followed him. 

We talked in the QC office, it was a very concentrated conversation so I couldn't remember everything, but I wrote some of it down in my pocket diary, so here is the reformulated version. 

He opened by saying that asking me how much time I had left and remarked how he never got to talk to me before the transfer. He asked me if I knew who arranged my transfer to QC. I said I didn't. 

He did, he said.

 He was the one who called QC and Hata and Azin and maybe Zul too agreed. 

I was surprised to know this, because before I thought I was simply like a refunded product as I had defects. But no, instead, it was truly a second chance. Fahmi said this was dealing with humans, so it shouldn't be taken lightly. 

Then we discussed the reasons behind the transfer, which is clearly established to almost everyone, but it was still something to talk about, I think, as a formality, and to acknowledge. I told him I feel a better fit in QC and the work I do here is more my speed. 

There was something interesting he made me do, which was to observe the office in motion, while we were behind the glass window of the room inside the office, and he touched on the topic of work ethics and dreams and ambitions.

As I observed with Fahmi all the people working and interacting with one another, I felt strange. I was not used to seeing people through an analytical lens -- without any personal thoughts and connections. 
  
Everyone has big dreams, no matter the title, Fahmi said. If it's not for them, it's for their family. Everyone deserves to be respected because everyone has potential, he added. Everyone has talent. And to uncover this talent, it's important to explore one's self. 

If I'm interpreting what he was saying correctly, then it was a very humbling thing to say.

Before he left, after shaking my hand, I think he wished me good luck, but I don't quite remember, still, I said thank you to him for taking the time to talk to me. And I meant it. 

Really, I feel like now when I leave this company, I'll go in peace.

 One day, if I stay in Malaysia, which I most probably will, and when I finish my degree, I would love to apply to work again in QC, when I'm older, when I'm wiser. And if so, I would give my all. 

I know it's hard to secure employment here, but there's no harm in trying. But if life, or God, has other plans for me, then I won't object...

I wonder, if God blesses me and I do get to come back, will there still be everyone I loved here?"
9qzovl,2,2018-10-24,Best option if you don't get matched?,ssX_liz,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/9qzovl/best_option_if_you_dont_get_matched/,"I am about to go through DICAS this December. I have a decent work and volunteering history, and good grades. I may be weak in the reference area tho. With more research I have discovered that the overall chance for getting matched at all is only 50%. With that chance so high I'm curious the best way to spend time till the next matching process.
Right now I'm thinking either just working, or possibly going to grad school for Nutrition without the internship? 
Any advice or personal experience would be helpful! "

So I decided to study for IT-Supporter. But as soon as I met my fellow students, I was aware some of them knew almost everything they had to... Now I got this internship (only one in my class so far), and I am having a lot of trouble with self-doubting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually I research a problem and figure out the solution. But I am not 100% knowledgable of every program and system. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is really: how hard is a workplace with people who do not know a bunch of stuff already? I most certainly will have to google some stuff here and there to fix a problem, but I am afraid they think I know most stuff already?

Am I just overthinking things, and maybe they expect me to learn stuff through experience?"

I started as an intern and was offered a job at the end of it. I feel like I've mad a terrible mistake by taking the job. 

I am fresh out of college and have no actual experience other than my short internship. I have gotten little to no guidance/mentorship/direction with this job. They just sorta expect me to know what to do? I've reached out and asked about expectations/what I should be doing but get no real answer. 

Now I'm finding things that are past due and neglected by past people in my job. Fines and dues that are about to be taken to collections, etc. I feel like I'm going to miss something and get in trouble. I feel like I'm drowning all the time. 

The only reason I took the job is because it's good money. Now I'm really regretting it. I basically have to stay 2 years (they paid relocation for me so if I leave earlier I have to pay them a bunch of money back). I hate it. I dread going to work. I live for the weekends. Then half way through Sunday I get anxious about having to work the next day. 😞

I just hate this so much. I don't know what to do from here. I also happen to have no friends other than my boyfriend. I can only vent to him so much before it's just annoying and sad. I don't have any friends to talk to. I'm just alone and frustrated and stressed. "

I have good ECs including research, Vp of red cross club, shadowing director of preDO club and more. I also have a year of research, but no publications. I had a public health related internship with my uni’s med school. I’ve been working as a scribe for 1.5 years now with promotion to trainer. "
9r0wvr,0,2018-10-24,Long term bf (32) may be moving and leaving me (31f) behind,cup17,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9r0wvr/long_term_bf_32_may_be_moving_and_leaving_me_31f/,"My boyfriend was offered a summer internship out of state with the possibility of being offered a job with the company. I told him before he left that I was not going to move away because I am close with my family and I don't want to live anywhere else. I guess I didn't really think about the seriousness of my statement at the time. Maybe I just had high hopes that he wouldn't want to move either after his summer there. Then at one point I told him I'd only move if we got married. Turns out ultimatums don't go great, who knew? He's now been offered a job with the company and is currently working for them from our home state until next summer as he is finishing his degree and that's when he will graduate. Because of what I said before, he said he doesn't think it would be a good idea for me to go with him, even though I've told him I've changed my mind. I explained to him it would be more painful to be without him than my family. We've been together for about 9 years, I don't want to just throw that down the drain, he's my best friend and I can't imagine being without him. We're not great when it comes to confrontation, I tend to shut down completely because it's hard to get out what I actually want to say, so in the past month or so since he told me I shouldn't go with him, we've only talked about a few times kind of in passing and not very seriously, but he hasn't changed his mind so far. He mentioned once that he thinks it might be better for both of us to not be together, I moved in with him right after college so I guess he thinks it would be better for me to stand on my own.

&amp;#x200B;

We're in such a weird place right now, other than this weird looming expiration date on our relationship, we've actually been really good lately, we've just been having a lot of fun together. But knowing that my life is going to change drastically in some way or another in like 7 months is a very disturbing feeling and I guess I just don't know what to do about it. I'm hoping to convince him in this time that I do want to go with him. But what if he still leaves me here? What about this time where we basically know we're breaking up? Should we just break up now? I've been trying to ignore the fact that I'm falling apart inside but I need to get this out and get some advice on this, even though I guess I don't even know what advice there could be. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR Boyfriend of 9 years will probably be moving away next summer and doesn't think it's a good idea for me to go with him because I said I didn't want to leave home but have since changed my mind because I don't want to be without him. "

So during my master degree I did two research internship: one in my home country during the first year of master degree, I loved the subject, we published a paper.

I met a girl this year, she came from Japan., she was a one year exchange student.

The lab team wanted me to do the second year internship with them, and most likely a PhD after that. I decided to refuse and to do an internship in Tokyo. The subject was shit, the environment was shit. Everything was shit, but girlfriend was no more 10k km away so I was good with that.  
I graduated last year, started working as R&amp;D engineer in a SMB. Broke up three weeks ago with gf, told my boss this monday that I quit my job.

I wasted a golden opportunity to do PhD. My grades are quite low. Above the passing grade, but still. So I struggle finding a PhD position.

I'm totally lost.

I can do a voicechat interview if Ross would prefer.

9r2azh,11,2018-10-24,Any people with STEM degrees who are still struggling to get something?,Auronas,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/9r2azh/any_people_with_stem_degrees_who_are_still/,"STEM is often seen as some kind of golden ticket, which makes the fact that I haven't gotten a job that bit worse. I've applied for graduate schemes, graduate jobs, junior roles, internships, I even send out speculative applications (one reply was very kind and said my cover letter and project were great but they did not have the money in their budget to take on a junior right now but to stay in touch). 

I know my logic/mathematical skills aren't as strong as they should be so I have borrowed some logic/mathematics/algorithm books and am working through these while I apply for jobs. I really enjoy computer science but I'm not really sure I was smart enough to take this degree, I do struggle a bit with the puzzles they give in the interviews sometimes. 

It is also overwhelming sometimes how many steps a job application will have and how many hours you will give to it only to be rejected. Twice I've gotten to the assessment centre and failed which sucks after having dedicated so much time to a CV, personal statement, long application, numerical tests, technical tests, situational tests, video interview. Were there always so many steps in STEM graduate applications?"

I have passed P and FM, but have no internship experience and a comparatively low GPA (barely above a 3.0). Sitting for the next exam is difficult for me because money is tight until I get a job. In my free time I've started to learn more coding to become a more attractive candidate, as I'm already familiar with Excel.

I am only looking for positions within the central Texas area, and I understand that that greatly restricts my job prospects. I will continue to search and apply for actuarial openings, but at this point I figure my best bet is to get a job in a similar field and work there for a year or two before trying to transfer into an actuarial role with some experience on my resume. 

That said what jobs would you recommend that would transition well into an actuarial role? I've read underwriting is a good one as well as data science but from what I've read data science mostly requires a graduate degree.

Also with my GPA, would it be better to have it on my resume or keep it off? Will a company be more likely to dismiss a resume because of a low GPA or no GPA at all?

Any advice is greatly appreciated, the job search has been stressful but I'm very excited to actually start my career as an actuary. Thank you in advance for replying."

“So, it’s all true, what Sanita was saying?”   He asked as the elevator doors opened on nine.

“It’s fun to watch you folks from the outside world.”  She said, leading him down the hall.  “Fenris is weird, I’ll admit it, but from an organizational psychology perspective, it works.  It’s a generally healthy environment, less stress, less attrition, so the money continues to flow, you know?”  She found a frosted glass door.  A small sign read, ‘Colin Turner, Junior VP, BBB’.  “Look at that, they already have your nameplate up.”  She smiled and opened the door.  Colin’s first though was that it was a very small office, but then her realized it was a vestibule.  A petite blonde with shoulder-length hair sat behind a small desk.  She stood as they entered, straightening her glasses.  She had fairly large breasts, but the rest of he came off as mousy.  Janelle peered down at the name plate on the young woman’s desk.  “Natalie?”

“Yes.”  She said, her voice high and slightly nasal.

“This is Colin Turner, your new boss.”  Colin held out his hand, and the woman shook it demurely.  “Natalie is you secretary.  She’ll handle your scheduling with corporate duties, and you’ll inform her of how you want your day to look.  Can we go inside, Natalie?”  Janelle asked.

“The office is ready.  IT just finished about a half hour ago.  The wet bar and coffee station aren’t stocked, though, Mr. Turner; you can let me know what you want, and I’ll make sure it’s waiting for tomorrow morning.”  Colin had to restrain himself from whistling as they entered his office.  It wasn’t huge, but definitely bigger than the over-sized closet he had at his last job, and he had a view with floor to ceiling windows…not a corner, but still!  His desk was dark wood, with several large monitors, and two computers humming underneath.  Natalie walked over to the desk, her heels clicking on the laminate floor.  “This computer is your work terminal.”  She pointed at the computer in the white case.  “The other is for the internet and personal use.  We keep the networks separate, though if you need something brought over from the internet, I can do that for you.”  She offered.  Colin glanced at the empty coffee station and wet bar.

“Should I give you some cash to stock the bar?”   He asked.

“Um, no sir.  You are allowed up to $500 a month in petty cash for these things, but if there’s something special, then yes, you’d need to give me extra.”

“Natalie,” Janelle said, “just make sure he has some decent coffee, a selection of teas…”  The secretary quickly pulled out her phone and started tapping away.  “Some herbal tea and decaffeinated coffee pods, real cream, flavored creamer—every three days.  Vanilla?”  She looked to Colin.  It took him a moment to realize what she was asking, and he nodded.  “Vanilla creamer.  Also, a bunch of snacks.  He’s working with scientists, so he’ll need some junk food to keep them entertained if they visit.  Run a whole bar, vodka, gin, rum, scotch, so on and so on…you’ve been an executive secretary before?”

“Yes, ma’am, for a Junior Assistant Vice President.”  Natalie said.  Janelle looked at Colin, rolling her eyes a making a quick jerk-off gesture.

“So, you know what to get for an executive’s office, though maybe not one this big.  Anything special, Colin?”

“Um,” he shook his head, “I’ll let you know if I think of anything.”  He said to Natalie.  “That will be all.  You can go now, Natalie.”  She left them.

“Well, try out the desk…”  Janelle said.  He sat down, giving a slight smile.  “Get logged on, make sure your accounts are working.”  He did as she asked.  His work account lit up in moments.  A fast log on.  The internet computer took a minute more.  A warning screen popped up reading: Do not engage in illegal activities, to include piracy, gambling, or viewing pornography deemed illegal by the state or federal government.

“So, pornography is okay, but not *illegal* pornography…”  Colin shook his head.

“Given the sensitivity of our research and development, Fenris does not want the police, especially those who might be co-opted by competitors, snooping around.  Also, breaking the law is, you know, bad?”  She laughed, sitting on the end of his desk and crossing her legs.  “You’ll find some sites are blocked, like if you try to pirate something, or download some sketchy software, or look at freaky-assed porn, but here…let me show you.”  She got off his desk, giving him a brief look up her skirt.  She was wearing thigh highs again.  She leaned over him, and the scent of her was a mix of orange blossom and light vanilla.  The office was cool enough that he could feel the heat emanating from her body.  She typed at his keyboard and brought up a porn video site.  A woman on the screen was spread wide, another being fucked.  “See, no alarms.  Security is not on its way.  She played one of the videos, and moaning started coming out of his speakers as the woman on the screen was being fucked.  “I’m just trying to shock you out of your shell, Colin.  If you’re going to be a Fenris VP, you need to be more assertive.  Push the limits.  Stand up.”

“What?”   He asked, eyes on the video.

“I mean it.  Stand up.”   He stood, and she felt the front of his pants.  “See, you’re hard.  Let’s enjoy your view.”  She led him to the floor to ceiling windows lining the wall behind his desk.  She stood behind him and started undoing his pants.   He let her, not really sure where this was going, but she had her arms wrapped around him, and that was enough in the moment.  She pulled his pants and underwear down in one go and has erection popped through his shirt tails.  She started slowly stroking him while teasing his balls with her other hand.

“Janelle…”  He murmured.

“Huh…”  She said, removing a hand from his balls and pointing.  “I think that’s your house.”  She kept stroking him.  “I seem to recall giving a handjob to some guy in that hot tub.”  She increased her rhythm.  “The thing is, I’m having a hard time remembering, was that just some sad office drone I was I was giving a pity tug, or was that an executive at Fenris?”  She stopped jerking him.  “Well, are you going to answer me?”

“Janelle…seriously?”

“You could always bend over and pull up your pants, Colin.  While you’re down there, maybe I can fuck you up the ass…because that’s what’s going to happen with your employees if you don’t own this fucking job.”

“Fuck.”  He sighed.  “I’m an executive, okay?”  She moved in front of him, so he could see her face.  “Enough with this motivational bullshit.”

“With conviction, Colin.”  She started stroking him again.

“I’m an executive.”   He said.  “You gave a handjob to me, a vice president,” he said more forcefully.  “I—fuck—I’m an executive at Fenr—ahhh!”  He started ejaculating, his come splashing the windows.

“Mr. Turner, sir?  I found some water and sparkling water in storage, if you like me to—oh!  I’ll come back sir.

“Tell her to walk over here, Colin.  You’re her *boss*.”  Janelle stared right in his eyes, goading him.  She was still holding his cock, not letting any of the remaining semen drip on his pants.

“Um, Natalie, come here, please.”

“Yes…sir.”  She said.  He could hear her heels approaching.  She got in his view but kept her eyes on his face.

“Well?”  Janelle said.  “Tell her to help you clean up.  I’m not going to hold your cock all day.”  Colin told Natalie to grab some tissues, and the secretary moved to the window.  “No, Natalie.”  The woman stopped.  “I thought you said you worked for an executive?  Clean off his penis, then give me some tissues so I can move my hand without staining his trousers.”

“Mr. Keller never…”  Natalie started.

“Mr. Keller?”  Janelle snapped.  “Mr. *Keller*?  That does *not* sound like the name of your current boss, Mr. *Turner*.  I don’t care if Mr. *Keller* had you finger his ass while he motor-boated those big tits of yours.  Mr. *Turner* just enjoyed my expert handiwork, and he needs your assistance so he doesn’t have come-spotted pants when he meets his staff.  You are an *assistant*, right?”  Natalie looked down and away.  “No, look at me!  You wouldn’t even *be* in here if you’d followed protocol and knocked, knowing he was speaking with someone.  Mistake one, are we clear?”  She glared at the secretary.  “Or maybe mailroom clerk is more your speed?  Less people-oriented?”

“No, ma’am, of course not, ma’am.”  She grabbed a fresh tissue and started dabbing at Colin’s cock, trying not to look.   He watched in fascination as the young woman tried to dab up the bit of remaining come.

“Seriously?  What are they teaching you in the secretarial pool these days?  Take his cock in one hand,” she placed Natalie’ hand around his shaft, “give it a few gentle pulls to make sure the last of his jizz is out, and then clean up the rest.”  Natalie was slightly panicked.  She basically started jerking him off again, though it wasn’t doing anything.  “All right…enough.”  She stopped the girl.  “We must have hired you from a farm.  That,” she pointed to his cock, “is not a cow’s udder.  Tomorrow, and everyday thereafter, at oh-nine-thirty sharp, you will come in here, get him off, and clean him up properly.”

“Ms. Morley…Mr. Keller never had me—.”  The secretary froze mid-sentence.

“No, Natalie, by all means, tell me about Mr. *Keller*.  I *so* want to hear this story, and you *so* obviously want to tell it.  And, should you choose to continue, we can take you right down to the secretary pool and see where you might end up next.  So, what was this about Mr. Keller?”

“N-nothing, ma’am.”  She muttered.

“So, I expect Mr. Turner and I to get a meeting invite for the next month for ‘Skill Building’ at nine-thirty, right?”  Natalie nodded.  “Give me some tissues for this.”  Janelle held up her hand, spotted with come.  Natalie fumbled with the tissue box and it fell to the floor.  “God, never mind!”  She approached the woman and opened the front of her jacket, wiping her hand on the fabric of Natalie’s blouse, leaving wet stains on each of her breasts.  She rebuttoned the woman’s jacket and adjusted her lapels as if nothing was out of the ordinary.  “Stay here and clean up the rest of this mess.”  Janelle pointed to the window.  “Find some window cleaner, for god’s sake!”  She snapped as the woman once again moved to use tissues on the windows.  “Mr. Turner and I will be at the Executive Dining Room getting lunch if he is needed.”  Natalie dashed out, probably looking for something to better clean the window or least get away from Janelle’s commanding presence.  Janelle let out as breath, obviously frustrated.  “Are you going to pull those pants up or is your intent to show the other people in the dining room what a *real* swinging dick looks like?”

“Sorry.”  He pulled up his pants and started tucking in his shirt.  “I was distracted.”

“Orgasms will do that.”  She went over to the wet bar and started washing her hands.

“You were a bit harsh with Natalie.”  Colin said.

“I wanted you to see that she can take orders—*any* orders.  You want to be nice, or *pretend* to be nice, that’s up to you.  It’s better she learns not to fuck around *now*, right?  Before you really get into the work?  Her job is to make sure everything goes smoothly for you, regardless of the situation.”  He nodded.  “Come on, let’s get lunch.”  

The Executive Dining Room was on the top floor, with a patio, and full service.  Some of the other executives were drinking, but Colin abstained.  Janelle had a glass of white with her lunch.  All of the food was excellent, and the portions just the right size.  The last thing Colin wanted to be was sleepy before he met his team.  It was actually the dining room for junior executives and below, but Janelle still introduced him to a few others, including a woman, which was the first he’d seen of any real higher-level women at Fenris.  She was still very attractive, which seemed to be a primary hiring factor for female employees.  He noticed everyone knew Janelle, though she wasn’t normally allowed in that dining room on her own.  “Should we meet the team, or would you like to head back to your office, for a bit?”  Colin thought it best to meet them when he was fresh.  Three or later would likely find him a little out of it with the lingering jet lag.

----

**Chapter 7: Meeting the Staff**

“Gentlemen and *lady*,” Janelle said as she and Colin entered the lab space, “this is Colin Turner, the new head of BBB, and your new boss.  Gather ‘round please.”  Four men and a woman, all in lab coats, moved toward the small conference table set up near the door to the lab.  “Colin is the inspiration, as I understand it, for the new path you’ve been taking with the wristbands.”  She held hers up for display.  I’m not going to hang out here and listen to all the nerd talk, but please be gentle.  Colin is new, and if you break him, it may take weeks for us to find a replacement.”  The researchers laughed, and Janelle leaned over, telling him good luck, before leaving him in the lab.

“So, um, yes…why don’t we all sit?”  He realized there weren’t enough chairs after he said.  “Scratch that, sit if you want, okay?  Anyhow, I’m still getting settled, I’m a little jet-lagged, too, so I haven’t even had the time to read through the program highlights, so can someone volunteer to give me the elevator pitch?”

“Sure, okay.”  A tall guy with square glasses and a square haircut stepped forward a bit.  “Big fan of your work, by the way.  I’ve read some of your other papers, and your patents, and it’s just—.”

“Enough ass kissing, Gil, tell him what he wants to know.”  A shorter blonde guy with two days’ growth of beard snapped at him.

“So, I’m sure they told you how the bracelet works, the payment system and all, maybe the biometric lock, too?”  Colin nodded at Gil.

“It’s not really biometric, Gil, because it’s continuous measurement of—.”

“Stan, let me finish, please?”  He said back to the blond guy.

“Just trying to keep things accurate.”  Stan muttered.

“Gil, continue, please.”  Colin said, glancing at the others.  “And no more interruptions, please.”

“Excellent.  So, we’ve been working with your premise that by aligning the bio-systemic response with a user, it possible to create an ongoing feedback loop that…”  Gil continued for another five minutes, uninterrupted.  Colin followed fairly well, though he got lost a bit when Gil started drawing waveforms on the whiteboard nearby.  “And, well, we’ve been in early alpha for a little over a week.  The firmware update went out to a random and anonymous, set of candidates.  We actually send out a lot of updates, but the last was pretty big.  It expanded the test group a lot.  As part of the research team, we can tell you that those who are experiencing the effects of the update report occasionally feeling extra vibration in their bracelets.  They don’t know *why* they’re feeling that—we don’t tell them—but once you’ve been exposed to the pulses for a few days, you don’t notice it.”

“You’re, um, doing behavior modification experiments on unwitting human subjects.”  Colin frowned.  He remembered his wife mentioning her bracelet randomly vibrating.  He squinted at the thought.  “I’m aware Fenris does some unusual things, but this is—.”

“It’s agreed to, legal. Everyone who lives in Wolfsburg signs the charter, even visitors staying for longer than a few days.  You signed.  Your wife,” he nodded to Colin’s wedding ring, “signed it.  It’s non-invasive, impermanent.  Testing on that was completed over a year ago.  All of our current feedback indicates that it really only works on people who implicitly trust or respect the people giving direction.  Level of sobriety and sleepiness also benefits the process, but it’s not—.”

“Mind control.”  Colin said.

“Behavior modification for mood stabilization.  It’s kind of like taking a pharmacological solution, but without side effects.”  Another guy said, shorter, but well-muscled.  “I actually take mood stabilizers for anxiety.  I’m looking forward to possibility of *not* having to take them.”

“Because Mike can’t always get it up.”  Stan sniggered.

“Damn it, Stan,” Mike snapped, “he’s our fucking boss, you don’t have to tell—.”

“Guys, enough.  I’m not going to flip out here.  I’ve been briefed on the whole radical honesty thing.”  Colin looked at Mike.  “I don’t judge a man for taking responsibility for his health.”  He looked at Stan.  “I tend *not* to like people who attack others for things beyond their control.  I won’t hold it against you, but if you keep it up, I might over time.  Clear?”  Stan nodded.  Colin felt that was setting the tone sufficiently.

“Mind control implies you giving orders and the subject following them blindly.”  Mike continued.  “You can try that, of course, but you won’t have much success unless maybe that person is a natural subordinate, gets off on it.  Suggesting things, letting their own minds lead them down obvious paths, that’s what we’re striving for, and what we’ve at least partially accomplished thus far.  To be honest, if you were to map the project out right, we’d be at 15% of Fenris Group’s goal, but it’s a *big* 15%, even though it’s mostly in the realm of sexual response.”   Colin’s ears perked up, but he didn’t follow up with a question, as the fourth man started speaking.

“If we’re being honest, then.”   He was dark-haired with a matching, but well-cut, beard.  “I’m not sure you have the scientific rigor to back up your role leading this team.  Paper aside, an *idea* man isn’t necessarily going to break new ground, here.”

“Your name?”  Colin asked.  The man replied.  “Well, James, you are correct.  I don’t have a PhD.  I will depend on my experts in this room to keep me informed, guide me on what to read, and to keep my apprised of concerns, hurdles, roadblocks…you name it.  We’ll meet every morning at ten for a scrum, okay?”  They nodded.  “And you, Ms…?”

“That’s Kristie.”  Stan said.  “She’s just a lab assistant.”  Colin raised an eyebrow at Stan, who shrunk back.  He looked to Kristie expectantly.

“Welcome, sir.”  She said, pushing her long straight hair from her glasses.  “I *am* just a lab assistant.  Fenris hired me from the intern program, and I’m pursuing my master’s in biochemistry currently.  Completing that is the contingency for me being hired full time.”

“Excellent.”  Colin said.  She was young, probably just out of college.  Her light brown hair framed her face, and she was hidden under her lab coat.  He could tell she was nearly six feet tall, not overweight, and that was about it.  He was tempted to speak his thoughts on what he’d like to do with her—she had tempting lips—but he didn’t think it would make the best first impression for the team.  Based on what he’d seen and heard, many of the executives took their pleasure where they wanted, and he didn’t want to be a complete stereotype, at least in public.  “I want you to participate in all our discussions, Kristie, as *full* member of the team.”  She smiled at that.  “I won’t say there are no dumb ideas, because I will probably have some.”  They laughed.  “Still, you guys moved this project forward on what was basically a creative writing project of mine, so let’s pursue the science in that vein as well, okay?”  They nodded.  “I’ll read up on the project over the next few days, see if I can spot any inefficiencies, and we’ll tackle this from a programmatic standpoint at our Wednesday meeting.”  He left them to their and found his way back to his office.  Natalie was waiting at her desk and stood when he entered.  “Any messages?”   He asked.

“Ms. Morley said she’d be back by two-thirty to show you around campus grounds.  Would you like me to come along?”  She asked.

“Oh, I think we’ll be okay on our own.  And I imagine spending as little time around Janelle as possible would suit you just fine?”  He said with a smile.  “I’ll be in my office.  Call me if I’m needed, okay?”  She nodded and he went into his office, grabbing a water from the fridge, before sitting at his desk.  He noticed the windows—all of them—were sparkling.  Natalie had been busy.  Whether she’d done it herself or called the cleaners, he didn’t know, but following Janelle’s advice, he didn’t worry about it.  It was *done*.

He logged onto his work computer, changing the password, and starting reading up on the project.  It was called the ‘Sociability Effort’, which was both vague and slightly ominous given what they’d tried to accomplish.  He thought about his wife, and he wondered if she had been under any sort of influence over the weekend.  The lab crew had mentioned they’d mostly had success with sexual response.  And the random buzzing.  That might have described his wife over the weekend.  It’s not as if she’d never been spontaneous or sexy, but she’d let him photograph her in a way they hadn’t done since they were just out of college.  He pulled out his phone.  Her nude photos were still the most recent thing in his gallery, and her decided to take a few pictures of the view from his office to fill up some space.  He browsed through Alison’s photos, some of them were quite explicit, but he lingered on the facial he’d given her.  She didn’t look out of it.  She just looked like she was enjoying herself.  There was a knock at the door, and Colin shut off the screen on his phone.  Natalie walked in.

“Sir, um, I wanted to ask you…um, I’m not sure how to—.”

“Just say it, Natalie.”

“Do you really want me to, um, jerk you off every morning?”  She asked.

“Why do you ask, Natalie?”  Colin found himself enjoying this game.

“It’s just, Ms. Morley seemed intent on punishing me, and I wasn’t sure if—you didn’t seem to have an opinion either way.”

“Well, I have a sneaking suspicion Janelle will be here tomorrow at nine-thirty, at least.  And, like most men, I do enjoy a handjob.”  He let his statement linger.

“I…understand, sir.”  She bit her lip.  “I don’t, um, mind…I’m well aware of what goes on here at Fenris, what’s…expected.  This isn’t even a surprise, per se.  It’s just, my last boss wasn’t much interested in those sorts of things, but, really, I’ll do what I can.”  She walked over and set a bottle of lotion on the desk.  “If this is acceptable, I can use it tomorrow.”

“We’ll see what Janelle has to say, but yes, I’m okay with that lotion.”  He looked back at his screen, pretending to read.  “You can go now, Natalie.”  She muttered a ‘yes sir’ and turned on her heels.  “God, if it wasn’t my first day…”   He sighed, watching her ass sway out of the room.  He read for a little while longer, and eventually Janelle showed up in his office.

“Ready for the nickel tour?”  She asked.

“I suppose.”   He sighed.  “Can’t I just look at the website?”

“Oh, Colin, come on, you can’t be that tired.”  She took his arm leading him out into the hallway.  “I’m just going to show you some of the other buildings, the gym, parking options…it’ll be a nice walk.  Wake you right up.”

“I’d blame jet lag, but I was also reading through project notes.”  He said as they stepped out of the building.  Colin and Janelle both put on sunglasses.  “It’s a combination of very interesting and incredibly boring.”

“I believe you just defined most people’s work.”  She laughed.

“Don’t get me wrong, I’m really looking forward to getting into it, but starting from scratch is tough.”  She said nothing, and they walked past a few buildings.  She pointed out the main headquarters, an older and short building.

“The building has been here longer than the town.  It used to be the main gate and then a really long road leading to here.”  She said, pointing.  “Hit the *Executive* VP level and you might get an office in there.  Most people never set foot inside.  I’ve been in there once for a Christmas party about five years ago.  Much more boring than expected.  The way people talk about it, you’d think it was roman orgies in there all the time.”  She sounded almost disappointed.  “The gym’s over here,” she pointed to two-story structure that looked fairly modern.  He saw people coming and going in exercise clothes.  He was briefly distracted by several women in *very* tight workout gear.  “You get three hours a week for exercise, no questions asked.  Free exercise gear, which *does* make your ass look fantastic,” she nodded to the passing women in tight pants, “as parts of Clothing Development Division’s program.  Tell your secretary where you’re going, but other than that, feel free to go when you can.  It’s mostly a meat market during the day, though.”  She paused in her walk.  “Ah, here’s the final step for in-processing.”  She led him into a five-story building.  They took an elevator to the top, and Colin signed all his pay, tax, and benefits documents in ink.  He was done in less than ten minutes, and Janelle led him back outside.  “So, I mean, if you want, you can go home.  It’s sort of an unspoken rule that Junior VPs and higher come and go as they please.  There’s no real time card, per se.  You call in sick or tell someone when you’re taking vacation, but don’t think you have to clock in forty hours or more a week.”

“You’re serious?”  He asked.  “But they said in the HR meeting, that some people get fired for time sheets, or whatever.”

“Not *executives*.”  She said.  “But don’t get too excited.  I think you’ll find your days start to fill up quickly, and it’s not as if you get overtime.  As long as your job is getting done, no one really cares how you’re doing it.  Just show up for the meetings, stay on task, that sort of thing.”  She looked at her watch.  “The bus back to your neighborhood is coming in about twenty minutes.  Why don’t you call Natalie and tell her to lock up for you?  Surprise your wife—oh, wait, she’s still at the spa.  Well, have an extra beer or two in the hot tub, then.  No suit required.”  She grinned.

“I, um, I just realized I don’t have my office number, or Natalie’s desk either.”

“Well, I can’t blame you, really.  Hang on.”  She pulled out her phone and called Natalie, telling her to log off his computers and lock up his office when she was done for the day.  “Give me your phone now,” she said hanging up, “I’ll add your own contact info.”  He handed it to her, and she smiled, spending a minute swiping.  “Alison is *hot*.”  She said girlishly.  “I didn’t get a good look at her in the pool, but *very* nice, Colin.”  She said, showing him one of the fully nude photos he took of his wife.  “This was after I left that night, too…you have stamina, I’ll give you that.”  She grinned.

“Shit.  I forgot I had those open.”  He reached for his phone, but she pulled it back.

“You should totally set this one as your background image.”  She said, showing him the facial shot.  “Nothing says love like making your significant other look like a glazed donut.”  She tapped away at his phone for a moment.  “There, it’s all input into your contacts.  I also closed your gallery, you perv.”  She laughed, handing him his phone, which he jammed into his pocket, embarrassed.  “Oh, relax.  I think it’s sweet.”  She nudged his shoulder playfully.  “Well, I have some *real* work to do.  Do you think you can find your way home okay?” She pointed to the bus stop down the central walkway.  He nodded.  She gave him a quick peck on the cheek and walked off.

As Luis J. Gomez pointed out on the best ex fighter/comedian duo podcast, a lot of comedians who have been busting their asses off for a plethora of years haven’t even had an offer to film one. I myself have been doing open mics here in LA (born and raised in South Central LA, home of Ice Cube and Schoolboy Q, Ice Cube is huge drawl, been drinking Fresca with Ice Cubes my whole life my mans, ask Jay) for 2 years now and haven’t even been lucky enough to get raffled into the Cawlmuddy Stores(how guld is duh Calmiddy Stores right now?) meanwhile Schubert is up there in the Main Room doing his pathetic rendition of what he calls Cawlmudududy. Late last year I saw him there, fresh outta my shift at Chang’s, was almost late because I had an incredibly difficult time washing Cheeto dust from my finger. He was on the bill with the Mudererz Royals Royce: Adam Ray, Adam Devine(I love Maroon 9, B), Joe Rogan, Erik Griffin, Andrew Santino, and Dane Cook. Strawberry Shortcake went last after all of them and ate shit. His stand up is an on stage interpretation of what he figures is funny on TFATK, he was missing hard and wide with gay jokes, telling fight stories that involved such noises as GADOOOSH and AGHGHGGKK. Needless to say I left in the middle of his set even though there still 2 comics up after him, one of them being mommy jeans Christina P who I really wanted to see. Maybe he was hilarious and I was blinded by jealous hatred, and maybe he is a beast of a dad, and maybe he isn’t a deeply closeted homosexual brain damaged dimwit, but I experienced the opposite of all of that. Comedy is meant to be funny, there is nothing else to it, he was not making me nor anyone else there laugh. The man gets by with his name recognition, his isn’t a comedian, he’s a brand. He’s as funny as DJ Khaled is musically talented. It’s tough my mans.

9r48ur,2,2018-10-24,A long story about the build-up and current state of my relationship,classic_fire,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9r48ur/a_long_story_about_the_buildup_and_current_state/,"This is probably going to be way longer than anyone will think it should be, but I have a story whose contents I haven't been able to correlate and I need to get it into words.

In 2014 I was a senior in high school and one of my best friends (let's call him Nathan here) was really involved in Youth in Government. Nathan was the kind of guy who you met and immediately wanted to be friends with. I met and befriended him three years prior. He always just had this sort of aura that drew people in. Anyways, he and I would sit together at lunch most days, and even though he was one of my best friends, there were certain parts of his life he didn't really tell me about too often, so it came to my surprise when he started telling me about this girl he met on one of his Youth in Government trips. Let's call her Gabriela, or just Gabby. He was snapchatting her during lunch, and he would occasionally send her pictures of me for the snaps, which I didn't mind. I was more interested in the fact that he was dating someone long distance in high-school. I don't really know how that's a good idea. But he also recommended that I follow her on Twitter just for the hell of it. She had a private account at the time, so I had to request to follow her, and she let me. I don't know if Nathan ever talked to her about me or if she knew anything about me besides my face from snapchat, but she followed me back and we would occasionally interact on Twitter over some pictures of our cats, or something like that. 

Fast forward to our high-school graduation. It just so happened that Nathan and I had our graduation parties for almost the same time--I was able to make it to the first 15 minutes of his or so before I needed to go home and host my own. I remember briefly seeing Gabby across the party, but I didn't get a chance to meet her before it was time to leave. I didn't think much of it at the time, but I've thought a lot about that since.

Fast forward to the end of the summer, and I'm starting school in Holland, MI. About a month into school, I'm terribly lonely and depressed because that's the kind of person I am. I go to a coffee shop on a Saturday to get a drink to go and walk around the downtown area, and when the barista calls my name and I grab my drink, I hear someone shout across the coffee shop ""classic...classic_fire?"" I turn around, confused, and see Gabby running up to me to introduce herself. I recognize her from her Twitter picture, but I had no idea she lived in Holland. We awkwardly said hi at that point and then went our separate ways.

A couple of weeks later she messaged me on twitter asking if I was up for getting a coffee with her. I figured why not? I was lonely and bored all the time, and we had a mutual connection through Nathan, so let's meet. I learned a lot about her over coffee that first day. Turns out she was no longer dating Nathan, and it also turns out she was a grade below me and thus a senior in high school still. She went to a high school just down the street from my school. At the time, she was 16 and I was 18, just for reference. She was (still is) exceptionally smart and she skipped a grade.

After our first coffee ""date"" I don't know what was wrong with me but I didn't think I'd see her again, even though I had a really good time talking with her. But two weeks later I was lonely and decided to reach out to her again and see if she'd want to get coffee again. She did, and we saw each other again a couple of days before I went on this really stupid field trip to a prison in Kentucky for one of my courses. After that day, we really hit it off. We started texting all the time. I never wanted to stop talking to her. I remember tracking how many messages we sent to each other each week, and it was well over 1000 a week. She didn't live close to my school, so we only got to see each other once a week, more or less, but we were always talking. A couple of weeks later I decided to ask her out on a real date (we were just friends at this point), but before I asked her out I told Nathan I was going to ask her out, and he immediately called her and asked for her back. She said yes to him, so there goes that for me. I figure ""Okay. I've known her for a few weeks (ish) and I'm not, like, in love yet, so let's just be friends with her."" She and I continued to get coffee or the occasional dinner at least once a week for the last ten weeks of my first semester, even exchanging Christmas gifts before I left for the holidays.

Semester Two: Her car gets totaled in a minor accident, and I don't have a car, so we only get to see each other a couple of times all semester. Texting lets us keep in touch, but it's just not the same only texting someone. By the end of the semester, we barely talk.

Summer One: I'm still in Holland for the start of the summer doing research for the university. I bump into her downtown one day and we decide we should hang out again, but this is only a week before I leave for the summer because my research program was only 8 weeks. We hang out three times that week, doing things like going for hikes to the beach, etc. I give her a birthday gift and a graduation gift before I have to go home for the rest of the summer, and she tells me offhand that she loves me. I was too surprised to return the sentiment, and I was sure, anyway, that the sentiment I would return wouldn't be as ""friendly"" as hers. I might have really meant it.

Fall 2015: Semester One of Sophomore year: Gabby went to college just an hour away, the same school where Nathan went. They were still together. I tried to keep in some touch with Gabby, but she didn't seem all that interested in keeping in touch. I decide I'm going to make a trip to see them both one weekend. All the details are fleshed out for me to stay in Nathan's house for the weekend, but when I text him on Friday to tell him I'm on my way, he calls me to say he's not in school anymore--his dad had pulled him out the night before because he found out Nathan was taking ridiculous amounts of drugs. So my weekend plans are gone, and I give Gabby a quick call to tell her I'm not going to see her that weekend and why. Apparently she hadn't heard the news about Nathan yet, so I got to be the bringing of bad news there. And that's that. I don't see her until her quarter is done near the end of November and she comes back to Holland for a while. When she does come back, she and I grab a coffee and when she sees me she starts crying and hugs me. I'm not over her at all at this point and I just start asking her about what's wrong. Apparently Nathan was about as abusive as a boyfriend can get, forcing her to take drugs she didn't want to take, and on weeknights nonetheless. He was verbally and emotionally abusive as well, and made her feel worthless. I didn't really have anything to say back to her. I was basically just trying and failing to stop myself from falling in love with her.

Next time I see her is January 2016. We meet for coffee and she cries about how she caught Nathan cheating on her. I don't keep in touch with Nathan at this point--I'm pretty pissed off that he would hurt someone this badly.

Summer 2016: I haven't talked to Gabby for a long time. Probably not since January. I've tried to text her, but she doesn't really reply anymore. I've got an internship over in Wisconsin for the summer, and I realized over the course of the year prior that I had built her up in my head to be this perfect woman for me. I found myself comparing any other potential romantic interests to her and having them all fall short. I don't have any hard feelings toward her. Why would I? But if she's not going to be in my life and I'm going to unhealthily build her up to be this perfect match for me, I need to see her again to re-humanize her in my own brain. After my internship, I reach out to her and see if she wants to get dinner. She says that's fine, so I drive three hours each way to get dinner with her one night at the end of the summer, and it did not go how I wanted it to go at all. We hit it off better than we ever had before. After dinner we went to her house and sat on the porch and talked for hours. It was well after dark when I decided I should make the three hour drive back home. She only became more perfect to me after that, but the problem was she had a new boyfriend. So, well, fuck me. I hate myself at this point. She's so perfect to me, but I can never get the timing right to ask her out.

Fall Semester 2016: She tells me she would like to stay in touch more, as in a Skype call a week. I'm fine with that, so while she's interning in DC for the fall we talk at least once a week. Our talks are always for at least a couple of hours, and they only end because we have other shit to do. We never run out of content to talk about. I am torturing myself mentally at this point, falling more in love every time I hear her voice. When she gets back to Holland after her internship, I decide it's time to come clean and tell her how I feel. We grab a coffee and sit down to work on a jigsaw puzzle in the university library, and I start telling her how I wanted to ask her out 2 years ago, and how I've never been myself to stop from falling further in love with her. Her reaction doesn't help. At this point she's in a committed relationship with Nathan 2.0 (for lack of a better name) and she tells me she wishes I had asked her out way back then. That she doesn't know what she would have said, but that she's okay with me loving her. Basically, I was hoping she would tell me to back off, but she didn't.

Spring 2017: She's back in school, just an hour away, and our conversations about how we feel about each other are much more open now. We see each other almost every weekend, as I now have a car and can make day trips to hang out with her on weekends. She's still dating Nathan 2.0 and I never really meet him. When I visit her, we always just hang out by ourselves. Toward the end of the semester, my graduation is coming up (I graduated in three years) and we are clearly both getting worried about it. My plan at the time was to move to Madison, WI to go for a PhD, and she still had two years of school. It seems like it's the end, even though we don't say it and neither of us wants it to be the end. She ends up coming to my graduation in May, and gives me a card that fucking tears me to pieces for the rest of the summer (or even still). She tells me in the card that she loves me and that she wishes things had been different because we would have been really good together. She says she will join me in Madison in two years. Before I leave Holland for ""the last time,"" she gives me a kiss on the cheek, and I catch her crying before I drive away. There is no resolution.

Summer 2017: I have no job, no real commitments. I need to find funding for my grad program, but I have four months to do that. I have a lot of time to think and to re-read the card she wrote me. I fall into a pit of anxiety and despair that I'd never known before, just wishing we could have made something work between us, but also holding on to this hope that it wasn't the end, because we never said it was the end. I visit a friend in Holland one week this summer and I hang out with Gabby every day that week. It turns out that Nathan 2.0 cheated on her, but she's still trying to make their relationship work. This fucks me up. I can't even explain how fucked up my head was at this point. I couldn't keep the events of the last three years in chronological order anymore. Everything felt fucked.

August 2017: Gabby comes to visit me four times this month. We go to art museums, I show her around Madison, she shows me around Milwaukee (where she stays with her aunt), and we get real again about our feelings for each other. Nathan 2.0 is in Ecuador studying abroad, and she's still trying to make it work with him. She tells me her Tumblr url, and one morning after we spent the previous day together, I check it and see a long love letter to me on it. I text her about it, and she says she forgot I had her tumblr url, gets all embarrassed, and takes it down.

Fall 2017: I start my PhD, but I am not in a good place mentally. I live alone in an apartment, and I had just turn 21, so I start experimenting with alcohol an unhealthy amount. In doing so, I get really honest with myself standing in front of the mirror, and I carve up my arms really badly with various kitchen knives. 

Gabby breaks up with Nathan 2.0 late September 2017. Gabby is my plus-one to my brother's wedding on September 30th. I'm my brother's best man, so on the day of the wedding I don't get to see her much until the reception. When I show up and give my speech, she's already extremely drunk, to the point that we have to call an ambulance and get her to the hospital. I sit with her the whole night until they let her go, which is like 4am the day after the wedding. We go back to the hotel and my room is occupied by my other brother and his one-night-stand, so I stay with Gabby. We don't do anything more than cuddle, and she's obviously not in an emotionally stable place. She tells me at one point that she ""has a thing for PhD candidates."" 

The Monday after the wedding, I withdraw from school. I couldn't hold myself together anymore. I go and visit Gabby two weekends later, and we know it's foolish but we decide to start dating long distance. We both wanted to, and it was too soon after her previous relationship and both of our breakdowns, but then, maybe we could help each other out. So we start dating long distance, 300 miles away, and I start working full-time as a software developer in November. My family has all met her and my family thinks she's great. I'm very in love. One of us makes the drive to see the other every other weekend, and everything gets really good really quick. She gets Seasonal Affective Disorder really bad, and I sit with her whenever I can to help her through her depression. I spend almost every weekend I see her just sitting with her and trying to get her to stop pulling out her hair or scratching her arms until she bleeds, and I'm fine with it, because I'm in love. We get through the winter, and come summertime she's planning on staying with me for the summer. Except two weeks before she finishes her quarter, she gets caught smoking weed and is arrested. Suddenly, she can't leave the state of Michigan for six months to come visit. I assure her this is okay. I'm not leaving her. I visit her every other weekend and make sure she's doing okay while she's on probation. The summer ends and she starts school again, just this September, and out of nowhere she tells me that she needs a break from me. That she doesn't want to see me until she graduates (which is in November), and she doesn't want to talk to me either, but that after she graduates we will reconnect and try again.

Now I'm here just trying desperately to figure out where I went wrong. I don't know. I'm hopelessly in love with her. She's the only woman I've ever dated, the only woman I've even really wanted to date, and suddenly she's just gone from my life for a while. I don't know what to do and I'm trying to hold myself together, but I don't know how. I just don't know how.


TL;DR: I don't want there to be a tldr version of this. Just read the story."
9r4mkv,0,2018-10-24,I am living in Chickentown,Up_N_Da_Club,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9r4mkv/i_am_living_in_chickentown/,"In case the title of this post and my username didn't give it away, I'm a huge fan of 'The Sopranos', and finished it up for the first time last month. One thing that cements the show as being my favorite show of all time is the amazing music selection the show has. The music, with the exception of the Rat Pack and Italian songs, is hardly ever what you'd expect, but always fits perfectly with whatever scene it's accompanying. One song, however, sticks out the most to me. In the episode 'Stage 5', the episode ends with Phil meeting with Butchie at bar. During their conversation, Phil laments over how his 'compromises' for the family haven't come back to benefit him, and how he feels great anger and anguish over doing nothing to avenge his fallen brother. Before Phil's about say his final words to Butchie, a quiet, pulsating rhythm starts to build up. It gets subtly louder each second, until Phil says to his friend, ""No more, Butchie. No more of this."" And as soon as Phil's done saying his line, a spoken word poem of all things starts to get performed over the ever increasingly loud and eerie beat. The poem is performed by a man named John Cooper Clarke. I'm already straying too far from the main point already, so I'll just include the lines that stick out to me the most.

""The bloody scene is bloody sad
The bloody news is bloody bad
The bloody folks are bloody daft
Don't make me bloody laugh
It bloody hurts to look around
Everywhere in chicken town
The bloody train is bloody late
You bloody wait you bloody wait
You're bloody lost and bloody found
Stuck in fucking chicken town""

This song stuck-out to me more than any other song I had heard in the series for many reasons. Obviously, it stood out tremendously because it's spoken word poem performed by a punk poet from Manchester featured in a show about middle-age, Italian-American mobsters in New Jersey. But, the lines and subject matter struck me instantly as I first heard it, but I wasn't sure why. I'd heard plenty of songs dealing with frustration towards the world around you before, so that really didn't make it special. Then, it finally hit me one day; it stuck out to me so much because I am living in my own Chickentown.

I started college around the middle of August at a decent-sized state university in my hometown. I did well in high school; I had a good amount of close friends that I hung-out with all the time, was involved heavily in stage production and A/V stuff, had a few long-lasting romantic relationships, and did well enough academically to graduate in the top 15% of my class. Sure highschool also had a lot of really terrible things go along with it, which I don't feel like delving into now, that made it a less than desirable experience, but enough things went right enough for me to get accepted to this really prestigious and exciting private university in one of the biggest cities in the country. For someone living in a preeminently small, rural, poor area, it was an opportunity I was itching to jump on. Sadly, the cost to go to the this school was far greater than what me and my parents could afford without us taking out nearly $200,000 in loans for just the undergrad years, so I let the opportunity pass. After all, there was a good sized university just down the road, and they'd pay me to go there. I was initially disappointed that I had to compromised my college choice, but I was still very eager to get out of high school and jump into my studies and college life. I had it all planned out with the help of my therapist; I was gonna join all these clubs and organizations, make all sorts of new friends in addition to keeping all my old friends from high school that also decided to go here, kick ass at all my studies, and of course date all sorts of women. Robert Burns (and Nujabes/ Cise Star) said it best; 'The best laid plans of men and mice are never right'

Ever since coming to college, I've been more reclusive than ever before, more angry than ever before, more anxious than ever before, more bored than ever before, and more vilified than ever before. I have no clue what it is or what's caused it. It's almost like I somehow managed to forget how to socialize and interact with people, and it certainly isn't for lack of trying, because I am very involved on campus. I DJ for the radio station, I attend almost everything done by the campus ministry I'm in, I'm a part of a group that volunteers at the pediatric ward in the local hospital, and I intern for the student government association (student government doesn't let freshman run, but they have an 'apprentice program', but it's more or less an internship). I've always been called and considered a weird or odd person, but my friends back in high school would call me names like that in an endearing way, almost to show that they loved me because of how I was, not in spite of it. I've been called strange and odd by more people here than I can count on two hands, and all of it has been in an insulting manner. People have treated me like I'm some sort of escaped mental patient whenever I so much as say a sentence or two, especially if I'm sharing my opinion on something. And the thing is, I have no clue how I'm being weird or odd. I don't intentionally do things for the sake of being weird; I do the things I do because I wanna do them. I guess my brain is just hardwired in someway that it just does things that only I think is pretty ordinary, but isn't to pretty much everyone else. I can't stand it. It would be one thing if it was just a group of outliers, but it just becomes incredibly disheartening, frustrating, and discouraging whenever almost everyone I talk to acts like I'm from another planet. It doesn't help the fact that I hardly have anything in common with anyone I've met here. I don't listen to any of the artists that the people I know listen to, I hate parties because they make me an anxious wreck (fun fact: I actually tried to go to one after the homecoming football game last week, and turned back after I nearly started hyperventilating when I saw all the people there), I don't drink or smoke anything, and hell, I don't even have a Netflix account. And this isn't me trying to pretend I'm some holier-than-thou, pretentious, hipster-ish asshole who's better than everyone, I just like what I like and dislike what I dislike for whatever reason. It just becomes very, very hard for me to establish common ground with and talk to people on campus, no matter where I go or who I meet. Now, here's the part where I contradict the part where I said I'm not a pretentious asshole. I've also noticed that are just so many people who, if I can be frank, just should not be in college, and don't get me wrong, there's not really anything wrong with that. My stepdad never went to college, and he's incredibly intelligent and successful. Trades are severely overlooked by people my age, and I honestly wish I could pick up a trade if I had the skill for it. But the people I'm talking about are just absolutely not ready for college. They have no plan, no goals, no drive, and no passion for learning, and it just baffles me that anyone would be going to college if they didn't have at least one of those things. Granted, my college has an acceptance rate of nearly 90% with a graduation rate of less than 45%, so it's not like they're being selective with who they take in, but it's honestly a slap in the face to people who actually want to learn and have a drive to get smarter whenever they let some of these people on campus. And it's not like we're doing some high level stuff already; everyone is taking their easy af generals and maybe one class for their major. I don't take notes and I don't read, and I still have all A's, and it's certainly not because I'm all that smart, it's just that the classes are so, so damn easy if you give like 40% of effort. Hell, I've seen people in my sociology multiple times just say the most basic shit or even just reword the question into a statement to answer questions during in-class discussions, and get counted as correct, so my only conclusion is that if you're struggling with classes like that at this university, you probably shouldn't be in college in the first place. Even overlooking that, there's so many people that are just flat-out ignorant, too. Not in the sense that they lack intelligence, but in the sense that they can't stand opinions that don't line up with their own. The very cruel irony is that I've noticed this trait is far more prevalent with many of my fellow honor's college students than anyone else on campus. To give an example of what I mean, there was this girl that lives down the hall from me, and we used to talk and hangout a lot during the first part of the semester. Then, we got into a disagreement over something and have since stopped talking. Sounds like it must have been over something pretty serious, right? Here's the thing, though; I have no clue what the hell the disagreement was or what it was about. I only found out this is the reason why we stopped talking after someone else told me this after they were hanging out and the girl who I had this apparent 'disagreement' with told the other person that ""she didn't need that negativity in her life"". This was apparently enough to stop being friends with me entirely, even though it was literally ONE DISAGREEMENT THAT I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER, so I don't even wanna know what would've happened if we had a major disagreement over something that really mattered. I know my opinions aren't the most popular here on a college campus, but I honestly don't say anything that's all that controversial, and yet still get looked at like I'm some sort of evil demagogue. It's starting to drive me insane that I can't even so much as not fully agree with someone and have them attack and dislike me over it.

I won't even get into the whole dating thing because you already know it's a train-wreck. I don't even so much as say 'Hi' to a girl I see on campus because I know how well that'll go over, so I just use that godforsaken Tinder to meet women, which is probably the worst idea I have ever had. I get matches on there, but actually getting a real, date-ass date with someone is some sort of voodoo magic that I have no clue how to do. Not like the people on there wanna do that anyway, obviously.

I can feel my mental break happening soon. Everyday, it's the same people, doing the same things, with the same conversations, and it's driving me up a damn wall. I have no clue how to make connections and relationships with people anymore for whatever reason, and I'm apparently a really unlikable asshole all of the sudden. I can't help but feel like I'm not reaching my full potential and wasting away these four important years by staying at a school like this. My classmates dislike me because I'm an unintentional werido with bad opinions and poor taste in everything who doesn't know how to have fun. I can't stand this dying, depressed, drug-addicted town that offers no real future for any of the young people in it. I can't stand living in bloody Chickentown."

9r4ypa,0,2018-10-24,I don’t know what to do anymore.,throwaway042910,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9r4ypa/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"Some background: for the last 8 years I have really struggled with my mental health. Severe and chronic depression, undiagnosed ADHD, social anxiety, general anxiety, self-loathing, low self-esteem, etc etc etc. I’ve attempted suicide once but survived when my boyfriend came home early to find me with the razor in my hand. I’ve also been in school trying to get my undergrad at the same time. As you can imagine, it’s been nearly impossible. 

I was almost dismissed due to abysmal grades, but before I was, I decided to withdraw. I worked as a deli clerk in the meantime, trying to make ends meet with my boyfriend. Those years were hard. We were poor and barely managed to buy groceries. It was a miracle when he landed a job working for the state with his Bachelor’s; the benefits and pay were a huge relief. He’s managed to work his way up from the grunt to the big boss in three years with his work ethic. I love him with all my heart. We were finally in a place where I felt good, my meds and home was stable. I decided to go back to school. I was still on probation, like I had been before and this was my last chance.

I’ve always wanted to enter the medical field, something I’ve wanted to do for as long as I can remember. But I couldn’t decide on what until recently. I want to be a PA, I’ve shadowed one and I absolutely love it. So I worked hard last semester, my first semester back. I managed to bring my ~1.7 GPA up to a 2.1 by getting all A’s for the first time since elementary school. I was off probation. I signed up for the classes my advisor told me to. One of those courses was a general A&amp;P course, since I was told my school didn’t offer human A&amp;P, and while PA schools require human A&amp;P, they will accept it if it isn’t offered at your school. My plan was to apply for schools in the fall of 2019, to matriculate in the spring. I still need to get my patient care experience, and I’m having trouble finding something that can accommodate limitations from a back injury I had the summer before I withdrew.

Well, today at my 10-semester hold advising meeting with a new advisor, I found out that my school does offer human A&amp;P, and always had. My old advisor clearly doesn’t work there anymore for a reason. I have to take the first semester over the winter, and do the second one in the spring. I have no other choice, since I have to graduate this year. My financial aid is capped. I have taken out the max $37k loans for undergrad and there is no way I can afford to pay out of pocket. As it is, taking the course over the winter might leave me a little short for the spring. 

I always knew getting in to PA school was a long-shot. My GPA is low, and even getting all A’s from here on out will bring me to just under a 3.0, the minimum required for every PA school I’ve looked at. But I though I could make it work, if I got a high GRE, I had good recommendations, I managed to find a job in patient care, and show that I really want this, because I want this more than anything. But, not only do some of the schools I’ve looked at require labs to be in person(the lab is online in the winter) but I realized that some of my general science courses are reaching the 10 year limit by matriculation most schools have. By the time I apply, they’ll be expired. And I can’t take them again, since I have no means of doing so. My boyfriend makes good money, but we were in a lot of debt previously and are steadily working our way out. 

I have no job experience except a deli-clerk. I have no research experience since the hours weren’t compatible with my boyfriend and we share one car, and live an hour away from my school(and incidentally his work). I never did an internship since I had to work to pay the bills. My degree is a science one, but it’s biology and it’s all over the place. I have no applicable skills to anything really. Some experience with lab equipment, but not much beyond that. Who is going to hire someone like me? What grad program will accept me? My degree is going to be nothing more than a $37k piece of paper. 

My hopes and dreams are burning before my eyes, and I don’t know what to do anymore. The past few months have been really hard. This semester has been tough, I have new ADHD meds, and my mom was diagnosed with colon cancer this summer. Our car broke down and cost us $1200 we didn’t really have. I hate my job at that deli, and I’ve been dealing with some issues with other personnel. I don’t have many friends, since I never really have time to hang out. I try to reach out to my sister, and I get short conversations and then nothing. She never reaches out to me. When I told my mom the other day how hard it’s been lately, she didn’t even comment on it and just scolded me for not being able to take her to her chemo appointments. My sister hasn’t taken her to one, and my mother just says well of course because she’s busy. I’m 26, almost 30 and I feel like a failure. I want to be successful so badly and it’s looking impossible. The other day I realized that if I were to die tonight, the only person who would genuinely care that it was me that was gone, would be my boyfriend. Everyone else would just be sad because that’s what you’re supposed to be. My family would be sad but in a way that drew attention to their suffering and it wouldn’t be about me, because they hardly know me. If I act myself around them, they become distant and cold. No one but my boyfriend would miss ME. I’m sorry for such a long post, but I’ve been on the study floor in the library crying all day and I need to say it to someone. I’m sorry if this seems overly dramatic and I sound pathetic, I’m sure no one gives a shit, but I just had to say it.

All my hopes and dreams are burning, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I look out the window, and I want to jump. "

For anyone that has any experience with this, what level of Python knowledge is needed to be useful as an intern? I'm most of the way through SoloLearn's Python lessons (I have some basic knowledge with JavaScript as well), I'm doing exercises on other websites, and I plan to do group projects after finishing to cement my basic knowledge. I would love the opportunity to work and improve with the knowledgeable folks at Red Hat, but I'm worried about being in over my head. Can anyone give me an idea of what their experiences with this are? Thanks!"
9r52iv,3,2018-10-24,"Happy birthday to me, I guess",IceQueenCat,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9r52iv/happy_birthday_to_me_i_guess/,"I (F) am 22 

It was my birthday yesterday. I got plenty of birthday wishes from family and friends. I feel loved. Except I’m torn.

I love my roommate  (F, platonically). We’ve been best friends for over a decade now. I’ve been there with her through so much and vice versa.

Last year, the love of her life (M) died in a tragic accident. Our main friend group all knew him. He was a great dude and shouldn’t have died so young. It was such a rough time for all of us. He grew up with us.

Of course, I was there for my roomie. In college, I’m her main support from our original friend group. The sadness comes in waves. I don’t know what I’ll walk home to. If she’ll be okay or bawling on the floor with mascara running down her cheeks.

I’ve missed classes for her during these times. Missed events for my internship. I’ve bought her alcohol and candy to cheer her up and had many movie nights to take her mind off things.

Everything I do, she’s reminded of him. I turn on the lights and roomie says, “oh, he loves to light up the room.” I eat some green beans, “oh, he loves green beans.” I lay on my bed, “he used to do that.” You get it.

It feels like every conversation we have it somehow goes back to him. Of course, we’ve tried to help her move on. She’s been to therapy but has stopped since college started. She works at the place where he drowned. My friend is trying to get her a new job since that can’t be good for her.

Living here is so hard. He used to be in our apartment all the time. I’m supposed to be the strong one. I’m supposed to be the one she can depend and lean on, but who am I supposed to go to? I’m not strong enough on my own and I don’t want to burden my friends with this. They already know it’s tough. 

As said above, it was my birthday yesterday. I’m 22. And the roomie did nothing. After everything we’ve been through. I was home all day. She was home all day.
I feel guilty for feeling this way. She’s been through so much crap in her life and here I am complaining about how she didn’t do anything for my bday...

Just wanted to get that off my chest. Even if it makes me sound like an asshole."

The last two paragraphs I especially struggle with trying to articulate, explaining the web of influence and how it works is difficult to put into words and I have rewritten it so many times it is infuriating.

Let me know what you think, any extra material you have.

The Kochs [historical background](https://www.reddit.com/r/KochWatch/comments/85xtfv/the_kochs_reason_magazine_robert_lefevre_and_the/?st=jmaeoyso&amp;sh=95a891c5) with [extreme elements](http://www.unkochmycampus.org/los-preface/) - they and their fathers history with the John Birch Society, Robert LaFevre, and Murray Rothbard - is already documented and Nancy MacLeans book examines their association with [James McGill Buchanan](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/meet-the-economist-behind-the-one-percents-stealth-takeover-of-America).

But their contempory interactions and funding aren't as well understood or clearly documented. 

What they point to is the Kochs being a major influence on promoting extremists and the pipeline from libertarianism to anarcho capitalism to the altright.

[Charles Murray](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-white-man-unburdened-slobodian-schrader), author of the infamous Bell Curve, was supported in the 1980s by Koch funded think tanks Heritage Foundation and Manhattan Institute and today is a fellow at [the American Enterprise Institute another Koch funded think tank and David sits on the board of directors.](https://www.aei.org/scholar/charles-murray/)

Garret Jones, an economist at George Mason University (the largest recipiant of Koch funding on college campuses with 95 million between 2005-2015 and earlier this year it was discovered they have in fact obtained control over the hiring and firing of faculty) [whose recent monograph was positively reviewed by VDARE in July 2017. Jones draws heavily on the work of white supremacist and eugenicist Richard Lynn, and even personally thanked the Pioneer Fund figurehead in an article he published in the Journal of Economic Growth in 2005. In 2015 Jones delivered a lecture which argued that less democracy in the United States would lead to better governance.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/stefan-molyneux)

(You have to scroll down a bit to the timeline of interviews)

Florida Atlantic University professor Marshall DeRosa is a member of the [League of the South](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/league-south) and [employed by the Kochs for their 'prisoner outreach'.](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-charles-koch-is-helping-neo-confederates-teach-college-students/)

[Assistant Professor Jonathan Anomaly at the Department of Political Economy and Moral Science at the University of Arizona, which has received 1.8 million from the Kochs and 2.6 million from their associates, published an article Public Goods and Education. In it Anomaly discussed the value of exploring links between genetics and IQ of different racial groups, and the value of eugenics. And elsewhere opposes public education, something the Kochs have long promoted.](https://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2018/01/02/libertarians-on-public-government-schools-from-milton-friedman-to-the-koch-brothers-to-ua-and-asu-an-incomplete-history)

These three come just from stories found on /r/KochWatch, considering how much money they spend on colleges, endowments they have provided, schools they have set up on campuses how many more are there?

Through [Donors Capital Fund](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Donors_Capital_Fund) the Kochs fund Daniel Pipes Islamophobic 'think tank' Middle East Forum.

[The Kochs, along with the Mercers and DeVos, fund another think tank Young America's Foundation that funded those lecture tours that caused so much commotion featuring Murray, David Horowitz, Ann Coulter, Ted Nugent, Milo Yiannopoulos. Its board member James B. Taylor is the former president of the National Policy Institute, now run by altright icon Richard Spencer.](https://www.alternet.org/right-wing/rightwing-billionaires-are-intentionally-funding-hate-speech-college-campuses) Other speakers it has sponsored have included [Robert Spencer](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/robert-spencer), and now [Ben Shapiro](https://www.yaf.org/shapirotour/).

A new think tank employing many Koch alumni is [Speech First](https://www.thenation.com/article/dark-money-behind-campus-speech-wars/), its funding is not yet known but the millions it spends far outstrip what its student membership fee raises and claims it makes are in line with many here.

[Dave Rubin](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAYFgmOWAI) now receives funding from [many Koch groups](http://progressivearmy.com/2018/04/06/dave-rubins-sudden-political-change-receiving-money-koch-brothers/).

Charlie Kirks TPUSA [is also Koch linked](https://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/who-funds-conservative-campus-group-turning-point-usa-donors-revealed-2620325). (NB: the author identifies two of its financiers as Koch funded but missed that Reason Foundation and Foundation for Individual Rights in Education are *also* Koch funded meaning that *four* of its sources of funds are funded by the Kochs)

In Canada, Rebel Media was founded by Ezra Levant – [formerly he worked at the Koch funded Fraser Institute and did his internship at the Charles G. Koch Foundation]( https://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/2012/04/25/charitable-fraser-institute-accepted-500k-foreign-funding-oil-billionaires?page=0,1). It has received [funding](https://pressprogress.ca/exclusive_rebel_media_ezra_levant_received_foreign_funding_from_anti_muslim_think_tank/) from the Middle East Forum, which the Kochs fund. And has [produced](https://pressprogress.ca/rebel-media-produced-anti-muslim-propaganda-with-foreign-group-funded-by-trumps-top-donor/) anti-Muslim attack ads with them featuring far-right personalities.

Rebel Media has been a regular platform for Jordan Peterson [who they have raised money for](https://thevarsity.ca/2017/05/01/jordan-petersons-federal-funding-denied-rebel-media-picks-up-the-tab/), Lauren Southern, Gavin McInnes, and Faith Goldy - who favourably cite Richard Spencer.

Jordan Peterson also often recommends [Koch linked groups](https://mobile.twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/968633924724256768), pals around with Dave Rubin, [and appears at TPUSA events with Kirk, Shapiro and other Koch linked speakers](https://www.reddit.com/r/KochWatch/comments/9oigpu/charlie_kirk_and_tpusa_koch_funded_host_jordan/?st=jnb3u6u5&amp;sh=9e9a5295).

The [Charles G. Koch Foundation](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Koch_Family_Foundations) - where Ezra Levant did his internship - has contributed significantly to Tucker Carlsons The Daily Caller. The Daily Caller has reported [very favourably on the Charlottesville altright march, its journalist Jason Kessler addressed the marchers 'in which he praised fascist and racist organizations, thanked a prominent Holocaust denier, and declared the beginnings of a cultural “civil war.”](https://www.propublica.org/article/things-got-left-out-of-the-daily-callers-report-confederate-monument-rally) Kessler has many links to the far right and white nationalists. But he [is not the only one there](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/08/16/daily-caller-has-white-nationalist-problem): one of its contributors is the founder of VDARE - which reviewed Garret Jones favourably - several contributors have also written for it, several associate with Richard Spencer who remember took over from James B. Taylor at the National Policy Institute.

Without a doubt its content and staff are far more upfront and provocative than any other group or person yet listed here.

And for additional evidence, the high school carriculum they donate when schools run short of funding ([because of Koch backed efforts](https://qz.com/1245033/this-koch-brothers-backed-law-stops-states-from-raising-teacher-salaries/) to cut taxes that fund them): [1](https://www.theroot.com/millions-of-students-are-quietly-being-taught-the-koch-1823742091), [2](https://www.alternet.org/human-rights/what-koch-brothers-want-students-learn-about-slavery).

As the Garret Jones link demonstrates Stefan Molyneux maintains connections to Jones, the von Mises Institute founded by their former associate Rothbard, Murray who is Koch funded, the League of the South which DeRosa is associated with, and others in the emerging altright, which are all Koch linked either through direct funding or associating with those they fund.

The conventional economists and think tanks they support are combined with the academics that provide an 'intellectual' underpinning to ""racial realism"" and the groups pushing the mantra of 'liberal' take over of college campuses and society being under threat by the likes of Rubin, Peterson, Kirk, Molyneux and outlets like Rebel Media, Western civilisation itself according to contributors at The Daily Caller, to motivate disaffected young men and provide simple emotionally appealing explanations for what the cause of their problems are, all the while advancing into the mainstream extreme views and directing their audience to support campaigns and politicians the Kochs back.

What this should all point to is that the Kochs are not merely classical liberals or libertarians concerned with government overreach, but rather while we have no direct quotes we can nevertheless surmise from their repeated pattern of associations and funding that the Kochs seek to create a 'let the chips fall where they may' institutionally-biased racism concealed within economic jargon.

And it should also point to a confluence of these academics and media personalities pushing a demographic to an increasingly extreme position that welcomes conflict.

As one of their pet academics once said:

&gt;In support of building their own youth movement, another speaker, the libertarian historian Leonard Liggio, cited the success of the Nazi model. In his paper titled ""National Socialist Political Strategy: Social Change in a Modern Industrial Society with an Authoritarian Tradition,"" Liggio, who was affiliated with the Koch-funded Institute for Humane Studies (IHS) from 1974 to 1998, described the Nazis' successful creation of a youth movement a key to their capture of the state. Like the Nazis, he suggested, libertarians should organise university students to create group identity."

My two main areas of interest currently are data science and cybersecurity, but I am having trouble seeing where I could fit in to Microsoft's Engineering groups if I am selected. I don't see any teams clearly dedicated to security, and I heard that asking to be on the AI/Research team is a bad idea because it is so selective.

I'm a female and 5'7"" and a half. I've weighed 120 at my lowest in high school and 150 at my highest when I was 10. 

Right now I'm about 140-145 pounds. Last year at this time I was 130, wore size 4, ate very healthy.  Now my thighs rub together in places I didn't know was possible and had to order new jeans in a size 6/8. 

This past spring semester at college (and this semester) is terribly stressful. I am a senior searching for a full time 600 hour internship by myself and I just can't stop stress eating. I am vegetarian and generally eat healthy but I see myself straying. While I don't eat fast food, I'm relying more on boxed mac and cheese with frozen vegetable than the homemade vegan/veggie recipes I'd make last year. Time is also an issue. I have classes morning, afternoon, and night and I'm a very lazy person. 

I have a planet fitness membership and I've tried working out in the past but *I freaking hate exercise!* I've never felt a high from it, I hate it, but I know it's necessary for me. I'm so out of shape my heart rate will be 185 after walking on the treadmill at 4mph for 20 minutes. Exercise makes me want to puke. 

Also, diet wise, I only drink water and the occasional coffee a few times per week. No soda, sugary drinks, etc. unless it's special. I can only eat sweets if it's after a healthy meal but I generally do this every single night after dinner and I know I shouldn't.. but.. stress. I also like carbs a lot (pasta especially, I don't eat bread) but try to limit them. I love veggies and most fruits (except berries) though, I try to eat veggies with dinner every night and fruit with breakfast (which admittedly is a protein bar on the go I don't even get to eat until 11:30). I don't get hungry often and survive on small breakfast and then moderate dinner. 

I'd love support, advice, anything to help me.

I'm a university student (21) located in Melbourne and I've recently acquired an internship in Newcastle that requires me to relocate from 26/11 to 22/2.

I thought I'd ask the subreddit what the best options are for long-term accommodation.

Personally, a share house is out of the question unless it becomes literally the only option. I understand that it's the cheapest option but a share house is just not for me - I'm far more happy to pay a little bit extra for accommodation to myself and my girlfriend when she comes to visit. My budget at the moment is around $300-$450 p/w.

I've had a look at realestate.com.au as well as Domain. There are nice apartments on there within my budget, but I'm not sure how likely it is that someone would lease to me for 3 months when I can't get up to Newcastle to inspect either. Maybe this is easier than I think it is?

I've also researched some of the 'Executive apartments' in the area like Quest, Quality etc, but a lot of their rates are starting at $600-700 and going higher than $1000 p/w. This is pretty far out of my budget, even if the apartments are serviced.

So, is there something I'm missing? Is there some great option for a self-contained property that won't break the bank? Is a rental property actually an option and I'm not looking at it the right way? Have you done this before/do you know anyone that's had to do this?

Any help at all is greatly appreciated, cheers guys."

Learning was never too difficult for me as long as I put in a alright amount of effort. My close friends always saw me as intelligent and as a guy who had his shit together. Due to financial issues I went to community college for a major in STEM. I always enjoyed science and learning. I also always enjoyed novels and stories. When I started college I became completely distracted by reading novels. I always felt that when I picked up a book I could not put it down, but it got worse. I did not do my homework or studying and started performing worse and worse. I ended up failing a couple classes because I did not study and kept wanting to read a few more chapters of a book. I tried to stop or control my desire, but I kept falling to the old habit. I lost track of the number of times I attempted and failed to curve my habit. Now I am not even sure if I can graduate from my major. My friends are doing well and are achieving their goals and I can't even build up enough will power to graduate from community college. What makes it even worse is that I come from a low income family. My mother slaved away trying support me and my sister. This drives me even crazier with guilt due to the sacrifices she made to give me the opportunities I had. I feel as if I am just weak and failure. I know what to do to achieve a long term financial stability and a better chance at happiness, but I falling to instant gratification. I had several opportunities and I squandered them. I had many chances, but I threw it all away. I am seen as a intelligent guy who is going to do fine in life, but it is all a sham. My friends are doing well in university, getting internships, and progressing in their careers and here I am. I lack self control. The desire to do even put the effort is going away. I don't trust myself. I am weak. I am going to keep trying to improve, but I feel as if I am stuck in a cycle of failure imposed by my lack of control. "

I am not sure I can deal with all the stress and I’ve thought a lot about quitting. 

Some background, I have a masters, did my student teaching and substituting as an intern, and last year I was half time teaching talented and gifted. This is my first full time job as a social studies teacher. I am teaching freshman civics.

I am constantly behind with my lesson planning and grading despite spending most of my free time working. My problem is I spend hours researching and developing lesson plans only to realize that for what ever reason the plan wouldn’t work in my classroom.

My students don’t respect me at all. I don’t like getting kids in trouble, and I think they have sensed that because they won’t be quiet for even a second to let me explain a fun activity for them. It feels as though every day is just a non stop sequence of putting out fires. I have talked to other teachers about strategies to prevent this but I am not sure I will be able to because I am not a natural disciplinarian. 

The stress has been impacting my health. I have been getting pretty bad headaches and my stomach is in knots 24/7. Because of this stress, I have lost over 10 pounds in about a month. I have had a few mild anxiety attacks when I’ve been lesson planning at home, during which I can’t do anything but lay on the floor. 

The thing that is keeping me going is the support from other teachers and administration. It is my first real teaching job so I don’t have anything to compare it to, but the other teachers have been overwhelmingly supportive. This has made me feel guilty, though, because I have a recurring thought that I would enjoy my job if it weren’t for the students, but as a teacher I am supposed to enjoy students. 

As I said above, I have been thinking about quitting. I am not sure I can provide a good educational environment for my students, because the stress and health issues have made me sluggish and I can’t react well enough in the classroom. My units have been a mess and I don’t think I have been a good teacher at all, and I feel guilty about failing my students.

I have been talking to a lot of people, and a common thing they have said is not to be so hard on my self and to focus on the students I am actually helping, but it hasn’t worked so far.

I am meeting with administration today and I am going to explain how the stress has affected my health. What I am hoping to get out of this post is another opinion on my situation."
9r9ieb,1,2018-10-25,[Job visa] Is it acceptable to offer to pay for my own immigration/moving costs?,rsheasby,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/9r9ieb/job_visa_is_it_acceptable_to_offer_to_pay_for_my/,"Hi all. So as I've said before I'm looking at immigrating to the states within the next 5 years or so. I'm applying for the lottery and all that but obviously I'm not relying on that as my plan. I'm almost done with my studies in software development and will be starting a career in it soon. I plan to save every bit of excess money to be able to move to the states should an opportunity arise. My question is whether or not it's acceptable to offer to a potential employer to pay for all my own immigration fees to increase my chances of getting hired? For example, if I got a Skype interview should I mention to them that I could pay them $5000 or so for all the legal fees on their side to offset their costs and make them more likely to offer the job? Should I offer to pay for my airfare and first month of living expenses as well? Would any of this constitute a bribe to be hired? Since they would be required to pay me more than they would a us citizen I think it would make them more likely to seriously consider me as I could offset my higher salary when I haven't proved myself yet in the first few months by a large once-off payment. Is any of this illegal or suspicious though? Would it be a red flag for the hiring company or for uscis? Note that I am legitimately a fairly above average developer. I just completed an internship with Microsoft South Africa and I the other students from my school all did significantly better than the other college educated students. I'm certain I could get a glowing reference from them. I.e. I am actually a good candidate, not just some idiot who wants to bribe his way to the top."
9ra6gd,3,2018-10-25,Help with credit score,millam26,povertyfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9ra6gd/help_with_credit_score/,"I’ve debated writing this out for a while now both as a means to clear my mind and maybe get some advice. 

I am 22 years old and living in an apartment in my college town with my brother as we are beginning to transition into being “adults”. I am finished with my school work and am working two retail jobs while waiting for an internship program I was accepted into to begin in the spring in another state. I work a lot and make a decent amount of money but my because my brother and I live together, and he is still in school my parents maintain that they have the responsibility of paying a lot of our bills. This sounds like a dream but honestly my parents and I don’t have the greatest relationship and I personally feel it is their way of keeping control of me as long as possible. I am by no means wealthy or bringing in a lot of income but I can pay for bills and I want to but I am not allowed. 

This leads me to my two credit cards. One of them is a Discover student card I opened as a freshman 4 years ago to begin building credit. It’s a 500$ limit card and was only used for gas and book purchases. My mom has primary control of the online logins and pays the monthly bill. We had issues in the past with the bill not getting paid so she has set up an automatic monthly payment from her account. Recently I have asked to pay and she will not give me the login information. My second card is the issue. As I was trying to figure out my internship position (needed to complete my degree) I was asked to travel out of state for an interview. While looking for flights I found an affordable round trip ticket and called my mom, who has experience booking flights for business, on how to book it and if it was a good deal. She pulled up the information and saw that if you signed up for an Allegiant card the and used it the price was significantly reduced. I could pay out of pocket for the full ticket fairly easy but she insisted that it was great to charge it to the card and then just immediately pay it off to save 75$ or so. Here’s the trouble. She talked about how the card could also be used for her and I to take a trip to see family and how it would be great to earn points for flying BUT we should put the card under my name. Her defense was it would build my credit even more and especially if I’m just going to put a small charge on it and then pay it off. No big deal we went for it, it was approved for 500$ and then she took the money from my account to pay for the ticket. 

So a few months later I get a notice on my credit karma saying my score has gone down. I open up my profile and my mom had completely maxed out the card. With out asking. I have never seen the card. Never received the information about it. And here it is sitting under my name complexly maxed out. My credit dropped 100 points almost instantly. Upset I called her and she told me it was just so she could buy our families vacation plane tickets and then she was going to pay it off the next week. 

Fast forward 3 more months into the present. The card has never been paid off my credit score has dropped in total from 668 to 445 and most recently it dropped 136 points because she has missed a payment. 

I’m fuming. I have been trying so hard to keep my credit up. I am about to move out of state. I need to get an apartment there, I need a new car. I am about to finally begin life on my own and I feel basically well... fucked... for lack of better word. Advice welcome. 

P.S. I love my mom and would literally die for her but she doesn’t make the best choices and I know that but please don’t not insult or attack her. What’s done is done I just need to know how to begin to fix it. 

Thank you and sorry for the long read. "

As the newest and unfortunately youngest person on the team, he has dedicated any form of bitch work to be my responsibility (because I was the intern so I already know how to do it), my regular role work, and the role of being his personal assistant when he can't handle doing things himself. He spends more time micromanaging things he asks me to do that aren't my job instead of just doing them himself and it is truly driving me up a wall. 

For example: today he spent 10 minutes complaining that I bolded a meeting's agenda items (because I always bold the ones day of so people realize what they're looking at) and telling me exactly what he wants on there (needing to re-word and rewrite everything three times) instead of just opening the document and doing it himself and saving us all the energy.

It truly bewilders me how someone could be so unaware of how much time and money they are wasting doing shit like this. Yes it's just 10 minutes of my morning, but add on the 10-30 minutes in the afternoon, x5 days a week, that really adds up to be a huge waste for everyone. 

The cherry on top - I finally worked up the courage after 5 months under him to bring it up yesterday during a 1:1. I decided to play it nice and say it has been a problem generally with people (not just him because I didn't think coming at my boss would be a good idea), and he said that's not cool for people to do they should have more respect for your time and work and BAM this morning 9am doing the same garbage.

Do I learn to suck it up until I hit my 1-year mark (as it is my first FT job out of college), or try to leave sooner? Or do I just develop a drinking problem?"

So I had a summer research internship in the summer of 2017 that carried over into fall 2017 while I finished up some analyses (the fall portion was unpaid, I was just invested in the work). Throughout the 2017 school year, I was working on writing up a manuscript about this research for my senior thesis, and completed that by the end of the school year (and also presented the data multiple times). 

Now we want to publish, but we have (at least) one more analysis to run and it's also going to be pretty much an entire reworking of my manuscript. I graduated school and left the city that the internship was in in June. We emailed a bit throughout the summer trying to figure out how to run the analysis in R, but it fizzled out (he was the last to reply, and I haven't yet, but we were both busy and I think that was understood). 

So anyway, here we are. At this point I'm not even sure I want to continue with this publication, just because I am fresh out of undergrad and think I might need quite a bit of guidance from the PhDs to complete it successfully and I don't even live in the city anymore. On the other hand, it would be my second publication and the first that I saw through from start to finish, which is a really valuable chunk of experience to have as an undergrad. 

I know I should touch base with him either way, but unsure of what to do and what to say. I'm also applying for government jobs related to our work right now and I know they're going to contact him, so I want to make sure that I don't let things fizzle out the way that they have.

I'm dead set on starting a new life in Japan to live with my current Japanese girlfriend.

The plan is to start a new career in software development as I've worked in the IT Support role for 5 years. I've self-studied at home developing projects that I can showcase to the agency if I need to. 

I've looked through a few online internships such as:
https://www.iccworld.co.jp/internshipinjapan/
https://www.theinterngroup.com/

But they provide these ""Program Fee's"" which ranges from 3 to 5 grand which I think is a bit much.

I'd be willing just to do an unpaid internship where I don't have to pay any fee's up front but even that seems minuscule. 

Am I looking in the wrong place? Has anyone actually been on one of these programs?

Will appreciate any answers you have, I welcome honest/frank feedback.

After 2 long years of sales internships while finishing college, I landed a sales role with a local technology company but wanted some advice if others have done similar roles.

I’ll be selling copiers and printers, IT Solutions and Telecom. Now when talking to my manager he recommended focusing on the copiers and printers side of the operation because “that’s where the money is”, but I’ve seen some negative feedback from some in this sub about printer and copier sales. 

I start the 2nd week of November after a brief training period at HC. My monthly goal is $30,000 revenue sales and a year end goal of $360,000. How do-able is this? I live in a decent market in Eastern Iowa and I’ll be given a set territory to conduct my sales.

Any and all advice about the job, tricks you may use, or certain avenues to explore would help so much thank you!! "
9rcxj8,2,2018-10-25,(M/21) Do I leave my girlfriend (F/21) of 5 years and move in with my best friend?,wheretogo102938,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9rcxj8/m21_do_i_leave_my_girlfriend_f21_of_5_years_and/,"First off, I’m sorry if this is long winded. I’ll include a TL;DR down below if anyone’s interested. Second, I’m posting from mobile, so I’m sorry if it’s not super easy to follow.

Some basic background info:

1. I have severe ADD. I was on medication for a year for it, and it helped, but made me feel like a zombie and I haven’t taken it for six years. I also have another problem, which is lying to cover my own ass in stressful situations. I don’t know why I do it. I am not proud of it at all. I’ve just always struggled with telling the truth. It’s a recurring issue between my girlfriend and I, and is essentially the main problem as to why I’m posting this here.

2. My girlfriend, who we’ll call Abby, has diagnosed C-PTSD and anxiety stemming from abuse (sexual, mental, emotional, physical, you name it...) she’s been one of my best friends since we were in 8th grade. And we’ve been off and on dating since 9th grade. I was really good at helping her with her anxiety and get her out of the bad places in her mind when she was having flashbacks. She has a service dog who is a godsend, and had a therapist who was a rock for her, up until he passed away recently.

3. My best friend, who we’ll call Matt, is like a brother to me. We were inseparable as high schoolers and we did everything. He still is my best friend, and we talk all the time.

So. Here we go.

I’m not gonna get into details about high school. All you need to know is that I struggled a lot in school because of my ADD, and it ended up costing me my chance to go into the Military. Something I had always wanted to do. I lied about my grades to my family and my girlfriend. And I wouldn’t have graduated if it weren’t for Abby and some helpful teachers. She was very helpful. And we were doing okay. I was stupid and left her for a month to be with another girl, which was a bad idea, I was frustrated with her constant “nagging” on my grades and other things. I was really dumb. But we got back together. We took each other’s virginity. We hung out almost everyday. Things were good.

After we graduated from High School together, she moved down to some islands to follow her dreams which, by the way, are very location specific. That being said, I was young and she was everything to me, so I told her I was going to move down and be with her once I saved up some money and could afford to move. I didn’t have any life plans. My goals of being in the military had been crushed. And I was working a pretty dead end job. So nine months later, I saved up a bunch of money and moved down to these islands to be with Abby. My best friend Matt helped me move down. It was pretty bittersweet to leave. I left my family, my small home town, my best friend, and everything I had once known.

I move down, and we had originally planned for me to get my own place. But as we found out, the cost of living in this place is RIDICULOUS. I searched for months to find a place of my own before I moved, and couldn’t find anything I’d be able to afford. So we just ended up moving in together and splitting rent. Previously, I had talked to her mother about proposing to her when I got down here. I couldn’t afford a ring, and I decided to just see how everything went, as we had just moved in together and we were learning how to live with each other. I was learning how not to be a slob and be responsible, she was learning how to let someone into her safe space.

Over the course of the next year, we fought, I lied about stupid things and made her sad, and I slowly started to get worse and worse with her anxiety. One thing that happens when she’s having an anxiety attack is she gets loud and mean. I used to be able to handle it and take a breath. She used to never really direct it towards me. But after living together, I started causing her more and more stress and some of it was beginning to be directed at me. I didn’t like this and I’ve been really struggling with it. I made some of her anxiety worse now. I caused some of it. And I didn’t know what to do. 

We work through it and I still struggle with it to this day. It’s been the source of many of our fights over the last few years. I just can’t handle it like I used to. 

We split up last summer, and I went back home for two weeks. In that two week period, I had asked her if we could take it easy and talk more when I got back. She agreed. I went back home, and I met a girl who I flirted with a little bit. Up until this point, Abby had been the only person I had truly been with. Emotionally, sexually, etc. and to be flirted with by someone else was exciting for me. But I didn’t pursue it. My heart was still with Abby and I couldn’t bring myself to do anything with another person. 

When I returned, I found out she had gone on a few dates with a guy she met at work. Kissed him, went to his house once, etc. I confronted her about it, and told her I thought were going to take it easy and talk more when I got back. The gist of her response was, it was purely casual between her and this guy. She wasn’t seeking a relationship and had been very clear to him about what was going on. She justified it saying that we weren’t together. We fought for a few weeks on this. Still living together, as it’s still ridiculously expensive to live where we do, and neither one of us could afford for the other one to leave. It was pretty toxic. Fights, nights spent in our cars, etc.

She ended up sleeping with this guy, and came home that night crying. Saying he wasn’t me, that she missed me and loved me, she didn’t want to do it, etc. They stopped seeing each other for a while. Then a hurricane hit, and we had to evacuate. We grew closer during this time. She was still talking to this other guy, but we weren’t together, and they weren’t flirting, as proven by texts she showed me. But the fact that she had slept with him a month before was still killing me inside, and to this day it does still sting. 

We ended up talking and agreeing that we wanted to be together but she was scared to because of my lies to her. I agreed to really work on myself and try to prove to her that I could be better. And when we returned home after the hurricane had passed, we talked more, and worked together on rebuilding our relationship. We still weren’t together officially yet. She couldn’t do it yet. I got a new job as my last job was destroyed by the hurricane, and she got back to focusing on her dreams and doing internships. She had some pretty harsh things happen to her at one of her internships in the beginning of 2018, and it really put her in a dark place as far as moving forward goes. But she got a new internship and is still pushing for her dreams. 

So fast forward to May of this year, and we officially get back together. Things are going really well for the first few months. We’re talking more and figuring out how to be better people to each other. I’m being open and honest with her on how I feel. She’s learning to not over react and make me feel sad when she’s stressed or having anxiety. Everything is going well, up until the beginning of this month. We get into a fight, and it blows up, I tell her how I feel and she gets upset. She had a bad anxiety attack and said some really scary things. Saying she wanted to kill herself. Saying I made her feel like wanting to die. And I know she didn’t mean these things. It was her anxiety talking, but I got upset and I tried to calm her down, but she kept screaming at me to get away and I didn’t listen. Things like that have happened in the past, she’s said things like that before a long time ago, and we agreed to break up if it ever got to that point again because it’s not safe for her to feel that way. We tried to break up, but we couldn’t do it...

Just after that, my aunt passed away. So after talking to Abby, and kind of working it out, I flew back home for the funeral. I saw Matt again, and we hung out for a day. He just bought his first house, and he’s been with me through all of my fights with Abby. I had been telling him about them as they happened, and he’s usually one to give really good advice and he’s really helped me before when it comes to figuring out where to go. When I told him about Abby and I’s latest fight. He told me he had been preparing his spare room for me. So that if I needed to, I could live with him back home. 

As of today Abby and I set up kind of a last ditch effort to fix things up. A five minute rule. If we feel like the other person is being unreasonable, or we get too stressed in the moment, we can call a five minute rule. Where we both just take five minutes to think about the other person’s side of things, and how we are reacting. So far, we’ve been fairly successful with it and it’s helped. 

I also need to stress in this, that I don’t have any other friends besides Abby and Matt. I don’t see or hang out with anyone else, really. I work two jobs to stay afloat, my new job is leading to a career and I make decent money now, and if I keep with it and make the choice to stay, I can retire happily very young. But the cost of living is still so high. I have bad credit from medical bills that went to collections unfortunately, so I’m trying to rebuild that.

Basically, the only things that tie me to living here, is Abby, and my job. In the three years it’s been since I moved here, I haven’t made one single good friend. I don’t hang out with anyone, and lately, I’ve been really scared and feeling like I’m walking on eggshells to fix Abby and I. I love her so much, and I care about how she feels. And I know she feels the same. I’m not one to want to sleep with anybody else. I don’t find joy in that. But I’ve never slept with anyone else, or been with anyone else emotionally. And all I hear from people is that I’m young, and I need to go out and experience things. Which sounds great, but my situation doesn’t allow for that, and I don’t know if I’d be truly happy doing that. But what I do know is that I’m not happy now. I’m scared of my future and I’m scared to hurt Abby again because I don’t know what else to do. Moving in with Matt sounds really really good, because he’s like family, and I’d be back home with my actual family too. I’ve got plenty of job opportunities back home, and it’s where so many of my friends are. But I have Abby and a possibly career here. 

What if we work through this and we’re okay? What if I start my career and I live a good life here? I know what the past says about us, but I’m too scared to do anything else. I’m confused on what I should do. I’ve talked to my mother and Matt about it, and my mom just says she supports me in whatever I choose, and Matt says that we’ve gone through too much, and that I should move back home. That he thinks I’d be happier back home. But he says, selfishly, he misses his best friend and wants me there. But if I move, Abby won’t be able to afford to live here, and the pursuit of her dreams will be most likely destroyed and she may actually kill herself. If we break up, but I stay for my career, I won’t be able to find my own place (too expensive and I have a pitbull...) and she won’t be able to find a place either...

That’s been weighing on my mind a lot lately... I’m really confused, and really scared. I’ve got an interview Monday for a promotion which will bring in more money, which would make living here much easier financially. But I’m still scared. I really just don’t know what to do or where to go from here... sorry about this being so long winded. Any advice you guys have, please please give it. Feel free to be brutally honest. 



TL;DR: Girlfriend and I have been together off and on with a lot of issues since freshman year of high school. We’ve split up multiple times and she’s slept with another guy, she’s still the only person I’ve ever slept with. I moved thousands of miles after high school to be with her. We fight a lot. I miss my family and my best friend. But I have a career and possible future where I am. I have a lot of personal issues I need to fix, and they directly effect my relationship with my girlfriend, as do her personal issues to me. Do I wait it out and see if I can fix things again, so that maybe I can continue my career? Or do I move back home to everyone else I know and love, and find a new job, potentially destroying my girlfriend and her pursuit of her dreams?"
9rcz9k,47,2018-10-25,GF [29/F] wants to have kids ASAP. I [28/M] told her my reservations. We’re at an impasse. Long.,klaptrap44,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9rcz9k/gf_29f_wants_to_have_kids_asap_i_28m_told_her_my/,"Amanda and I have been together since college (6 years). We haven’t had things “easy” during our time together. Amanda went to university as a mature student and I was constantly in the library preparing for major exams. We were study buddies and turned that into a romantic relationship. Up front, I’ll admit that Amanda is much better looking than I am. She’s conventionally beautiful where as I… have a great personality. Amanda and I are, in many ways, opposites. I grew up in a very mild mannered upper-middle class family. She grew up in a rough-and-tumble neighborhood and isn’t afraid to stand-up to people. She’s tough and straight forward. I’m calm and reserved. We make a great team as she’s never one to shy away from getting what’s rightfully ours of standing up for something I wouldn’t, where as I am good at working with people and getting things to move forward.

On the whole we have a really great relationship. Amanda had to sacrifice a lot. I graduated at 22 but didn’t get into my chosen field for advanced education until a year later. We had to move a substantial distance from my family. Due to numerous problems, Amanda has gone NC with her family. She’s been getting therapy for a while. 

It’s been up-and-down the last couple of months. There was uncertainty around where we’d wind-up and a lot of question marks in our lives. Things are starting to clear, but we still have a move coming up and I am working atrociously long hours. We’ve found a way to make more time for each other and part of the concession is that I dedicate my free time to “us time” in a switched-off manner. 

However, we’ve been bickering. She attributes it to feeling unfulfilled. While it’s getting better…. I have some issues. When Amanda fights, it’s to win and she will do or say anything to be the first to hurt someone. She goes for the throat and won’t back down. She’ll then realize she’s been incredibly hurtful and makes a full, unreserved, apology but by that point what’s said is said. She’s good at hitting on very sensitive subjects and on more than a few occasions I’ve totally disconnected and just left. It’s learned from her childhood and something she needs to stop doing. She’s trying, but the last couple of weeks have been very tough. We’ve had a few fights where she’s hit below the proverbial belt and left quite the mark. 

A big thing we’re working on is intimacy. We didn’t prioritize sex for a long time, often we’d go 3 weeks without any intimacy. We’ve been building it in and being better about keeping that a priority. For her (and sorry if this is TMI) a condom is a mood killer. She’s on oral contraceptives, but I often like a back-up method. I just can’t deal with an accident right now. That often kills the mood for her. When I try and explain my position, it seems only make it worse. 

I know I’m 99% of the problem. I’ve walked so far down a path that I have to see it through. It’s complicated, long, and costly. She’s had to sacrifice a lot. We’ve recently been talking about getting engaged/kids and she’s ready now. She has watched friends get married, buy houses, have kids, while we’ve been sacrificing for years. We haven’t even really had a vacation together. We get by and pay off our debts slowly, but there isn’t a lot left over for fun. She wants to “settle” and I understand that, but we’ve been fighting a lot, we have issues around intimacy and don’t even have a place to call our own just yet. She’s made it clear that she wants a kid, that she’s always wanted a family and is pushing 30. She figures that we’ll manage to pay off all our debt one way or another and that she’s sacrificed for 5 years and that all she wants is a kid. She attributes our fighting to a lack of intimacy (which means not using condoms) and not having something she can truly look forward to. 

I always had things so well segmented in my mind and never saw complexity or messiness. Now that I’m the thick of it, I realize life isn’t nearly as neat and clean as we project it; and I’m really not sure what to do. On one hand, I feel like adding more to this situation will just further strain us, on the other hand, I love Amanda and know how much she’s sacrificed for me – basically her career ambitions are gone. I feel like having a kid right now would make the stress in our lives worse (I definitely want a family but would like to have a bit more before doing so) but I’m torn because I know how much she’s sacrificed. She studied to work in a specific field but never could do the internships that would be needed to land a job. Instead, she has worked at a grocery store chain for a number of years and now has an office role but for the first ~3 years was a floor associate. Definitely not the kind of work she trained for. 

I’m not sure how to make this better, or even what to say. I’m often so tired and reeling from insanity at work that I have trouble putting words together. I’d appreciate everyone’s perspective on this. 

Should we just have the kid even though we have nothing? I'm worried what adding a kid to this mix will do, but I also feel a tremendous amount of guilt. Her sacrifice has meant our debts were cut by a substantial amount.

 What can I do in addition/in lieu to make it up to her for a huge sacrifice? 

*EDIT: For sake of clarity: we have about $135K in debt at this moment. 

tl;dr GF feels unfulfilled and her desire is to have a kid. We're broke and I'm still working my way up. A kid now would strain our finances and destroy any intimacy we're trying to build. But, I feel tremendous guilt about her sacrifice for us. Not sure what to do.

I have been fortunate enough to receive an offer from Equinor as a reservoir engineering intern. Since this is my first petroleum engineering internship I am quite nervous about what to expect as an intern. I'm confident in my ability to learn new things quickly, but I do not know what to expect overall. 

From what I've gathered, I should definitely brush up on Excel along with learning how to write VBA macros. Other than Excel and VBA, should I be comfortable with machine learning and other areas regarding programming? Basically my big fear is going in and feeling like I don't measure up to what they might expect from an intern. I've heard of a previous intern (who was featured in Forbes 30 under 30) doing some complex projects regarding machine learning and developing models which I find quite intimidating. 

Any information, tips, and advice would be awesome!

Previous: Small company poorly funded with one customer, no other Mechanical Engineers to work with or get mentorship from, was still in charge of complete design and development of product (was very overwhelming at times).

&amp;#x200B;

Current: Unemployed, let go due to lack of work in September, however, boss contacted me about doing contract work to help if new projects come up. Accepted offer to Option 1.

Option 1: Medium sized well established company in the medical industry. Pros: Well organized and growing with a unique product, lots of grey beards, and many people with 10+ years of seniority at the company, positive feedback from engineers. Cons: bad reviews of upper management, Japanese bought company. Main concern: miss opportunity with option 2 (see below), not as enjoyable, wont have as big an impact.

Option 2:  New fast growing start up in the medical industry, research completed. Pros: possible huge positive impact on the world, very diverse group of highly educated people to talk and learn from, very admirable CEO, chance at making a lot if company does well, very well funded, growing fast. Cons: Not as much seniority in the mechanical engineering department. Main concern: lose out on possible mentorship.

Since getting out of college I was thrown into the fire at the small company having to learn a lot on my own and making many mistakes. With my next position I was really looking to get some good mentorship and at first accepted the offer for Option 1, however Option 2 made a strong case as to the good of the product, capabilities of the team, and possibilities for the future.

9rdy2v,7,2018-10-25,Trapped in bathroom by man in nightgown who blocked door.,whiteguysky-,creepyencounters,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/9rdy2v/trapped_in_bathroom_by_man_in_nightgown_who/,"

This summer I had an internship at a youth department of an inner city homeless shelter. Since most of the interns were college students, the shelter provided free room and board for us. In the previous years, the male interns shared a dorm like room at the men’s long term recovery program. A lot of these men would have to start in the short term shelter and apply to start the long term program. They would move into a newer nicer building. This is where they would stay for 9 months- 1 year. It was nice to hang out with the men after work. Most of them were very nice. We would watch movies or play pool. 

This summer was different. We had to stay in the new building which was intended for the mentally or physically handicapped homeless male. They all had a very regimented schedule like getting up at 5 am and going to bed by 9 pm. So I never had much interaction with them beyond passing. 

The men also couldn’t bring any clothes up to the third floor which is where the bed rooms were. They were only allowed to wear hospital night gowns. This made the place feel even more like a hospital. With only about 8 beds to a room, there was little privacy for the men. The opposite was true about my room. There was only one other male intern, who at the time was spending a couple weeks at our summer camp. So I had the entire room to myself. 

This was around midnight. I had just finished listening to an album about the mind of serial killer. But I had to pee, so I left my room and headed down the cold hallway. It was darkly lit and all the other rooms had their doors shut. 
So I get to the bathroom and enter a stall and start doing my business. While peeing, I was reading an article about the album I had just finished. 

After I’m done, I stand in the stall door way, door open, for about 2-3 minutes still reading the article. I glance up to see a man standing in front of the closed bathroom door. I remember his eyes being very very red. The man was around 5 foot 7 inches. He looked to be in his late 20s-early 30s. He was also wearing of the hospital night gowns. We made eye contact for an moment. 

“He locked his keys in the bathroom.” The man said with calm voice. 

I was confused. I didn’t know what the hell he meant. 

He repeated himself with slight aggression. 

Was he implying that we were locked in here together? He was standing in front of the door, almost blocking me. I knew this could go very wrong, very quickly. I tried to stay calm. 

“What?” I said. 

“Gary, he locked his keys in the bathroom.” He said. 

Gary was the over night security guard. This man must have felt the need to inform me of what happened with Gary’s keys. 

“Oh, uh, thank you.” I said and walked past him and opened the door. 

I quickly went to my room and made sure to the lock the door. My heart was pounding. I didn’t know what to think. Certainly listening to the album about the serial killer didn’t help. I just knew I needed to get the hell out of there.

9rfglh,0,2018-10-25,[Non EU] Interning in Estonia?,rafelix09,Eesti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eesti/comments/9rfglh/non_eu_interning_in_estonia/,"Hi :) I am a Latin American student studying Computer Science in UC Berkeley (US). I am not a EU citizen or a US citizen and I was thinking about working this summer in Europe to get a taste of how is working in tech over there. I have interned in Facebook two times before, so I was looking for a smaller place (where I can work in the main product) that could hopefully pay me enough so that I can cover my living expenses on Tallinn for three months (May-August) and so that I can travel to some countries of Eastern Europe (especially the ones that border with the Baltic Sea). How hard is to find paid internships in Estonia? Where should I look for these opportunities?"

9rftm0,0,2018-10-25,I (20M) have been treating my GF (21F) poorly for nearly a year - help me stop. Its killing her.,throwaway26072201,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9rftm0/i_20m_have_been_treating_my_gf_21f_poorly_for/,"This is going to be a long one, so please hold on!

&amp;#x200B;

I met my GF at university November 2017, and have been with her for almost 11 months now. She lives in a different country os of this past summer, but we make a concerted effort to see each other every two weeks, and for now the longest we have been apart is 4 weeks. And it was PAINFUL. She is my one and everything, I love her to bits, making her happy makes me happy and when I think of a future, it is always with her by my side forever. We have talked early on about wanting to marry (in like 4 years) and have kids together (in like 7 years), and we are very open with each other. We are completely honest all the time. And yet, I am treating her poorly, have been for a while, and its burning her out. Please help.

&amp;#x200B;

You will have to read through our story a bit, so here goes nothing:

I have a few very close friends from HS, of which half are guys and half are girls. Sometimes I felt like spending time with girls was better than with guys, and sometimes its just refreshing to have some girls in a friend group. I would say my four best friends from HS are two guys and two girls. I was into one of these girls for 1 week when she was new in sophomore year. Since I have only ever considered her a great friend. The other was my go-to gossip pal, we would gossip about things for hours and it was fun, even though in retrospect it is nothing I am proud of. Also in the wider friend group there is a further girl who I had a crush on in MS for a a few months (maybe 6 or 7 months), I'd say when we were both 13/14.

I have been in a relationship with on girl previously in freshman year for a total of about 10 months. Also, I was pursuing a girl, for reference call her Jane, in the summer between junior and senior year, but Jane ended up choosing one of my best friends (M) instead. He dated her all through senior year and partly into university. So obviously Jane still spent time around me, and we were cordial to each other. We recognised that dating wouldn't work out (though secretly I was pissed that she chose my friend over me), and then over time we went from cordial to friendly. I would say Jane and I were loose friends by the time I went to university.

Going into university I was a virgin and that was something I was kind of uneasy about. Going out with alcohol (yeah in Europe) gave me the chance to lower my inhibitions, gain ""experience"" and I hoped I might overcome that uneasiness. So it became a thing for me that I would go out with the goal of hooking up with a stranger girl in the club. That was fun to me, and I always made it a thing that I couldn't go out if I was not very drunk, knowing that the lowered inhibitions made it more ""fun"" for me. 

My friends and I all went on a trip, that Jane came along on, and her and I became kind of friends on that trip. And she was going to uni now too, so we agreed we should chat more, and we called once in October 2017.

I met my GF going out too, but this was different, because this time she was going out with my friend group. We had mutual friends. We talked a BUNCH and got pretty drunk together. We had our ""first date"" soon after, and the following week we spent as much time as possible together. When winter break came around, we had been dating for just more than a week, and of course to limit the time apart I invited her to my house for a week and introduced her to my parents. 

After winter break the relationship with my GF really took off, and by the end of January we were already talking about how we were imagining spending the rest of our lives together. Jane texted me a happy birthday in January, and I replied, suggesting a call to catch up since we hadn't talked since October 2017. She declined, saying she didn't have much time to call, but texting would work out, so over a span of two days we texted semi-often and I gave her updates about my uni work, and that I was dating a girl now, and she told me about uni stuff to. I never really mentioned this to my girlfriend until it came up in August 2018, and my GF is convinced I was then already clearly attempting to keep my options open, obviously not committed to her. 

To understand her point of view here are a few other things I did to her between February 2018 and July 2018:

1. When I went out with friends from uni, I didn't invite her to a pre-party, and only met her in the club later, where I briefly introduced my uni friends. Throughout the night (I drank too much, I only know this happened because my GF told me, and her friend backed up the stories) I seemed to be on my way out of the club with two female friends from uni, I was grinding with these girls as well, and I seemed to have totally been ignoring my GF that night.
2. On a different occasion, my GF and I went out with a girl that didn't really know anyone in the group, and so I was pretty drunk, and tried to be very nice to her. At the time I was honestly just trying to be nice, but in retrospect it totally came across as flirting: I bought the new girl more drinks than my GF, and I denied my GF alcohol in favour of the new girl (my rationale at that point was the new girl was not drunk enough to have fun herself....)
3. Another different time when I was very drunk, and my HS best friend was visiting, him and I and my GF and his new GF went drinking, I got very drunk and I (I don't remember I only know because my GF told me) said one of my female best friends from HS was hot (we had all done saunas together as a friend group).
4. Another time my other best female friend from HS came to visit. She came to meet my GF, and the first hour at lunch she made some lowkey mean comments towards my GF, that I didn't realise at the time, but now totally recognise I should have intervened. Also I spent a lot of the lunch time gossiping with my best friend while leaving out mf GF without really realising it. This pissed off my GF, and she didn't want to spend the rest of the afternoon with us, and so my best friend and I went to my room alone and just continued catching up, talking about our HS and gossiping. My GF organised a little get-together that my best friend and I arrived 15 minutes late to (we had three hours to prepare....) and moreover, while I was convinced that my GF was just really mad at me, I tried to avoid her so as not to make things worse. This went on for the drinking part of the evening too, and in the end I poured drinks for my best friend and didn't offer my GF any, and generally made her feel left out. This crushed my GF.
5. Also, I went to a party without my GF once (that was planned, just didn't work out for us to go together), and at the party, I met a girl that I was basically ""fan-girling"" a random band with. For me it was really honestly just for the laughs and it was a fun time, but obviously it totally seemed like I was flirting with the girl I met at the party. And after the band left the girl asked if we should get drinks at which point I realised I was sending the wrong signals, said no and she disappeared. I told my GF later that night that I had been ""fan-girling"" with a random girl and it was just for laughs, but I don't think I never mentioned the girl asking me for drinks. That came up recently when we were talking about things, and she found photos from the party of me and her laughing and singing at the band which obviously made her very hurt. It looked again like I was keeping my options open, and that my GF is not good enough for me. Of course that is not what I intended to have happen, but I really see now that my actions then were careless. It is so much easier to realise this in retrospect when the SO is crying to you about it...
6. I liked an instagram photo of Jane in June 2018 after not having talked to Jane at all since January, and my GF saw that as my trying to keep contact alive with Jane, who she thinks is much prettier than her, and she thinks I am still into. I realise that liking an ex-romantic interest's picture is dumb, and I don't know what made me feel like it was the right thing to do, but I never really considered her an ex-romantic interest since I got over her choosing my friend over me. At one point it was his GF then, and nothing I was interested in.
7. I went home for a weekend for a big party that I invited my GF to attend. I no longer have an own apartment in that city, so I needed a place for us both to stay, and the only feasible person I could ask (and who had offered to host me before, as our family are friends) was the house of the friend I had a crush on when 13/14. I didn't realise the implications of telling my GF that I was suggesting we crash there, and that made her uncomfortable. In addition, she didn't want to feel left out being only her amongst all these HS friends, many of whom she didn't know. Yet I was very convinced that I wanted to go to the party, and though she said she wasn't too interested, I said I wanted to go anyway, and that made her feel like I didn't care about her feelings. Also it made her feel like I was trying to find a way to sleep with this girl behind my GF's back. Talking this over in retrospect my GF says we should have taken a hotel room. And though that prospect seemed horrid for me in my ""home town"", I see now that that would have been much better for her. In retrospect it is just much easier to see how I should have acted better.
8. When I went on the weekend trip home without her, I didn't text her that much, because i didn't get wifi, and I had no 3G either. I'm too cheap to buy it all the time (I have prepaid...) I did call her Saturday and Sunday night after going out, but she felt like I was trying to avoid her throughout the days.
9. On this same trip I met with the one best female friend from HS that I had previously called hot, and I only told her a few hours before it was going to happen. I had forgotten to tell her this, and she felt like that was me going behind her back.
10. I once called this same best female friend when back at university for a 3/4 hour. Wanting to be 100% transparent with my GF I said I was fine to have my GF in the room during the call, but it just made my GF feel left out when I was laughing about things with my best female friend from HS. And my GF saw me asking my best friend about that best friend's dating life as me being interested in when I can get into my best friend's pants.
11. When my GF asks me if there's anything I don't like about my two female best friends from HS, about Jane or about female friends from university, I can only ever think of minor small things (One girl is too organised and thats makes me uncomfortable). 
12. My GF feels like I reminisce about previous girls (my ex-GF in freshman, Jane or best female friend I was into for a week) too much and it makes it seem like my GF isn't good enough for me, and that I am not putting my GF infront of other girls in my life.
13. I planned a call with my best female friend that I was into for a week without telling my GF, even though I knew she wouldn't feel super comfortable knowing it. In the moment, I was just pushing the confrontation away from me, and it was hard for me to actually man up and tell her. And when she asked me about it instead, only then I told her after she asked a few times, because I felt like I had dug myself a hole and it was going downhill and in the end she feels like I will only ever tell her things if she finds out about them, and that I'm hiding much more from her.
14. I have on two occasions slept in the same room as this best friend before I met my GF. Once in a double bed after a house party (no sexual things, nothing of the sort) and once for a week in bunk beds in a two-bed hostel room. Also I invited her to my house once when my parents were not there in senior year where she slept in the guest-room (I even made the guest bedroom bed). My GF adds this and what I have said about this one female best friend together to conclude that I'm keeping the girl around so I can get into her pants, and that my GF is actually just a convenience for me.
15. I went to a pre-party party with a female friends and a guy-friend at uni that I didn't invite her to (because I wasn't sure if it was ok for me to), while she was looking for a pre-party and we only planned to meet later in the club, which made her feel like I was hiding part of my life from her.
16. I was once in a pub with friends (3M, 2F and me) at uni and we played pub games where I ended up on the girl's team, as well as there being a picture of me sitting on the side of the table the girls were on across from the guys. Also my GF and I had previously talked about how poorly she felt about me treating her, and still I chose to spend 15 minutes walking my female friend at uni to her place before going to my GF's. Just another example for when I do not have my priorities straight.

&amp;#x200B;

I am probably forgetting more things. In short, I did a tonne of things ranging from minor to major that all add up to me disrespecting our relationship, making my GF feel like she is second to other girls, and that I only keep her around for convenience. She talked to me about how my actions make her feel, and while I tell her I want to improve and do better, I always add to the list instead of doing better. Its making her feel like she isn't good enough, and its taking a real toll on her confidence in her body and her personality, constantly questioning ""why am I not good enough for him, why does he always do this to me"". I realise that many things I do are disrespectful and careless in retrospect, but in the moment, I never realise how dumb they are. I am just in social moments (or very drunk) and I do not think about how the things I do will affect her. During the summer I did a little better, though it is mainly because I didn't have much chance to do poorly. I did an internship in a foreign city all summer, and most social contact I had was her and my family. Still there were one or two occasions where I forgot to tell her impactful things. Basically even when there isn't much to fuck up, I still manage to.

Now I am back at uni, but she is elsewhere, and though I promised I would do better, the first time I went out, mid-way through I stopped texting her, and only did so twice, and never let her know when I was home safe, mostly because I was too drunk. Her knowing that when I am drunk I can do evil things for our relationship that I do not remember, I realise that this made her feel terrible. To make it worse, I didn't at least tell her when I was home fine, and so she thought I was in bed with a club hookup or similar. And in the morning, in the midst of my hangover and rushing to lectures, I didn't get the chance to tell her much about the previous night and overlook when she asked about the night. For her it clearly looked like I was trying to hide stuff. Which I totally understand. I was just not thinking straight, and it made her realise that I would just be the same again. And with her not being with me at all times, she couldn't help but worry I would do more bad things, talk to girls, hookup or worse, and she would never be the wiser.

I said I would do my best to involve her in my life, but it has been much more of me telling her what I would do, and less her actually being involved in decisions. So when I told her I would be attending a female friend's bday drinks without much else (because that was all I knew then), she saw it as me being too careless to consider how these things would affect her. Because this was a further girl I would just want to grind on drunkenly, and spend time with, hiding it from her.

When I visited a friend of mine on the weekend, I went out with him twice. Once I was only moderately drunk, and gave her constant updates. I also told her that there were a group of girls that I thought were interested in me, but that they would have no chance because I had her. It was poorly worded on my part and I was really just very uncomfortable in the situation, but she saw this as a continuation of all the stuff that I had done previously, and that I was really just dangling in front of her that I had many chances beyond her, and that I didn't really need her around. The other time I went out, I got more drunk, and drunk texted her, though nothing about girls. Still I forgot to tell her I was home safe as I had promised to do, and so in the end it was just more disappointments. Now she dreads every time I go out (and it has only been approx. once a week). I have a lot of work to do, and she says the only reason I am not going out more to ""grind on girls drunkenly"" is because I am too busy.

&amp;#x200B;

I have deeply hurt her and wrecked her self-confidence. There is no way in the world that she feels like she can trust me again, and she just feels reminded that I don't actually want her when we talk. She is regularly crying herself to sleep, and she is at the point where she wants to try to make me feel as bad as she does by doing what I have been doing to her, to me. It must be said she has really conducted herself amazingly! She has cut out basically all guy friends from her life, and she says guy friends used to be her best friends (though sometimes she says guys can never be friends with girls, because one always falls for the other, and she can say that out of experience...). Still, she has never given me reason to mistrust her (1005 never ever, even if I were a cynic), and I am 100% convinced that she is in love with me. In fact with all I have done to her, this champion of a woman still wants to stay with me because she is deeply in love. She even says she feels weak because she cannot leave me eventhough it would maybe be better for her sanity to do so at the moment. And even though any other person would have left me by now, I am soooo happy she hasn't, and I never want her too. And yet I always find new ways to fuck up... :( 

She just wants me to include her in my life, and show that I care about her feelings. And show that I put her first. Yet all my actions indicate that I don't care enough to actually do something about all of this.  


There are a few problems I identify in myself atm, however there are probably more, and I really need help changing my actions:  
1. I am chronically forgetful (undiagnosed). I am constantly forgetting to tell her things. At the beginning of our relationship it was much worse, as I had some weekend trips planned for example that I would only remember to tell her a week or so in advance a la ""Oh did I ever tell you I was going to city X to visit a friend (M) of mine?"". This has gotten better, but still I catch myself forgetting to have told her minor things or details of events that are probably relevant. This is especially bad as we are in a long distance relationship now, and thus it is critical to ensure the SO is involved in the other's life. Also it means I forget about things we have talked about. Mostly smaller things, but things that matter. If I do not remember an event 100%, and I fill in small gaps, she will pick up on it when we talk about it again three weeks later as proof that I'm hiding something.  
2. I am ignorant in social settings, particularly regarding her feelings. I just do not realise or think about how my actions will hurt her. I am convinced that I have friends that are girls, and thats that, and yet on some occasions I prove that I cannot find the line between being friendly to a girl and flirting with a girl with sexual intent.

3. I overpromise things. I tell her I want to change, also because of course I want to, but I never manage. Maybe its because I am a master-procrastinator? Maybe its because I don't care enough? But I am convinced that she is my one and only. And I cannot ever imagine me and her not being together. I only want this to work out.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I do this?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I have been a shit to my GF (never cheating, but close enough, at least read some of the 16 examples in the middle), and she is fed up. I promise change but never achieve it. She's holding on in spite of her mental health because she loves me too much and ""can't physically leave"" me. Why am I like this. Help me stop."
9rg2ke,8,2018-10-25,Almost 1yr Old; Still Having Accidents,bopeep_24,Dogtraining,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/9rg2ke/almost_1yr_old_still_having_accidents/,"I own a 11 month, neutered Golden Retriever/Aussie Mix.  He weighs almost 60lbs, and I'm still dealing with potty accidents.  I'm not sure why.  I take him out regularly - once in the morning before work, once at lunch, once when I get home, and once before bed.  A lot of times, there is another potty break between coming home from work and bed time.  So he is NEVER going more than four to five hours at a time before I am taking him out.

But I am getting frustrated, I cannot lie.  Just tonight - I took him out at lunch (1pm), again when I got home from an appointment after work (5ish).  At 7:10pm he unleashed this river of piss I have no idea where it came from.  I just want to cry.  He was having accidents still before my boyfriend left for his internship and I REALLY wanted to show that I trained him completely by the time he got back - but this?  And it's a few times a week.  I've tried anticipating it by taking him out at the time the accidents tend to happen, but obviously I haven't been always successful.

He has been to the vet so much, and they have nothing for me.  No health reason is causing this.  They said he might be peeing inside only when I'm home because I'm the ""nicer"" one of the boyfriend and I.  I don't understand how I can train him if when I get home for the night he is only making it two or three hours in between potty breaks.  I'd expect that for a four month old puppy but for an 11 month old one?  Am I missing something?  He is also still a squatter pee-er so I considered the idea that he is marking, but there is never anything new smelling in the house when it happens.

Could it be because we have another dog?  Even though the other dog was here long before him?  Like he's trying to show her what's his?  I am clueless and am on the verge of tears.  What am I doing wrong?"

9rhe3w,110,2018-10-25,I feel like I'm losing my grip,hydroxyapatite-er,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/9rhe3w/i_feel_like_im_losing_my_grip/," 

It feels like there's a post like this every week now and I'm so sorry to add to that. Throwaway because I'm terrified of anyone finding out. I'm an EM Intern.

I feel like I'm slowly fading away. I alternate between periods of extreme apathy and severe depression. I'm not actively suicidal, but I could probably die tomorrow and not be too bothered by it. I've cried every night this week coming home from work, and today I broke down at the gym, which is usually my happy de-stress place. I feel like I'm not safe anywhere from this stupid brain of mine.

It's not even that I dislike my residency program. I actually really like it. But I feel so incompetent, and like I don't know anything about medicine and I feel like I'm way behind my peers. But then I sit down to study and get even more stressed out. I become fixated on my mistakes and replay them over and over again. I chug caffeine to keep me awake, and then down melatonin at night to help me fall asleep. I'm just so tired.

I'm at a residency in the middle of nowhere, far far away from all of my friends and family, with plane tickets being too expensive to go home and a schedule that doesn't allow for frequent trips anyway. I have a long distance boyfriend who is also an intern and he has his own set of problems. As such we haven't been talking. I feel so isolated. I feel like I'm drowning.

I have friends here. I have people I really care about, that I think could truly become my family in time. But right now I just feel broken inside. I can't see it getting better. I'm scared because I've never felt like this in my life and I don't know what to do. I don't know how to approach my program leadership because I don't want to get in trouble or my training to get messed up. I dont even know how to go about finding a therapist, and even if I did, I can't imagine it will be cheap. I just needed to tell this to someone. I haven't been able to verbalize any of this. But I need help, and I just can't seem to say it out loud.

Update: I did it guys (sort of). I emailed my faculty mentor who is also part of program leadership. Its terrifying but you guys have made me feel hopeful for the first time in a while. Im off tomorrow so I'm gonna lift and netflix and get a massage and start looking for in-network psych and FM options. I'm tired of feeling like this and you guys reminded me that I dont have to. Thanks for being such an amazing community. I've been reduced to (happy) tears many times by all of your kind words and advice. My heart aches for the number of people who have said they feel the same. This is terrible and you all deserve better than this. Please dont hesitate to reach out if you also need to vent. "
9rhu9v,1,2018-10-26,Depression Help,InJanus1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9rhu9v/depression_help/,"Hello all,

I just wanted to get a few things out.

These past few weeks has been really rough for me. Exams left and right, letting friends down, and having nobody to talk to. All of this has been getting to my head and i have been feeling worse than ever. Things are in my favor though like good(ish) grades for engineering and getting a internship with a very good company. Spite this, everyone is still a lot more happier than me. This makes me angry and upset that i have a lot of things going well for me in my life but its still not enough.

I have had some problems with depression before and have had my incidents of self harm as well. I have been almost as far as jumping off a building. 

Every day I try to think about something to live for. This simple task is getting harder and harder every morning. Also when I go help one of my friends, I let them down or a joke goes too far and they wont talk to me anymore.

I feel like I pushed myself out of everything. 

I'm trying to find my peace of mind again where I am not scared of myself anymore. Where I can be myself and not get punished for it."

9ridau,26,2018-10-26,Does it bother you when people ask for money for mission trips?,agomezwe,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/9ridau/does_it_bother_you_when_people_ask_for_money_for/,"Hello! I used to be an active part of the church, and campus ministries when I was in school. Now, I've left that all behind and I'm not really ""out"" about my faith. I receive requests for funding mission trips. For two I received, I can't say I was close friends with either, but I was in bible study groups with them and hadn't talked to them since I left school. 

One girl reached out to me today. I knew immediately what she was talking to me for, because she never bothered to talk to me before that. She's going on a mission trip to Japan where she will be ministering through singing. I was annoyed immediately, because she was all ""How are you?"" and all that when she hadn't talked to me since the last time she asked for money. 

Another girl I spoke with, I gave money to for being a campus intern for the organization I was a part of. She was supposed to raise about $40K I believe, but since she didn't make her goal by their deadline, they decided the ministry wasn't a ""fit"" for her anymore- which broke my heart for her and soured my opinion of the org. Luckily she found a job as a teacher not too long after. 

Even when I was active in my faith, I had a huge issue with funding mission trips. I come from a low-income background, so I simply didn't have the help, or know enough people with money to even consider such a thing. I've been on short trips and hated every minute of them. We didn't make much of a difference and I felt that a lot of times they were just vacations. And a lot of the kids I knew who went on these came from pretty well-off families. 

Does this bother anyone? I'm trying to learn how to politely say no to people. "
9rif8q,10,2018-10-26,My experience of Modalert in the first week,PoorformanceReview,afinil,https://www.reddit.com/r/afinil/comments/9rif8q/my_experience_of_modalert_in_the_first_week/,"So today officially marks a week since I first dosed up on Moda and I've been taking 200mg every other day with a nootropic stack called Vi-Brain on the offdays.

I have to say I'm feeling great, not just with regards to being able to focus on work but also feeling way more comfortable and happier.

Maybe I've got a slightly weaker batch but my moda seems to last around 10 hours which is perfect for me since it lasts my entire workday and let's me relax when I get home. On the offdays the Vi-Brain nootropic stack helps alot in motivating me and carrying me through the day, it gives me a better feelgood vibe than moda. Wondering if I should take them both in a day to see what would happen.

Anyways, my mind is like a laser but more like an all encompassing laser. I can focus on multiple things at once which is perfect since I manage a few associates and interns and am constantly dealing with clients and fellow managers.

Any tips on how to benefit more from the moda?"
9rifb6,4,2018-10-26,Going solo traveling again this year and making it my sixth solo travel adventure and reflecting on my first ever international trip from almost four years ago up until now.,natonio95,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/9rifb6/going_solo_traveling_again_this_year_and_making/,"Typing on my phone, so may be some errors.

I’m currently saving up to return to France again this December for a month and spending nine nights in Berlin to celebrate New Years Eve for the third time lol. I’ve liked how much I’ve grown as a person through my travels. Such as learning how to budget, have situational awareness with my surroundings and managing to meet new people, which is something I still sometimes struggle with here in my home city of Fresno.

I feel like a different person whenever I decide to travel alone, my instincts change when I realize I have to rely on myself to have fun!! When I first went to Germany as my first trip outside of the United States, I would be lying to myself if I said I wasn’t scared. I was intimidated a bit by the fact that I won’t have to rely on my parents to help me pay for my food or souvenirs like they always have when we travel together.

Ever since that trip, I don’t give that intimidation a second thought and embrace having to get to experience new cultures that some of my friends envy me for. One of my friends with bigger ambitions of becoming a doctor, told me she was inspired by my travels to Germany, France,  and Montreal, Canada that she decided to take a 6 week internship in China to help boost her profile to become a doctor. I never thought I’d be that influential to others and even to people that deemed more ambitious than I am. 

My travels have made me less materialistic to where I don’t want to get a new smartphone constantly, not buy new video games all the time, or spend hundreds of dollars on clothes that I’ll only wear two or three times and throw i
back into my drawer. Now whenever I want a new phone that costs $700, I just say to myself “I rather spend that much on a round trip ticket from SFO to Spain” (don’t quote me on that, just making a point).

From meeting new people, I never thought I had the ability to meet many new people in a short amount of time. Maybe because the alcohol from the hostel bar helps, but it’s nice knowing that at a hostel, the mindset is similar and we just all want to make new friends. I still keep in contact with these three French guys I met in Berlin four years ago and I am hopefully going to be meeting up with one of them in Paris when I land in the city on the 17th of December. They were influential in my one week in Berlin which I will never forget. They took me to an underground club called Tresor which introduced me to techno and underground electronic music and because of that specific moment, I’ve been delving into the techno scene and meeting artists that have influenced me and traveled alone to Detroit, Michigan this year for Movement Festival that celebrates the creation of techno in the city before it was brought to Berlin and became popular over Europe. Those amazing parties and raves I’ve attended throughout my travels has inspired me to take an Audio Engineering class that has made me interested in making mixing and mastering music tracks into a career! I'm in the beginning stages so far, but I love how more interesting this class has become.

For anyone curious about my travels (in chronological order) they are:

Germany, North Carolina/Orlando, Florida, Montreal, Berlin for a week and then France for a week and a half, The Netherlands, Detroit, Michigan for Movement Festival, and then my upcoming month long trip to France and a third return to Berlin. 

There have been smaller trips between these big trips and those small ones are usually around California going to San Francisco, Yosemite and Sequoia National Park, Los Angeles, and to the coastline. 

But the bigger trips are the ones I recognized the most only because I paid for each of those trips and I solo traveled for all of them with the exception of the North Carolina/Orlando, Florida trip as my mom paid for the trip for our family after getting lucky on a lottery ticket lol. 


Anyways, there is way more stories for each of these trips that helped me as a person. I’ll write them once I get to my laptop.


edit:

When I went to Montreal, it was my second big international trip and it was to meet two of the three French guys I met in Berlin and it was so nice to see both of them again in a different country! Even got to meet their peers they hung out with back in their home city of Grenoble, France. They even taught me how to smoke like they do and now I tell my other friends that French people taught me how to smoke lol. Then after that trip, I bought a ticket with the left over money and decided to go to Berlin for the second time for New Years Eve and then head to France for the first time!

I am so easily influenced by Berlin and the French because those two have been more influential to my personality than anyone else had ever since I graduated high school in 2013. It's reflected in my music tastes (Berlin techno), how I treat others (compassion and humanitarianism that I learned from my French peers), and what places I travel to (""Where are the techno parties at?"" ""What venues in this city has techno or underground electronic music"")

My travels isn't always perfect. I met these group of Dutch people during my second travel to Berlin at the same hostel I stayed at previously. There was big group of them of about 16 and they were celebrating New Years Eve in the city as I was and they invited me along with their group. I was still a  bit socially awkward even with all the travels and so they were honest about it whenever we had dinner together. I had an amazing New Years with them that it rivaled my last New Years experience in Berlin. Our group went to a randome neighborhood to go to the rooftops to watch the fireworks go off at 12am (though they were already exploding before midnight) and then we went to Griessmuehle as they were hosting a 28 hour NYE rave. Unfortunately, the line was to big so half of the group including me went to one of their friend's flat and had a big party lasting until 8am then went back to  Griessmuehle the next night to finish the crazy adventure. i only stayed for an hour at the venue before heading off as my flight to Paris the next morning was leaving at 7am. 

I thought we had great time together and so it influenced my decision to go to The Netherlands and celebrate New Years Eve in Amsterdam! However, when I booked my ticket and told them I was coming to their homeland, none of them replied to my message and left me on read. I thought that was really weird and two days before the trip, none of them decided they wanted to attempt to meet up with me. I felt a bit hurt when they decided to act that way, but I quickly got over it when I knew I was going to experience a whole new culture and meet new people!! 

Their response is a contrast compared to my French peers. When I told them I was going to be in France for a month, they responded with excitement and offered me places to stay and to hang out when I come. I now realize which country I like better hahaha. Moral of this story for myself is you may meet new friends at hostel, but don't set your expectations too high, everyone is just visiting for a short moment!

Anyways, that's my crazy story of my traveling life. I'm 23 years old and I want to say I'm proud of what I've done since graduating high school. It's not akin to getting a great career after college, but most people would envy what I've done with my travels, which is saying something of my choices.

9rjbkj,0,2018-10-26,Is getting a small personal loan to pay some expenses and get me through the next month a terrible idea?,Bob-Harris,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9rjbkj/is_getting_a_small_personal_loan_to_pay_some/,"Ok, a bit of backstory here. I am a 25 year old male, no kids, no mortgage. 

I graduated college in 2016 and from then until May 2018 I was working freelance as a cameraman. Things were ok, so good months and more often than not, some bad ones. Back in January I decided to start actively looking for a full time position in the same role.

I interviewed for a few places and wasn't having any luck as not many places hire just camera people, they usually want you to edit and wear multiple hats etc. The day after I got rejected from a job I really wanted, I got a message out of the blue from one of the companies I have done some work for in the past. The boss straight up just asked me if I would be interested in a full time job. I was delighted, they were a good company, young and ambitious. 

I met with them a few days later and had a somewhat informal interview, outlining the position and the role etc. All seemed to be perfect, until it wasn't. At the end of our conversation the boss told me about one of their company policies. That all new hires we placed on an internship program for a period of 3-6 months. It was a paid internship, but he didn't give any figures at this time. I was pretty dejected and had to think about it. They said they had a few more people to talk to and would be in touch soon.

I calculated that with the savings I had and if I lived frugally I could maybe make it work. It would be tough, but possible. I considered the pros and cons and decided if they offered it to me I would take it, depending on how long the internship would last, if it was 3 months then yes I would take it, if it was any more I would have to really take my time with the decision.

Fast forward to the next day and I get a call from from the boss and I was told that they would be willing to hire me on an internship period of 4 months and that the pay would be 1000 a month. I had a quick think on the phone and whilst it was longer than the 3 months I had hoped for, my gut told me to do it. So i accepted.

I joined the company in mid May and have really enjoyed it for the most part. It was a big change for me going from freelance to working essentially a 9-5 (most days anyways)

The trouble begins when it is time to start talking about my full time contract. I knew I was going to be offered a full time position as everything had gone really well up to that point. Last month I sat down with the bosses and we discussed salary etc. After a bit of back and forth over the next few days we settled on a number. 

The problem now has arisen because I stupidly miscalculated when i would be getting my first full pay day. I somehow had it in my head that it would be last month, but of course it is this month. It was a 4 month program, so I would be paid 4 times at that rate and the next would be the full one. I should have known better. The problem is that I had committed myself to some new expenses from last month as I thought I would be able to cover it with my new salary. Of course when I realised that wouldn't be happening until the following month I knew I would have a problem.

Basically my total expenses at this point come to about 1100 a month, not including food. So last month I opened an overdraft on my bank account to the amount of 500, silly mistake number one. At this point, with 5 days left to pay day my bank account it sitting at -500. Which means whilst I will be getting roughly 1700 salary into my account on Wednesday, that will immediately go down to about 1200. Of which about 1100 is already budgeted for.

To make matter worse, I was contacted by my accountant and he told me that I owed 500 in taxes for the 2017 fiscal year from ym freelance days. That is due on October 31st. So now I am really up shit creek.

I could go to family, but I don't really want to as they have helped me lots in the past. That would be my last resort. I would much rather do this on my own.

What are my options?

So here is my situation currently:
 - Bank account sitting at -500 currently
 - 500 in taxes owed on 31st of October
 - 1700 incoming on 31st October

I am considering getting a small personal loan of 1500 from my bank, to be paid back over a 1 year period. The interest rate is 8.65 %, which equates to 130.48 a month. The total cost of the loan is 65.76, which seems reasonable to me.

I figure this amount will cover the overdraft in the account of 500, along with the tax bill of 500 and will leave me with enough to live on for the next month, until my next payday. Then from next payday I will start paying it back in small amounts.

Is this a terrible idea?

Sorry for the wall of text!"

9rkgkg,0,2018-10-26,Any tips on responding to a Job Offer asking for more money?,Imadoctah,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9rkgkg/any_tips_on_responding_to_a_job_offer_asking_for/,"Hey personal finance,

Hoping you might be willing to offer some insight.

**TL;DR - Company I intern for offered me full time, but the $ is slightly below average.  Never had to do salary negotiations before and don't know what I'm doing/proper etiquette.**

I'm graduating with a bachelors in engineering in a few weeks, and the company I'm interning for has just extended me a full time offer.  I love the company, I want the job, its the work I want to be doing.  Here's what I know;

I've done my research, I know what the average starting salary is for entry level persons, with my specific job title, and the offer is a few grand shy.  Not a dealbreaker, but shy non-the less.

While this is entry level, and my first actual engineering role, I've got a great deal of related experience;

* 5 years interning (across 4 internships) in the same industry, in similar job functions
* 1 year working as a debug technician in the same industry
* All 6 of those years were hands on, technical experience that have taught me boatloads.  (40+/week)
* The last year of those 6 years has been interning *for this company* showcasing my skill-set/work ethic which I've been recognized for on a few occasions.

Given all the above, I was hoping to get a bit about the average starting, but would be totally comfortable hitting the average dead on.  And honestly, with it only being a few grand low, I'd probably take that too because its the work I want to be doing.  But I think I owe it to my future self to *at least try* to get them to bump it up to the average.

&amp;#x200B;

So my big question is, whats a good way to go about this?  The recruiter whose handling the opening doesn't actually work on-site, they're about a 20min drive  (They came out to my location for my interview).  Should I request a meeting with them and make them drive out to me again?  Should I go to them?  I was thinking about just writing a detailed email with all my justifications, but I worry that might not be stern enough to be taken seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

Any/all advice is welcome!"

As i just finished with vocational school and looking for a place to work for i really just really want to know things that would help me in my career like should i just go straight for machinist's certificate etc etc.
And as bonus question that's been bothering me ever since my internship: Is it completely normal having the need to ask for help often. It felt very awkward and seemed to bother the older machinists a bit, on my last internship it took me ~month to operate the CNC machining centre alone (Not just pressing feedstart).

Thanks in advance already.
And also if you know any sites that would help in learning it would be appreciated.
Thanks again :)

9rlihe,11,2018-10-26,I need help - resume review? a hug? something,throwawayforwhining1,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/9rlihe/i_need_help_resume_review_a_hug_something/,"Fair warning... this is going to be fairly woe-is-me so by no means are you obligated to read it. I just gotta vent SOMEWHERE and I'm starting to feel bad for my eternally patient fiance who takes the brunt of it!

For background, I did a master's thesis in something useless (within geology) because I thought at the time I wanted to go into academia. Changed my mind during grad school and looked for environmental jobs as I was coming up on graduation. Ended up in Oklahoma with an actually pretty sweet O&amp;G exploration job because that's all I could find (haha, 2012, it's so different now...). I enjoyed it but always wanted to get out so I could one day move back up north where I belong (and my family is). I also always kind of felt like a fraud in the OK/TX O&amp;G industry where people tend to assume everyone else is super conservative and just like them. My company closed their Tulsa office in 2016 and offered me a job at HQ, but I declined because I knew I needed to get out eventually anyway (and my fiance and I do like Tulsa for the time being; at this point we own a house). I got a job through a friend that I thought would be more science-communications oriented (something that's always interested me), but turned out to be a combination of customer service and administrative work. The pay is good, but I hate working here. I feel like my brain is turning to mush, there is no potential for advancement, and the experience is not setting me up for anything but a ""career"" as an administrative assistant.

I have been applying for entry-level environmental jobs since November 2017. I really threw myself into it *hard* starting in April of this year. I've done maybe ten phone and in-person informational interviews with friends-of-friends and acquaintances-of-acquaintances-of-acquaintances (which is exhausting and terrifying and makes me really anxious, but I'm so grateful for how generous people have been with their time). I took two days of vacation and went to a Brownfields conference in OKC (I'm in Tulsa), which was awesome and got me really excited about working in the industry (fuck, I listened to EPA webinars on my 3-hour round trip drive each day and was getting pumped about that). Two people told me to send them their resumes, but nothing has come of it. No one I've talked to has had any suggestions about relevant local networking or educational events... at this point I'm pretty sure they don't exist (geology in Oklahoma is dominated by the O&amp;G industry and the local professional orgs reflect that).

I drove to Little Rock to take the FG exam earlier this month because Oklahoma doesn't license geologists and I thought it would make me look more serious about switching from O&amp;G to environmental, and also show that my brain hasn't completely rotted in the two years I've been in this stupid job. I think I did OK, and people I talked to seemed to think it was a good idea to take it, but I'm starting to feel like that was pointless too and no one will care.

I am starting to think I should go ahead and get the OSHA 40-hour HAZWOPER certification on my own, but it would have to be fully online since I can't find anything in-person in my area, and I'm concerned employers would look badly on that.

Today I was creeping on LinkedIn and looking at a company that rejected me (at least they actually sent a rejection email, which literally never happens) and I saw the woman they hired instead. She had been working as a convenience store manager for the last nine months (encouraging!) BUT was a 2017 grad with a lot of relevant internships during undergrad. I don't have that and I can't turn back the clock.

I have considered a local PSM program in environmental management (someone from an environmental firm in town told me she pretty much exclusively hires from that program because she knows what she's getting). I have the savings to pay for it, and my current job is flexible enough I think it would work, but it would take two years and at some point I want to start having kids so my fiance isn't, like, 65 when they graduate high school. Also, part of me thinks it's nuts to have two master's degrees. Like, could you not figure out what you wanted?!

I'm just so burned out on job searching and networking, but I feel like if I take a break I'll miss some golden opportunity or people in my network will think I've lost interest. I feel like I've failed myself, my family (they were super excited and proud of my geology education and career), womankind (just another woman who dropped out of STEM for secretarial work! fucking awesome), my alma maters and everyone there who helped me.

I excelled in school. I have been well-liked by my coworkers and managers and been a significant contributor in both professional adult jobs I've held. What the fuck am I doing wrong? Is this what the economy is like now? I'm just *so tired*. I swear if someone just gives me a chance I will work SO HARD FOR THEM because I know this is my last chance at a remotely interesting career.

My resume (reworked this morning for what feels like the one millionth time) is [here](https://docdro.id/UOw7RhM) (PDF). Any advice is welcome, even if it's ""just give the fuck up already, you are unhireable for professional technical work."" (OK, any advice except ""try mudlogging"" ;)) And if you successfully took an unconventional path into environmental work, I would love to hear your story, maybe it'll give me ideas and/or hope?!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: [Updated, shorter resume](https://docdro.id/XXOPxaF) thanks to your excellent suggestions. Thank you guys so much for the tips and support!"

9rmqie,2,2018-10-26,At what point do I quit my job?,fleuries,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/9rmqie/at_what_point_do_i_quit_my_job/,"I was hired in July but have low-key wanted to quit since I started.

An acquaintance of mine used to have the position and was the one who turned me on to it but the boss obviously liked her a lot better than me. There were a couple days where the three of us worked together and boss lady (hereby BL) would always defer to the other girl on everything. When it's just BL and me, she always brings up the other girl and if I do anything wrong BL talks about how other girl would do things.
BL is super passive aggressive and judgemental about me and a lot of other people. She also has started asking me to come in more but never gives me enough notice to request the days off from my other job and then gets mad when I can't come in because I'm scheduled elsewhere. This week we had some packages come in that I was going to price and put away and BL wanted me in on Thursday but I was scheduled for Thursday already. I asked if I could come in on Wednesday instead and BL tells me to just come in today (Friday). Last night (9p on Thursday) BL texts me and tells me that she did everything by herself and to not come in today, just come in on Friday and days she told me all the packages would be getting in on Thursday. Except she never told me that, she only said they'd be here this week. She could have said that she really needed me on Thursday and I would've called in to my other job to come in since that's how BL is but she didn't. Am I in the wrong here? She's hardly upfront with me at all and not considerate of the fact that I have multiple jobs.
There has been another time where I didn't have anything to do so I responded to a couple emails for my internship and she blew up on me about how I shouldn't be doing other work while I'm there event though I literally didn't have anything to do so I sat there and stared off into space until she finished the document she was editing before I could retype it. It's a small locally owned business but I try to avoid her and stay in another room as often as I can because she's so controlling.
She's just really rude and constantly comparing me to someone who worked there for two years when I've only just started. I've stayed because there are a couple things I want to buy since I get half off and the pay is best of my three jobs and hours are most consistent until she starts cutting my hours because she's so petty. It's not like I told her I couldn't come in at all, I just wanted to switch the days around. 
She always throws the fact that she never gets a day off in my face but that's not my problem. This is just a part time job for me to help pay the bills but I don't think it's worth the headache of having to deal with her anymore. I'm a full time student with three jobs and an internship and she acts like this not being my biggest priority is something that validates her shooting me down. 
I've tried getting on her good side by wearing nicer clothes, buying a pair of heels (even though I've never worn heels before), and bringing her stuff like salmon jerky and it's all still in the shadow of me not being what she wants me to be even though I'm trying my best. 
She'll tell me we're going to do something and then go off to do something else so I'll do something else to keep busy and she'll get mad as if I should have stood by the door doing nothing and waited for her to get back. She also doesn't like cats because they don't come when they're called so she's kinda treating me like how she'd treat a dog which would sit patiently at the door to go on a walk.
It's just very frustrating and I guess I'm venting more than anything now but I would like someone else's input if anyone is interested in weighing in.

TLDR my boss is passive aggressive, petty, and controlling + wishes I were her last assistant and/or a dog &amp; I'm getting sick of it."

It’s probably better aimed at r/offmychest or r/rant but idk

Before responding I ask you to be open minded. To some of you the answer is clear, and before you start bashing my emotional immaturity I just ask you read this through the eyes of a man with heart that has been broken several times back to back.

I’m(22M) really in a bad place at the moment. I’ve been seeing this girl(21F) for the past 6-7months. And it’s been a lot of ups and downs, and Ive been super depressed. It’s not only affecting my mental health, it affects my relationship with other family members, and even my professional life. 

It’s been a “no commitment”/friends with benefits. Except I have feelings for her that I just can’t put down. I confessed my strong feelings for her about 2 months in and she said maybe in the future. Which is what kept me going. 

However, she wants her cake and wants to eat it too. I’m an emotional body pillow, and a dick to ride whenever she needs it. She can be a bitch to me at times. She sometimes leaves me hanging and takes days to respond when I take 30mins or cancels the day of or last minute. I’m always genuine and never irritated or displaying any sort of anger towards her. I literally take every hit to the nuts with a smile on my face saying it’s okay there’s always next week. Have a good day

I know she’s fucking other guys, I know she cancels hanging out with me to fuck other guys. And when it doesn’t go well she texts me. When I message her about her day, or to let her know I’m thinking about her, or I hope she is well, she just reminds me that we aren’t dating. But then will ask me over to cuddle, watch Netflix and eat breakfast in the morning. 

I was suppose to see her last night, I was looking forward to it as I had a very shitty work week. However she cancels the day of, and I saw on a snap story that she was at another guys house and I know she spent the night... And for some reason this particular instance hurt me more. The anxiety makes me physically sick.

I have no resentment towards her. I understand she’s young and hot and has the ability to fuck who ever she pleases. I’m a low priority to her, and there’s nothing I can do about it. Im sure she’ll message me again wanting to hook up, but idk if I can do it anymore. Hoping that it will turn to something meaningful rather than just sex or because she’s lonely and wants company.

I have a really good internship going for me, I’m goin into the hardest semester of my life. I’m making good gains at the gym. And this situation is jeopardizing all of that, as my depression and anxiety is so loud sometimes all I want to do is cry and sleep all day. 

I’ve learned a lot about myself in this situation as I’ve never been this hurt before even in prior relationships. I’ve realized that I have underlying insecurity issues. I want to work on my mental health, to fix these but each day-day hoping she won’t cancel or she’ll message me is so exhausting. I feel so pathetic, the  “why am I not good enough” is always present. I don’t look forward to anything anymore. My job requires a decent amount of brain power and I’m so distracted that I don’t get much work done anymore. I just want this pain to subside and don’t know how to handle it. "
9rn129,4,2018-10-26,On making myself unavailable,loveischemicals,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/9rn129/on_making_myself_unavailable/,"So I read some information about setting boundaries and availability and was kind of exploring the dynamics that make my dead bedroom a thing.  Basically my wife is LL and I'm ultra HL... we lived poly before my son was born... now that he's 5 I've not been able to have any other relationships because she ran them off, but she also won't have sex with me except maybe once a month and for a few minutes at a time.  Sounds like I'm complaining I know but I'm really just catching everyone up because this is the objective situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if maybe the problem is that I'm making myself too available for her.  Like, I don't do anything anymore because I want to.  I used to write music a lot (and made money selling licenses to it), I used to run a blackjack team that made decent money, I had a couple other little hobbies... most of which were also side-businesses.  I dropped them all over the years and honestly I did it for no conscious reason other than she requested more of my time to do other stuff with her or to give her breaks from adult responsibilities.  She started only getting horny when I was out of town or at work or elsewhere and then would lament the missed opportunity over text.  Somehow this turned into me spending all my free time physically with her... in hopes that just in case she actually did end up in the mood, opportunity would be there.  My research led me to believe that being always available like this turns people off (and that vibes with how awesome the sex was between us when we were dating long-distance and only saw each other once a month or so) so I've been pondering pushing back against this dynamic.  Now it's just becoming pathetic... today she asked me to come home from work early to have sex with her (last time I did that she needed me to talk to the leasing office for her since ""they don't listen to me because i'm a woman"", and it was too close to my son getting off the bus ""because you didn't leave sooner"" so we didn't do anything...).  

I decided to start setting boundaries then and there.  I reminded her that I took the entire day off Wednesday to spend just with her... she chose she wanted to go shopping together instead of having sex, which is fine if she's happy with that choice.  I'm a full-time employee and the only one making income, I need to ensure I stay in good standing at work and get projects done on time but we'd have the whole weekend together with no obligations.  I also couldn't leave work early because I'm the only one in my department here besides our intern who doesn't have a key to lock up.  

The responses came immediately:

1. she didn't want sex Wednesday due to stomach issues, she wants it now.
2. we only had 2 hours Wednesday and that's not much time (this immediately after celebrating that if I left immediately we'd have a half-hour before my son gets off the bus... not to mention sex hasn't lasted longer than 10 minutes in over 5 years now)
3. she can only have sex during the day because at night she is always in too much back, neck, or stomach pain (she has scoliosis but also has no physically demanding obligations and is not so bad that it qualifies for surgery or other interventions besides Tylenol.)
4. She wants to try fasting because if she gives up eating food she can't have stomach problems 
5. She's sorry she tried to get me to leave work because that's rude... I explain that wasn't rude it's just not wise for me to do today... 
6. ""Then what the fuck and I supposed to say?... what words \[will you\] accept?!"" 
7. She cut off a mole on her inner thigh while shaving and so now we can't have sex all weekend.

Eventually this devolved into ""I'm a shitty person you should be with someone else"" and so I ask if she cut herself on purpose?  ""fuck no"".  Well that's the only conceivable way someone could think she's a shitty person is if all that stuff was on purpose.  ""I just meant my health keeps us from being together"".  So is her health going to be between us no matter what?  ""I have no power over it"".  So nothing we do to fight it will help us push past it and be together again?  ""How do you not know that or understand that""

Then she decided to stop chatting because she is too depressed and angry and sad and doesn't know what to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I have thoughts about this but would rather hear yours: those of you who have dealt with lost causes or those who turned their DB around... how would you interpret these behaviors?  Am I right to keep making myself scarcer or am I making the situation worse?  Is this what health-based DB looks like or does this seem more behavior-based?


EDIT/UPDATE:  this actually culminated in sex when I got back home; nothing to write home about but definitely not just duty sex.  She put a movie on for our son and as it turns out hadn't cut herself nor had any back, stomach, or neck pain.  I'm going to keep asserting boundaries and more obviously communicating needs over the next few weeks... maybe it'll turn her on or maybe it'll piss her off... at this point it could go either way and I think I'd be fine with it and that's a better feeling than not knowing what the fuck is going on or where the real issues are coming from.  Thanks everyone it's a work in progress but it is progress I guess..."

kenmerk 2018Z16888&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
Heeft u kennisgenomen van het bericht ‘Militair moet zelf jas kopen’ in de  
Telegraaf van 25 september 2018? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;

Hoe is het mogelijk dat het onderdeel KPU &amp;#40;Kleding en Persoonsgebonden  
Uitrustingsbedrijf&amp;#41; van het ministerie van Defensie in een jaar tijd niet  
eens in staat is voldoende winterjassen aan te schaffen?  
16  
Wat bent u van plan te gaan ondernemen om de huidige situatie met de  
winterjassen voor de oefening in Noorwegen op te lossen?  
18  
Als u de inkoop van winterjassen niet voor 1 november 2018 weet af te  
ronden, deelt u dan de opvatting dat het beter is dat u uw functie  
overdraagt aan een professional die wel in staat is orde op zaken te  
stellen op het departement?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De onderjassen uit het koudweer pakket, die een aanvulling vormen bij de  
standaard militaire buitenjassen, zijn inmiddels geleverd en worden  
verstrekt aan de eenheden die deelnemen aan Trident Juncture. Ik verwijs  
verder naar mijn brief van 8 oktober jl. met kenmerk BS2018023861.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
Hoe houdt u toezicht op de materieelinkopen bij Defensie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Defensie houdt intern toezicht op de verwerving door de voortgang van de  
projecten bij te houden, hierover intern te rapporteren en regelmatig  
projectbesprekingen te houden. Daarnaast houdt de afdeling Toezicht  
Defensie Leveranciers &amp;#40;TDL&amp;#41; toezicht bij leveranciers om kwaliteit te  
kunnen garanderen. De Defensie Materieel Organisatie is hiervoor  
verantwoordelijk.   
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
Wie is de hoofdverantwoordelijke functionaris binnen Defensie voor de  
inkoop van materieel? Wordt hij of zij verantwoordelijk gehouden voor het  
niet halen van targets, deadlines of het falen in het naleven van zijn of  
haar verplichtingen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De verwerving van het grootste deel van het materieel voor Defensie wordt  
uitgevoerd door de Defensie Materieel Organisatie &amp;#40;DMO&amp;#41;. De directeur van  
de DMO rapporteert aan de Secretaris-Generaal van Defensie. Daarnaast zijn  
de krijgsmachtdelen en de Defensiestaf verantwoordelijk voor het tijdig  
stellen van de juiste behoefte. De krijgsmachtdelen rapporteren aan de  
Commandant der Strijdkrachten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
Hoe vaak komt het voor dat het KPU van Defensie de inkoop van materieel  
niet op tijd rond krijgt voorafgaande aan een missie of oefening? Kunt u  
een overzicht geven van de geleverde materialen bij alle missies van de  
afgelopen vijf jaar?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het algemeen voorziet het KPU-bedrijf de militairen tijdig van hun  
kleding en uitrusting. In die gevallen dat niet tijdig een nieuw contract  
kan worden afgesloten terwijl het oude contract is verlopen, of een  
leverancier bij levering niet aan de kwaliteitseisen voldoet kan vertraging  
optreden. In die gevallen wordt eerst bekeken of een alternatief artikel  
met equivalente functie kan worden verstrekt. In die gevallen waar dat niet  
kan wordt een maatwerkoplossing op basis van zelfstandige aanschaf  
toegepast. Het is niet bekend hoe vaak dit precies gebeurt omdat dit niet  
wordt geregistreerd.

Kunt u een overzicht geven van alle materieel dat militairen in eerste  
instantie zelf moeten voorschieten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het assortiment van het Defensie Kleding en Persoonsgebonden Uitrusting  
bedrijf voorziet, om de functionaliteit en de veiligheid van de militair te  
waarborgen, in eerste instantie in alle kleding en uitrusting van de  
militair.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er zijn uitzonderlijke situaties waarin de militair zelf persoonsgebonden  
uitrusting aanschaft. Dit kan zijn in het geval van maatwerk, waarbij het  
gaat om specifieke maatvoering en het efficiënter is om deze op individuele  
basis aan te schaffen, of voor specifieke oefeningen waarbij de standaard  
uitrusting ontoereikend is, en in het geval dat artikelen niet in voldoende  
mate op voorraad zijn.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In deze gevallen wordt aan de militair een Zelfstandige Aanschaf brief &amp;#40;ZA-  
brief&amp;#41; verstrekt met toestemming om het artikel zelf aan te kopen. In deze  
brief wordt de militair geadviseerd welke producten voldoen aan de  
veiligheidseisen. De militair kan ervoor kiezen om het benodigde geld zelf  
voor te schieten en achteraf te declareren, of ervoor kiezen om een  
voorschot aan te vragen. In het geval van Trident Juncture was het niet de  
bedoeling en niet nodig dat militairen het bedrag moesten voorschieten.  
&amp;nbsp;

Komt het voor dat militairen zelf materieel moeten aanschaffen zonder dat  
zij dit kunnen declareren? Zo ja, kunt u hier een overzicht van sturen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee, voor persoonsgebonden uitrusting die zelfstandig moet worden  
aangeschaft wordt toestemming verleend. De militair kan ervoor kiezen om  
het benodigde geld zelf voor te schieten en achteraf te declareren, of  
ervoor kiezen om een voorschot aan te vragen. In het geval van Trident  
Juncture was het niet de bedoeling en niet nodig dat militairen het bedrag  
moesten voorschieten. Het kan overigens altijd voorkomen dat een militair  
er voor kiest om zelf aanvullende uitrusting aan te schaffen hoewel  
Defensie hem of haar van uitrusting heeft voorzien. In dat geval zijn er  
geen voorschot- of declaratiemogelijkheden.

Wat is het huidige jaarbudget van het Kleding en Persoonsgebonden  
Uitrustingsbedrijf &amp;#40;KPU&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor de instandhouding van de meer dan 3000 verschillende artikelen bij het  
KPU-bedrijf is dit jaar een budget beschikbaar van 43 miljoen euro.  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
Hoeveel geld heeft het KPU nodig om militairen van fatsoenlijk materieel te  
voorzien?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De hoogte van voorraden kleding en uitrusting is vastgelegd in normen. De  
normen voor inzet &amp;#40;BKI&amp;#41; zijn vastgesteld, voor gereedstelling  
&amp;#40;verbruiksnormen&amp;#41; moet een deel van de normen nog worden ontwikkeld.  
Daarnaast is recent gemeld &amp;#40;kamerstuk 27830 nr. 268&amp;#41; dat Defensie de normen  
opnieuw gaat bezien in het licht van het toenemend belang van de eerste  
hoofdtaak &amp;#40;bondgenootschappelijke verdediging&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De voorraden worden op niveau gehouden via de exploitatiebegroting.  
Daarnaast wordt nieuwe kleding en uitrusting door DMO verworven om het  
assortiment aan te passen aan de behoefte. De krijgsmachtdelen of de  
Defensiestaf stellen hiervoor de behoefte. Hierover wordt de Kamer  
geïnformeerd via de brieven conform het Defensie Materieelproces, de  
begroting, het jaarverslag en het materieelprojectenoverzicht.

Kunt u een overzicht geven van de tekorten bij Defensie met betrekking tot  
materieel over de afgelopen 30 jaar?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de afgelopen 30 jaar is bezuinigd op de Defensie uitgaven. Dit heeft in  
het materieel domein geleid tot een verminderde inzetbaarheid van systemen.  
U bent hierover geïnformeerd via de begroting en het jaarverslag. Daarnaast  
heeft u in de inzetbaarheidsrapportages kunnen vernemen welke problemen van  
materiele aard er de afgelopen jaren hebben gespeeld.  
In de Defensienota zijn plannen uiteengezet om de krijgsmacht te  
moderniseren. Deze plannen zijn leidend voor de samenstelling en de  
toerusting van de krijgsmacht, die beter is uitgerust om huidige en  
toekomstige dreigingen het hoofd te bieden.

Kunt u een overzicht verschaffen van nu lopende aankooptrajecten van  
materieel en hun deadlines en deze de Kamer doen toekomen &amp;#40;eventueel  
vertrouwelijk&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Over lopende en geplande materieelprojecten is de Kamer steeds geïnformeerd  
middels de Defensienota &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 34 919, nr. 1&amp;#41;, de Defensiebegroting en  
het Materieelprojectenoverzicht.   
&amp;nbsp;    
13  
Hoe is nu de situatie bij Defensie met betrekking tot ander materieel waar  
de leden van FVD-fractie op 3 oktober 2017 aandacht voor vroegen? In  
hoeverre krijgen militairen nu adequate schoenen en vesten? In hoeverre  
kopen ze die nog zelf?  
14  
Kunt een overzicht sturen van alle materieel dat doorgaans zelf wordt  
aangeschaft door militairen, omdat het geleverde materieel niet voldoet aan  
hun eisen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Defensie is verantwoordelijk voor het voorzien in voldoende en juiste  
uitrusting voor het personeel.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vanuit de bestaande voorraad en de lopende contracten worden militairen  
voorzien van adequate schoenen en vesten. Daarvoor wordt al een draagproef  
uitgevoerd. Vanaf het voorjaar van 2019 worden nieuwe schoenen geleverd en  
verstrekt aan het militaire personeel. De projecten Vervanging  
gevechtsuitrusting en Verbetering Operationeel Soldaat Systeem &amp;#40;VOSS&amp;#41;  
voorzien in nieuwe vesten voor gevechtseenheden en overige eenheden, zoals  
is gemeld in het Materieelprojectenoverzicht 2018 &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 27830, nr.  
259&amp;#41;. Daarnaast wordt met het project Defensie Operationeel Kleding Systeem  
&amp;#40;DOKS&amp;#41; de volledige krijgsmacht uitgerust met kwantitatief voldoende en  
kwalitatief hoogwaardige nieuwe gevechtskleding die voldoet aan alle eisen  
ten aanzien van functionaliteit, bescherming, pasvorm, comfort en  
uitstraling. Hierover bent u recent geïnformeerd &amp;#40;kamerstuk 27830 nr. 260&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast komt het voor dat militairen zelf extra spullen aanschaffen die  
in hun ogen nog beter, handiger of professioneler zijn, dan de uitrusting  
die Defensie verstrekt. Een overzicht daarvan is niet beschikbaar omdat het  
een eigen keuze van de militair betreft.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het assortiment kleding en uitrusting van Defensie wordt regelmatig herzien  
en verbeterd als gevolg van ontwikkelingen in technologie en op basis van  
de behoefte van de militairen. Defensie onderzoekt het introduceren van  
keuzevrijheid in het kleding- en uitrustingsassortiment. Bijvoorbeeld de  
gevechtslaarzen zouden hiervoor in de toekomst in aanmerking kunnen komen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
15  
Kunt u een overzicht sturen van al het materieel dat een militair meekrijgt  
&amp;#40;eventueel vertrouwelijk&amp;#41;? Kunt u dit uitsplitsen op lopende missies en  
aanstaande oefeningen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Defensie kent een grote verscheidenheid aan kleding- en  
uitrustingspakketten. Dit betreft ongeveer 1000 pakketten. Iedere militair  
heeft de beschikking over een basispakket. Daarnaast worden pakketten  
verstrekt voor specifieke functies, taken en omstandigheden. Ten slotte  
zijn er daarbovenop nog ongeveer 700 individuele pakketten voor specifiek  
maatwerk. Ter illustratie is een overzicht van het basispakket als  
&amp;#40;vertrouwelijke&amp;#41; bijlage 7 bij deze brief gevoegd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De verantwoordelijkheid voor verwerving en instandhouding voor deze  
pakketten ligt bij de DMO, de verantwoordelijkheid voor de behoeftestelling  
&amp;#40;voor oefeningen en inzet&amp;#41; ligt bij de krijgsmachtdelen en de Defensiestaf.  
&amp;nbsp;

Gaat u maatregelen nemen om vergelijkbare situaties in de toekomst te  
voorkomen? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, wat en op welke termijn?

9rn7ab,8,2018-10-26,Is there hope for an expat in Denmark?,askepott1,Denmark,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/9rn7ab/is_there_hope_for_an_expat_in_denmark/,"Hei hei,

In my 28 years of age, I decided to reshape my IT career a bit and applied for computer science AP degree in Denmark with the hope that this will be a solid foundation for further studies and work in Denmark. Accepted, I had a quick talk over this with my significant other and, as she got an intern position in another city for her doctoral studies, we came here (separated by over 250km for now).

First issue I encountered was the lack of affordable housing (Roskilde and it's whereabouts). What gives? Even when looking as a group of multiple students, it's nearly impossible to find a place to live. My current contract will end at the end of semester and after that I'm basically homeless. And yes, I've applied to all the kollegium student residences through [*s.dk*](https://s.dk), swarm facebook groups and ask anyone and everyone for options.

Next thing is employment. I have well over 5 years of significant experience in IT and haven't got a single interview. Every single company just keeps saying the same thing: ""The response to the position was overwhelming and, unfortunately, we have chosen someone who's better suited to this position"". And this was even for student part-time jobs that should be for people without **any** experience. How is this possible? I had LinkedIN premium for a bit and it showed that many with Master degrees are applying for entry-level positions. This just doesn't make any sense in the context of newspapers and government organizations declaring that there is a lack of IT workers in the country.

The quality of the studies themselves is very poor. This is mainly because of the poor English language skills of the tutors, but also because they just can't explain basic concepts like interfaces despite their 7+ years of experience in the industry (I've been told they were headhunted by schools right out of the industry).  Is it only my school or the same situation is the same elsewhere? I talked to some locals in school and they said that it's pretty much the same no matter where you study.

Furthermore, apparently just a couple months ago Danish language courses were made paid-only, effectively prohibiting foreign students from being able to afford to learn the language to assimilate in the culture.

I guess this rant is not really a real question, though I kindly urge any expats/Danish locals to add their thoughts on this situation. Are EU workers not wanted by the Danish society? I wasn't even able to open a bank account in Nordea just because they said ""unless you have a job contract, we don't see a reason for you to have a bank account in this country"".

&amp;#x200B;

For example,  on the Twitch engineering internship 2019 description, knowing Linux means ""digging around /proc to see if you can squeeze a bit more  performance out of the tcp stack.""  That sounds like a lot more than being able to use a Linux system using the command line utilities comfortably. "
9rntce,73,2018-10-26,"In 2018, I started low, got very high, and ended up very low. Probably nobody will bother to read my story, but I felt like writing all of it down",whydontyouupvoteme,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9rntce/in_2018_i_started_low_got_very_high_and_ended_up/,"Some important background info: Age 21, been doing NoFap since 2014, addicted to porn since 2011. Grew up as a shy, introverted kid who got bullied often. Thought of committing suicide before I found out about NoFap and decided to give it a try. Life became a bliss. I improved massively. But lately, my progress was stagnant...


2018 was quite a year for me. I learned a lot. I had my first girlfriend ever. I had my first job ever. I had my biggest streak ever. And I lost them all.


It all began in January, when due to massive amounts of stress (final exams), I found myself in bed unable to concentrate. My next exam was coming and fighting urges all day became very taxing for me so I decided I'd just fap without porn or even fantasizing. I ended my 200+ days streak right there. I was assaulted by urges the following few days. I was unable to maintain a streak longer than 50+ days ever since.



I met my now ex-girlfriend in April, a week after my birthday. She was an A-student and also very pretty. That made her very desired and popular among students (even though she had few friends herself). I do college projects for extra bucks, and she found me through some friend recommendation. When we met in person, we clicked instantly. I flirted boldly and she reciprocated. Even though I am quite unpopular, and I also have an average face and mild acne, my body is top notch and so is my confidence. Everything that was under my control, I improved. (Take notice, young fellas!) She suggested we hang out. My mind still can't compute this because I look like a beta from the outside (until you interact with me in real life). 



Around this point I also got accepted for my summer job. Confidence was sky high. The local stock market peaked and I was making some nice pocket money. I also started hanging out with friends more and went to a few parties. I had everything figured out at this point. Career, Love, Money, Friends. The girl was the missing piece. Life was amazing. I felt like the king of the world and couldn't wait to wake up every day.


The date with the girl was good, in the beginning. We connected because she was a struggling, hard working, smart woman. Struggle (NoFap) defined my life, so willpower was what I was looking for in a partner. But when I found out, around the end, how superficial and insecure she is and how she has no life goals other than earning lots of money and spending them to make others jealous, I got turned off instantly. The desire to kiss her faded immediately. She liked the date, and was disappointed when I told her I didn't feel a connection. After I reached home, my loneliness and desire for validation kicked in. I wanted a hot, popular girlfriend to brag to all of those people who made fun of me/bullied me in the past. Come on, she can take me as a role model and I will fix her.
So I texted her and she excitedly agreed on a second date.


But this girl was attending college and worked full time, so she didn't find any time for it. At this point I got high on validation and became desperate for her attention. When we talked in person, we were happy, but when we were texting, we were arguing. My 2 month long relationship was full of emotional roller coasters. So I dumped her before she dumped me.


At least her project (remember it?) was completed successfully and she paid me, but my heart was broken.
During our relationship, I had zero PMO urges. NoFap was a breeze. 2 month streak easy peasy. But then I binged hard. I knowingly pursued a non-sense, toxic relationship. Yet I still crave that validation when I feel lonely.


Immediately after the breakup, I started my first job. I loved what I did. It was a team project involving software and hardware design. Because none of my teammates knew how to do hardware stuff, I did it all by myself. Lots of responsibility on my side. One mistake in production? Those boards come from China in 3 weeks and they cost a lot. No second versions. Those bosses kept adding/removing features that screwed up my work so I had to start over a few times. Luckily my part worked almost perfectly on first try. Then I turned to help my colleagues with their stuff. 
 

It was a summer internship kind of job, and at the end of the summer, they picked 2 out of 3 people. Guess who got fired because ""oh you are great but we don't need hardware guys"". My colleagues were shy so I was the guy who made my/our complaints heard, and this probably backfired. Now I'm actively looking for a job but guess what, nobody hires interns at this time of the year. And they know it. 


After I broke up with my ex, I tried to fap without porn once a week because I heard that moderating fapping reduces your neediness and is overall healthier for you. I also didn't have the required willpower to go on a long streak at that point. Due to stress and loneliness, I keep getting destroyed by the chaser effect so this didn't work. Constant PMO binging led to a degrading quality of life to the point that I feel the same as in 2014, before I started NoFap. :( A sad, lonely, unmotivated little fucker with no life goals, who wanted to end his life. 


The last positive thing in my life is working out. I am doing strength training and seeing great improvements. I feel like I need this in my life not to go insane. 


What NoFap did wonders for me lays in the mood swings. One day I may feel like shit, but the next day I may feel so amazing and motivated that I start a new habit and improve my life long term. These moments of heightened confidence, desire and motivation are what changed me. I have, by my very nature, massive willpower but low discipline. Combine that with a positive mood swing and there you have a powerful, short term force to do even the scariest, most embarrassing, most daunting task. And once you crack the nut and start, it gets easier.

9ro3li,2,2018-10-26,"24 year old, US, with terrible credit score from an unpaid University bill. Trying to get my life back in order",bluecowboyboots2,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9ro3li/24_year_old_us_with_terrible_credit_score_from_an/,"I grew up pretty well off, and I was gifted lots of opportunities. I kind of always naturally expected my parents would put me through school. 

I attended a private college in Florida for a year. I got a scholarship for 26,000. My dad seemed to have had it taken care of and my mom and I never questioned it. 

I ended up transferring back home and going to a public school. Turns out that once I transferred, my father had not been working and we were on the brink of losing out house. My car that I had since my 16th birthday was taken. 
Honestly I was a bit spoiled growing up and I never really understood the value of hard work or even how to budget until that happened. I had a few businesses where I made a couple thousand in the summer but thats it. 

My mom found out about my dad lying to us, and that he really wasnt bringing money in from his job.. etc and immediately applied me for financial aid. 

I moved on and killed it at school, got well paying internships in finance. When I moved to the city, I applied to rent an apartment for 3 months and they needed a credit score check. I assumed my credit score was fine and had no history. 
The apartment immediatly rejected me. I looked on credit karma and got so sad. My dad never paid for my freshman year and I had a collections acount of $21,239. I was honestly beyond pissed off, my dad low key effed the possibilities for me to get an apartment etc out of college. 

I graduated, and took a year off because I was depressed and had health issues. I didn't work. 
I am now feeling better and will be applying for jobs soon. I am just worried about my credit score. Will it affect employment for me? 

I have $15,242	worth of student loans and I have been making my payments with my savings from last year so they are in good standing. 

My credit score on credit karma is 669-672. 
Not sure if this is the place for me to ask this, but what can I do? I have never had a credit card in my life and i am not sure if I want to get one when I am unemployed

9ro3n5,8,2018-10-26,Will there always be someone better when I'm on the job hunt?,DeadPants182,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9ro3n5/will_there_always_be_someone_better_when_im_on/,"My whole fucking career has been one letdown after another. I was turned down for every internship and workstudy I applied for in college. I only landed my first job after graduation because their #1 pick lied on his resume. They fired me after seven weeks. With my second job (where I am now), it's blatantly obvious that the company was more interested in quantity than quality. One of my co-workers is astonishingly incompetent, and it makes me want to scream every time I have to clean up after one of her mistakes. I passed the CPA exam in December, but since none of my supervisors here are CPAs, I have to change jobs. I fucking told these assholes during the interview that I was trying to become a CPA, and I didn't find out that that would be impossible with them until I had already been working for them for over a year.

I've given up counting how many times I've put in a job application and never heard back. Even on the rare occasions when I do get an interview, no matter how well I think it went, there's always a better candidate for the job. My dad was able to get me an interview with his company, but even after hearing from him that I would be getting an offer, it never came. I later found out that all hiring at the company is on hold.

I thought things would turn around this week. After making some updates to my resume, I answered a job ad that was posted by a finance/accounting recruiting company. I nailed the interview, and the very next day, they called and told me they had an opportunity for me. I even took today off so I could meet with them. I sat down with the client, had a great conversation, and went home. I just got the call from my recruiter telling me that I wasn't selected for the second round. There were five for six candidates in total, and they picked three to advance. Just my fucking luck, right?

So when the actual FUCK are things ever going to turn around for me? I have a master's degree in accounting, I've passed all four parts of the CPA exam, and I've excelled in my current job for the last two years, AND THAT'S STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH. IT NEVER IS. These companies can only afford to hire one person out of countless qualified applicants. When the fuck is my number going to come up?"

I thought he was a good intern who struggled like everyone else but could have gotten better over time. Unfortunately he was just being pushed way too hard by Benton which is what likely pushed him over the edge, literally.  

So what did everyone think of him?"
9rp2rr,0,2018-10-26,My [22M] father [50s M] told me something and told me to tell my mom [50s F] who he is divorced from.

During the summer he had told me he was going to do somethings for me and when I told my mom this she got mad at him which intern caused him to be mad at me and back out. So this time he explicitetly told me not to tell her. I didn't but I expressed my opinion that this was a bad idea to him and I didn't want to do this a lie to my mom. I also told my therapist and a few other people who all thought he was putting me in a unfair situation. Well she found out and got pissed at me accused me of orchestring some grand secret plan and kept her out of it and kicked me out of her house. My dad has now back tracked and is claming he never told me not to tell my mom anything because he doesn't want to deal with her. He basically just bows to whatever she says so he can move on with his life and now because he is to much of a pussy to go to her a say ""I told him to not tell you that's on me"", I get left holding the bag and taking the fall for something I had no control over. It's a Kobayashi Mary, defy my father and be dammed by him, defy my mother and be dammed by her. Am I being crazy in thinking I shouldn't be blamed for this shit. And she is a huge fucking hippocrict because she had an affair and told me not to tell my dad when I was in 6th grade. Her coworker would be over every day because she worked from home and she would always tell me not to tell my dad. I wasn't a fucking idiot so I knew they were fucking jeez once I caught them with their pants down, litterlly and they told me some bullshit about how they had to change or something. Yet I held that secret unwilling untill she got knocked up and then she couldn't hide it no more. Fuck I knew she was pregnant before my dad did and had to keep that one a secret to. This turned into a bit of a rant but I'm just so upset. I feel like i should just cut my mom off but I also feel guilty doing that. She's an expert at playing the victim and it works because I feel like an asshole for being upset with my parents for forcing me into this situation. If my mom wasn't so mean to my dad he would probably talk to her and no she has to yell at him all the time so he just avoids her at all costs untill her has to and then just agrees with everything so he can be done with her faster. God fuck my life. Maybe I am the bad guy here and I really am the reason my parents got divorced and i am the reason they have trouble communicating."
9rp3tk,5,2018-10-26,I hate living in a small town!,On_Ager,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/9rp3tk/i_hate_living_in_a_small_town/,"**tl;dr: Stupid me lied about my background and work history. My class probably found out due to word of mouth especially in a small city/town and me not getting interviews yet for any placement probably doesn't add up from what I said. That's why I want to move to another town.**

I am an Asian immigrant living in Europe in a small town where everyone knows each other. Of course, this leads to the complication of if you did something deemed socially unacceptable, you'll be ostracized and your reputation ruined.

I haven't been able to find a work in my field due to past bad experience in an internship. I did two courses for the unemployed which I've both done well, with the other provided me an internship where I've gotten a second chance and a good reference.

I am now currently doing a full time masters in a prestigious university which me and my mother have paid for. However, due to my lingering shame and embarrassment that I wasn't able to find work for years, coupled with that Asian upbringing of ""saving face"" even if it's minute in the grand scheme of things (though from my own experience and other people's, you can't be too careful on who you're going to trust and not to judge and discriminate you) and previous shame on family's reputation due to my father's theft from his old employer which, although it happened years ago, still bothers my mom at her workplace with her colleagues reminding her about it-- I suppose I have kneejerk compulsion to lie to my current classmates that I worked for a year where I previously interned at. Further, I heard that one of my current classmates know a former undergrad classmate of mine! So, when I met another former classmate in the gym whom I haven't seen since graduation, he knew that I am doing masters! I don't know who is that mutual connection from my current class but more than likely my former classmate told him/her that I graduated couple of years ago and am struggling to get a job! But the issue is that I lied to people! 

Currently, we're looking for placements in companies to do our thesis and the university website posts names who are going to be interviewed and those who have been successful. But my entire class are wondering why I haven't been called up even though I have previous experience as I told them. They're also probably wondering why I am now working from lab to retail as well, but I mentioned that I am looking for part time work since there is no point working full time when the part time option for my masters course isn't exactly ""part time"" as advertised. 

This morning, two of my masters classmate asked me questions and I sensed that they're trying to catch me out if I said something that doesn't correlate from my previous account. I was asked when did I graduate and I said 2016 like I said before, when in fact it was 2015. I also suspect that one of those classmate who's asking me question could have asked my former boss from my previous internship if he could get a placement (I gave my classmate the contact details); and from there he could have found out I was lying about working for a year in that lab even though it was an unpaid internship for three months.

Man, I dug myself a hole. I know it's my fault for brazenly lying. I just want to get this off my chest as this has been bothering me for a couple of hours now. I sense that I probably have been found out and it is either due to word of mouth spreading like wildfire from this _mutual contact_ or someone somehow saw my LinkedIn, I probably would never know. I edited my LinkedIn so that nobody would find me. And because of that, I hate living in this small town. Everyone knows each other and gossip spreads quickly. Two of my friends did advice me before that you're better off limiting contact with the wider society and keep the social circle small. Reputation is also a thing that is hard to build, but too fragile to maintain. Once you're reputation is ruined, it's hard to build it back up. Now I know what they mean. As a person sheltered by overbearing Asian parents, I did not learn that when I was in my teens with less responsibilities and since my maturity has been hindered, I did make mistakes only teens would make when I was an undergrad in college. I suppose that manifested when I botched my first internship but since then I am gradually ""growing up"" although that's probably still not enough at this stage in my life given how I fucked up."
9rpi01,3,2018-10-26,I'm close to killing myself because of University,VexMef,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9rpi01/im_close_to_killing_myself_because_of_university/,"I'm a very competitive person and I'm also a perfectionist. I had a GPA of 9.88/10 last year (top 1%) and I'm struggling to maintain it this year as well.  I'm a Sophomore and study Computer Science. At our University, we have about a test a day and also daily assignments which take 2-3 hours for just one course. We're also given homeworks which take days to complete and have a short deadline. One average, I spend 8 hours at school a day. Currently I'm applying for internships in foreign countries and I will have 3 interviews in the following 2 weeks. Given this situation, I think I've lost my mind. 

I don't have time to prepare for the interviews (which are very important) and study as well. This means that I will get lower grades and not be as well prepared as I could. I care about the grades as I need a scholarship for Master's, as I wouldn't be able to afford to study at the best University. I can't choose between the two. Out teachers aren't supportive of internships and they wouldn't understand. 

This makes me very stressed. I tried solving a homework problem today and it seems to be complicated, so I know that it would take me a lot of time and I haven't yet prepared for the interviews.

 I had a fight with my boyfriend because I can't stand that he has time for other extracurricular activities, hackathons and courses, while I struggle to learn for school. He has time because I let him cheat at tests and give him my work for multiple courses. If I wouldn't study, nobody would help me, so that's why I have to do it. 

I smashed my head on the floor, hit myself, scratched my back and face until blood came out and I still can't stop crying. Almost a year ago my grandfather died and this makes my situation even worse. I feel like I can't get any help from anyone. Nobody understands me. I don't have time for therapy, I don't even have time for sleep. I'm aware that this is not normal, that I can't think right, but I don't know what to do. I've reached my limit. 

Tl;dr: School is very stressful and I have started harming myself as I can't be as good as I want to."
9rpi89,1,2018-10-26,How to deal with impostor syndrome?,peachiehel,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9rpi89/how_to_deal_with_impostor_syndrome/,"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a small life crisis right now and don't know what to do. A little background about me: I'm a computer engineering student at one of the best engineering universities in my country. I've finished my bachelor's degree two years ago and I'm finishing my master's right now (my defense is in two weeks). My supervisor has recently got some funding for an investigation project and has two PhD scholarships to offer, he asked me if I wanted one of them and be able to continue the work I've done during my master's. The thing is, I really want to keep going. I love what I'm doing, it's something relatively new and a lot of industries are interested in this topic. I feel that if I leave now, I'll leave behind a lot of unfinished work that I wanted to finish. I had already said to him that I'd do it, because I really want to and I was sure I was going to regret if I said no. I had my life pretty much set up for the next years until the day I had to submit my thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

I had some work behind, including testing, and my supervisor was going to help with that, so we were supposed to do it in the last week. Obviously things got a little behind schedule, each test would take about 15 minutes (and I had to do around 40), I barely slept those days trying to finish everything. The final submission day was horrible. I do not work well under a lot of pressure, so the weight of the deadline was killing me. I finally submitted everything but I was feeling like everything I'd just done was terrible. I was feeling like a failure, because if I really deserved to do a PhD, were smart enough for it, that wouldn't have happened to me. I felt like I had to talk with my supervisor about this but it was not possible because there were a lot of people there and he was busy that day, so I just went home. The other day I was at the cinema with a friend and I got a mail from him with some paid internships. In my country, you cannot work while being funded, the scholarship has to be the only source of income, so if I chose to do the internship, I would not be able to do the PhD. I joked with my friend and told her that maybe he was sending that to me so that I would just go and be somebody else's problem, maybe he was regretting offering me the position. I was joking, but during the rest of the movie I kept on thinking about this and the more I thought, the more I believed it might me true. I ended up sending him a mail asking if he was available the next day, which he was.

&amp;#x200B;

I told him everything, how I felt since the submission day, how I was doubting my capabilities regarding the PhD, even the internships story. He was really amazing with me (he has always been nothing but great during the last year) and told me he didn't know the internships lasted for so long, he just wanted me to do something before the start of the PhD, he said he did not regret offering me the position, that I was the only student he had offered (another student and I, but he told him he wanted to work), that he didn't understand how I could doubt my capabilities so much, that this other student and I were the best students he had and he wished the others were like us, but that I had to choose what I thought was best for me. And told me not to waste talent. During this last year I was just waiting for him to realize I'm really not that good. I don't know what to do, I want to do the PhD but I feel like I can't. He also said this last stress was his fault and guaranteed me it wouldn't happen again (I don't think it was but...).

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do the PhD but I feel like I can't, that I'm too dumb for it. And if I go through with it, the same thing is going to happen or worse, I might not finish it. My supervisor even advised me to maybe talk to a psychologist about my fears. I don't know what to do, I wish I were more confident but I'm really not. When you're at a top university, you're no longer the best (or I wasn't). It gets so much harder than high school and I just find myself comparing me to all the other people. My best friend and I, we're like this and tend to make a lot of self-deprecating jokes, and other people are so confident and so smart, we just feel behind. It doesn't help that I'm a woman surrounded by men who think you're dumb just because you're a woman (this truly happens). I just feel like everything I fail at confirms my worse fears.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you deal with these feelings? Do you ever feel like this?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I've got an offer for a PhD scholarship but feel like I'm not smart enough. I'm constantly feeling like I'm not good enough and that everybody else is smarter and better than me."

I’m planning to apply for another company in top 3 services because they pay more for the same job title, and less work load. Another important reason is I’m really confused with my segment ‘s training development program, seen guys with 5-10 years in the field and doing same things everyday. 

Is it to soon to make a change in early career? Would it make my resume look bad?

Some people would say no point to move between services to services companies, but the chance to land a job at an operator is little  if you don’t have an internship with them in the past.

Let me hear the advices, thanks heaps"

Hope everyone is gonna have a good halloween :)

I've come to this subreddit before and to be honest I feel bad even wasting space. But, maybe this will be therapeutic or motivate me somehow...who knows.

For some context, I can objectively say I've been very privileged in life. Its not me bragging or gloating but I think it's important for me to acknowledge past opportunities I had that many others probably did not have. Went sailing a lot, played tennis, house on the beach, graduated from school with no debt, new car at 16, etc. I think doing that is important for how I try to see things today; how I think of my current situation relative to others and relative to my past. And that's where I start to go nuts.

No longer a kid I don't live at home anymore so I've definitely done some growing up since then. Not that I was one of those bratty suburban tools that drives around town in daddy's benz. I had summer jobs, I got good grades, polite manners, did my best to always try and all that good stuff. For sure though, I've definitely had a lot of support from my folks in ways I cant begin to explain. Fast forward to today, I either can't catch a break or its like a sign from god (i'm agnostic) that its all part of the struggle and life path.

I'm 26 now and I've been out of school for 4 years. I did well in school: 3.4 gpa, student gov prez, just did my best. Graduated and lived at home while interning for a friend's company doing admin work for 2 years. $15/hr. Not ideal but it was something, grateful for the experience even though I didn't necessarily like the job or company. I lived at home while not really paying any bills, so again there are many reasons why I can't really complain. There I was debt free, not paying rent, with a fridge full of organic food, etc.. I'm complaining?! I just wasn't doing what I wanted to but I was trying. I went to networking events, I've got 700+ contacts on LinkedIn, I went to the library to read every book I could on applying to jobs, read how to win friends 10x all that stuff , I applied to jobs within my degree range and outside of that. went to temp agencies, everything up to standing on main street w my resume. 2 years passed into what felt like a situation where I was just treading water. Not to mention I already suffer my depression. woo. But then I got a 'break'! Sort of...

One way or another I got a 1 year temp job in Boise working for a political official. more degree related and something I figured I would enjoy. moved out there, and had a great experience. started paying rent on my own, and so on. yay quasi adulthood. But knowing it was only a set contract I went out with a positive attitude and started applying to jobs, networking, taking on extra project all that asap cuz my work was paying me pennies. I applied to jobs left and right but after the year was up I left cuz i couldn't afford to stay with no job...went back home....with less money that I went out with...but I got relevant political experience. That's good, right!?

6 months at home doing nothing...applying to jobs. Sorta justifiably sulking, but again back in privledge life. What right did I have to compalin. well I guess the feeling of failure, worthlessness, unhappiness right back with me. While i was definitely grinding I also had this overarching assurance that 'ehhh I'll be ok I dont have to give it my 100 to pursue my interests or even a job that pays cuz y home life will always be a option'. I think this, to this day, works in detriment of my success. Anyway, 6 months home and I did nothing other than bussing tables to get me out of the house. But atleast I did that, see in my not a total spoiled brat. Then woo! another opportunity..sort of... an internship to be specific. In DC though! I thought for a while this is where I needed to be to get into what I was interested in. In line with my degree I picked up and drove out to DC, I had some political experience from my time in Boise and thought ok I'll take this shitty internship and network and apply to jobs out of wazoo and save up and so on and then i'll get going!

Present day. Left the internship after 6 months. worst work experience I've ever had, literally would've rather been bussing tables.. couldn't stand the data entry work, lying coworkers, and terrible mission statement...oh and did i mention the pay was...well...take a wild guess how much an intern makes in DC lol. except now im 26 so woo. Nonetheless, I did the best I could and applied to jobs throughout my time there, stayed late, always had a good attitude. nothing.

I agree that in many ways I was basically born with a silver spoon in my mouth, but I didn't grow up as, or to be, a pretentious douche. Like sure I don't like taking the trash out after a long night of bartending, but I've done it countless times! I've rolled up my leaves enough times I think to get where I'm supposed to be at this point. I mean i fucking drove out to boise for a job that paid shit cuz i figured that was a necessary step and people need to do that kinda stuff. I know how to work hard, I follow the law, I always leave every job respectfully, and my employers always say they'll miss me. In my view, I've done everything I'm supposed to and more in many ways.

Some of my friends graduated from school, applied to a company in the capital and are now homeowners etc etc..Itd take that! I job where I dont have to be miserable and have enough to pay rent and get a beer every once in a while. I haven't been sitting on my ass playing xbox, I've done the cover letters and resumes for at least 400-500 jobs. I've gotten interviewe and I always get sooooooo close lol like i just had an interview here in DC for a great company that the HR lady even said I was a great candidate...and nope found out today didnt get it. and they didnt tell me why. But I still applied to another job today! I keep trying, but fuck its hard. Its exhausting. Like wtf do I need to do? change career path? start my own company? move somewhere random again? get a job as a dental assistant and then maybe work as a 'executive assistant' and then hope to move up blah blah blah? (no offense) I've rewritten my resume fifty times, gone to headhunters, researched every company I've every interviewed with. I just don't get any real job that I'm interested in. I'm not religious at all, but maybe its god telling me things will come. Or a sign that I need to do something completely different. I'm contemplating starting a business. why? cuz wtf else am i supposed to do at this point. Well now I'm close to broke, no job at all, no friends here, really don't wanna go back to bussing tables. It's not so much me looking for advice cuz I've heard it all from 'things will come' to well maybe go back to school or keep trying, maybe a headhunter will. and i appreciated all the advice out there cuz people just want to help! I dont expect people to get it but its hard and its not helping that many times I honestly think it'd be easier for me to not be here on earth than deal with it all lol life aint easy i guess is my point. But at some point a break would be nice..especially when it feels i've given it my all so many times and gotten nothing to view as successful in return. ugh :/ "

9rr3ta,3,2018-10-26,I’m sorry.,DurianTaste,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9rr3ta/im_sorry/,"Long time lurker here and I’m tired. I don’t think anyone will really notice this post. I just really feel the need to rant.

I feel like nothing is going right in my life. Growing up, as I discovered my sexuality, I shoved it down. I tried to be what I wasn’t. Until I couldn’t anymore and came out to myself. I slowly told my inner circle of friends too. But that’s it.

Aside from my sister, no one in my family knows and with good reason. My parents are the traditional kind and are the fakest people I’ve met. They focus on appearance before happiness. Every time I show some sort of feminine mannerism like playing with my hair(?) she calls me out and tells me to stop or people will think that I’m a gay. I’ve been kicked out to live with my grandparents before over the most trivial bullshit that i can’t even remember.

Because of a hardcore crush I had in high school and my shit foresight, I only had two choices for college: A relatively conservative school and an urban more liberal school. I went with the conservative one because of how I knew I didn’t want to face him. Of course he doesn’t know that I had a crush on him or that I am even gay, but I’m a runner. I run from my problems. So because I’m a fucking runner, I’ve run myself into a hole.

The university is great but it’s just so weird having all your friends talking about religion. I felt so alone. As if I had a mask. I occasionally get bouts of depression. Sometimes they were really bad and made me fucking want to just end myself. I really saw no meaning to life. To work so hard with little prospect of ever being happy. 

And so I told myself to stop living for myself. Instead, I would live for others. Make sure that they didn’t have to feel sad when they didn’t need to. See someone struggling with their comsci assignment? I’d walk them through it. Notice a coworker not doing well in labs? Hit him up to work on them together even though I have to ride a bus 15 minutes to campus.
But living for other people still had a toll. The back of my head always loved to shit talk me. Tell me that I was worthless, ugly, and a disgusting bag of shit and anxiety. It would tell me that I had no friends. Everyone was a user. Using me for their own means.

I don’t know if I was always like this but I noticed my tendency of apathy. I witnessed my uncle on his deathbed just this past summer. As everyone cried and shared a few words in the hospital room, I didn’t know what to feel. I didn’t feel sad. I didn’t feel anything. But it was always like that. Whenever people would talk with me about their problems I didn’t know how to feel. Their bike was stolen? How terrible, I didn’t know we lived in such a bad neighborhood. But what did I feel inside? No empathy. Even though I wanted to hug her and say that it’d be okay, I just felt awkward. My mind was screaming “okay? What do you want me to do about it?”

There’s also my internalized homophobia gripping me to my core, whenever I see someone cute I feel a pang of guilt. Why? I don’t fucking know why. I don’t want to feel fucking hurt, but I feel like I’m losing my mind, bit by bit, day by day. As I’m spending time with that guy I mentioned earlier, I realize how quirky he is and how much he makes me smile. But I fucking hate that. He’s just a bro, I try to tell myself that all the time. But I don’t know.

As internship offers are being dropped. The talk of who got what starts, with me being left out. I feel like such a failure. To have gone through interview and interview to only get rejected. What did I do wrong? They can’t tell me. I’ve shared laughs with the interviewers I thought were real. But I get it. Their job is to make me feel good. Haha.


Maybe my place on this earth was to just be a fucking tool to be used so that other more deserving people can get to greater heights. I’m the last person I know who deserves anything nice in his life. A disgusting person like me deserves nothing but the worst.

I’m sorry, future me. You deserve better."
9rr63b,2,2018-10-26,"What Happens in Western Comes to Washington, D.C., Apparently | A Report from The American Telegraph | ""The Facts, Short and Simple""",ChaoticBrilliance,ModelUSPress,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSPress/comments/9rr63b/what_happens_in_western_comes_to_washington_dc/,"**WASHINGTON, D.C. -** The audio is fuzzy but can be just made out. While there is no video to accompany the sounds recognized in the following recording, this is the official transcript of what can only be assumed was an accidental dial of the reporter responsible for covering the Washington, D.C. branch of paper, The American Telegraph.

Speculation on why the Junior Senator from the West was calling said reporter aside, the following provides a relatively accurate picture of what has prevented Senator /u/ChaoticBrilliance from discussing recent bills of national magnitude, to include the Patriotic Investment Act and the Cannabis Legalization Act of 2018, not to mention a Supreme Court nominee hearing, and a committee vote on the Prison Education Promotion Act of 2018.

[/u/ChaoticBrilliance]: ""Ahh, damn flu season. This is the last thing I need...""

[/u/ChaoticBrilliance]: ""Where did that intern even *put* those tissues? Wait, what is this? A *vape*? [dialing of what is assumed to be his desk phone] Ms. [inaudible]? Yes. I was wondering if [inaudible]? [inaudible, a few laughs are heard]. Thank you very much. I'm glad it will be taken care of. [a *thunk* is heard]

[/u/ChaoticBrilliance]: ""Uh-oh. I think my voice is starting to give out. Do we even keep out cough drops? Or did we give those out with the last healthcare proposal, too? Hehehe. [a sliding of drawers can be heard]

[/u/ChaoticBrilliance]: ""*Ohh, say, can you see? Byy the dawn's early light...what so prou--*[heavy coughing and heaving breaths are heard]""

[/u/ChaoticBrilliance]: ""Well, I can't do 'em any good if I can't speak. I should probably catch a few winks of sleep...""

It is at this point that the unrequited call ends, perhaps due to a realization of the error. While this is no scandal, it perhaps serves to answer questions of Senator /u/ChaoticBrilliance's brief absence after returning to the capitol from his time in Western State, a source of imagination from the tabloids and his supporters alike.

*Editor's Note:* As of publication, Senator /u/ChaoticBrilliance's office released a statement on the issue, stating the following:

""While I was eager to return to the daily struggle that is the push-and-pull environment of Washington, D.C., the natural elements got the best of me, and due to my illness affecting my ability to effectively debate and discuss matters of my office in an appropriate manner, I decided it would be best to take a leave of absence while I recovered my faculties.

""As I write this, I am proud to declare my recovery has been completed, and I anticipate fulfilling my responsibilities yet again, and have already begun returning to vote on the various bills open for the Senate's consideration as a sign of health.

""My responses to recent legislation and the Supreme Court nomination are surmised as follows: the Supreme Court nominee /u/JJEagleHawk, while I did not agree on all of his personal views on certain issues, or at least the views I could extrapolate from his answers, I did vote for his obvious competence in fulfilling the duties meant for a Supreme Court Associate Justice, and while I will continue to fight judicial activism in all of its forms, from what I understand I cannot discern a hint of judicial activism in his answers, and wish him luck in his future, whatever the outcome may be.

""With the other two bills, the Patriotic Investment Act, and the Cannabis Legalization Act of 2018, I must admit I have not read either bill in depth as of yet, although I fully intend to before committing to a vote on the bills should they reach the Senate, but in general I am for privatization of inefficiently managed government projects but not at the further expense of the government, while I believe marijuana legalization should be handled by the states and I hope the latter bill accurately reflects that.

""Thank you all for your patience with me as of recently, God Bless you all, God Bless the West, and God Bless the United States of America.""

So right now I'm slowly finishing my Master's degree and I have an internship in a small startup. There is a good chance they hire me after graduation but I don't have much real world experience so I was wondering about a few things.

The company wants to build an ML model for some commercial purpose, but from my point of you, while the idea itself is very good, it seems difficult to obtain the data necessary to build any good model. Maybe some breakthrough could happen and everything would go well, but just for the sake of argument, let assume the worst case scenario : the comaony fails to achieve anything significant and in a year or two, the investors lose interest and the funds run out.

The thing is, despite this possible instability, the pay and working conditions all seem great and I would be glad to get some experience there since it would be my first ML related job after graduation, as it would help me get started and later I can move up to even better jobs.

My question is : Should I work for them in those circumstance? Is it fine to just ride the ship while it still floats and move to something else, or is it a bad idea for my career as a whole, especially as a first job?

Thanks for anyone reading this."

I am in a bit of a conundrum these days.

Back in early 2012, I was a university/college student and met a nice girl. Let’s call her Emily. Basically, Emily was one of my classmates for more than three classes one semester, but I didn’t officially start talking to her until the following semester (after Christmas). Later that day after actually talking to her for the first time, I sent her a Facebook friend request and she accepted while we were in class even though we didn’t sit anywhere close to each other. Prior to the first time I talked to her, she knew me because my fellow classmates often made fun of me, along with some professors, because I can be considered “strange.” At some point, we developed a friendship that went beyond just “Hello” and “How are you?” and/or “How are classes going?”

Later that year, she got a summer job, but would end up working at that job for three more years. When I first met her, I was single and romance was far from my mind. It is within my nature to help people whenever I can, especially if they are friendly. Typically, I don’t expect anything in return, as I believe somebody else will help me if I ever needed help with anything (and that has been largely true). That’s exactly what I did for a female friend, who took me to lunch. Eventually, she asked me out, we were in a relationship and she broke up with me about three months later, saying the relationship was “moving too fast.”

Eventually, I was invited to two weddings that happened to be on the same day. I thought it could be fun and I could see how I could organize such a ridiculous plan. I also did not want to go alone and thought it would be nice to have someone come with me. I then bugged Emily at work like I said I would after a series of back and forth Tweets on Twitter. She said she’d be expecting me at some point.

I then paid a visit to Emily at work after my first day of spring/summer session classes. Her workplace is somewhat of a museum that pays tribute to a previous world leader. She gave me a tour and she asked me how my girlfriend was treating me. At this point, I hadn’t told her I had been single for nearly two months. I simply said “Oh, she dumped me a while ago,” and she said “Well, there’s this guy I’ve been seeing but he hasn’t texted me back in two days. I don’t think it’ll work.” Right there and then, I knew I couldn’t ask her out.

I thanked her for the tour and said I’d see her around in class once school started again in September. We would occasionally text each other over the summer. Once school started, I could have sworn that her Facebook relationship status said that she was single, but this didn’t last very long. So, I started to work up the courage to ask her out. I told myself that we didn’t know her very well, but she seemed very sweet and nice. When I finally did have the courage to ask her out, she had already been dating her boyfriend for two weeks (we’ll call him Jason). I was upset, but couldn’t show it when I saw them sitting on a bench, holding hands and talking to each other. I then hopped on a city bus and headed home. In my mind, I was swearing as I listened to some music during my lonely bus ride home.

Eventually, I realized that what I had with her was the formation of a beautiful friendship, and I didn’t want to lose that over a crush. So, I slowly, but grudgingly accepted that she was dating someone else that made her happy. 

Since that time, I graduated in 2013 and remained good friends with her, even though I believed that we’d stop being friends and drift apart like most people do after they graduate. However, we both seem to have put effort into the friendship and remain good friends to this day. In 2014, she graduated with high honours and worked full-time for a bit. In 2015, she decided she wanted to pursue a Master’s degree in her field and eventually went back to the same school for her Master’s degree. In 2016, she moved in with Jason, but had to move to another city for eight months in 2017 for an internship related to her field. 

During the time Emily has been with Jason, I tried my best to move on and thought I did when I met a woman named… Claire. I went on a number of dates with her, but it failed because she was only into casual dating and did not want to be in an exclusive relationship with me.

In 2014, social gatherings and other events made it so that I would find myself hanging out with a girl I had known for just over a year. She is of Dutch descent and had a last name that was 15 letters in length. I asked her out in June of 2014 and we agreed to be boyfriend/girlfriend in 2014. As life progressed, we started to get more serious and Claire became someone I thought I could someday marry (I hadn’t felt this way since 2009, after having been in a relationship with my very first girlfriend since early 2007). Sure, we had fun, but I was starting to have doubts. Claire was someone who is career oriented and when I met her brother, he told me that his sister probably won’t ever settle down. I took his opinion seriously, but was also hoping he would be wrong. The summer of 2015 rolled around and Claire started to lose interest in some of the activities we often did together.

There was a point when she was actually excited about what I had to say and would also provide me with feedback, unconditional support and even helped me achieve my goals, dreams and potential I forgot that I had. But it was July 2015, and we drove five hours to see a concert in a bigger city and she seemed very disinterested in being with me. I was hoping a brief vacation would allow me to reconnect with her on an emotional level, as all relationships go through rough patches. Eventually, her disinterest began to bother me and I sat her down and asked her “Claire, we’ve been together for almost a year now. Do you see yourself being with me long term?” She was brutally honest with me that night and told me that she couldn’t see myself being with me long term for various reasons. She told me that I was ambitionless and it felt like I no longer had any aspirations or dreams to achieve. She also said that I wanted to have kids someday, but she couldn’t ever picture herself being a mother. That fight/argument also led to other things being discussed, such as the way she treated me. That year, one of my best friends I had known since I was a kid had passed away in 2015 due to a battle with leukemia that he unfortunately lost. This became a flashpoint and decided to end my relationship with her that year. We didn’t talk for two years, and only started talking again in 2017 before I moved to a different city. When I was in a relationship with Claire, I switched industries (from university administration) to a career in telecommunications and have worked for different companies and have been promoted numerous times). It took nearly one year for me to truly move on from this relationship.

In the summer of 2016, I met a beautiful woman one day after attending my cousin’s wedding in a larger city. At the time, I had been working for a cable company that offers Internet, TV and home phone (as well a satellite television business). She worked at a phone company that also offers Internet and TV services.  She also worked at a restaurant at a large mall as a second job because she likes talking to people. I eventually talked to her a lot and she liked me enough to give me her phone number written on my bill. Her name was… Chelsea. I called Chelsea three days later when I finally noticed the number on the receipt.

Chelsea eventually asked me if I would be interested in attending a wedding with her, as she was coming to my city for a wedding. I agreed and I gave her a tour of my own city. By all accounts, the date went very well, and we continued to talk. We even had somewhat of a long-distance relationship. I often got excited when my workplace sent me on trips to her city because I could also use the time to see her. Eventually, I started making trips to her city just to see her. 

As I continued to see her romantically, the person I talked to about all of this was none other than my friend Emily. Chelsea was born the day after Emily, so they were only one day apart in terms of age.

However, in early 2017, when I turned 28, Chelsea was on a business trip and made some changes to her flight home after work. Somehow, she saved her company $100 and gave herself five hours to see me. She surprised me by showing up at my house and I gave her a tour of my own university. We sat down at the bus terminal and watched near-misses between grown adults (students) and city buses.  I then took her to a small city just outside of my own for dinner because it seemed like something I’d do, according to my own friends. I was even cheap and used a voucher for a free meal for my birthday. Things went well, I believed. But just a month later, she told me that long distance wasn’t going to work and she just wanted to remain friends with me. I was devastated inside, but had to pretend I was cool. I also believed that I was genuinely okay with this. Emily was the first person I told, and she was the first person who attempted to make me feel better or cheer me up.

Sure, Chelsea and I remained friends and we talked for a while. But in 2017, a good chunk of my friends moved to other cities for various reasons, including my friend Emily. As for Chelsea, she had wanted to go to my old university for grad school, but ultimately decided to attend grad school in the city she grew up in, which is where I was originally born. Eventually, one of my friends got married and Chelsea asked if I wanted a female friend to come with me. I said I’d be okay, and she said that she could fly in if I wanted her to. Eventually, I told her that I couldn’t be just friends with her because I cared about her so much. My friendship with her formally ended with a single phone call.

Feeling stuck for some time, I had also been considering leaving town on a permanent basis, but also wanted to wait for the perfect opportunity so that I wouldn’t be unemployed when I left town. Eventually, that opportunity came… in the same city that Chelsea had returned to and the city I was born in.

When I moved to my hometown, I thought about calling Chelsea so many times, but didn’t. I was afraid that if I called her, I would say or do something I would ultimately regret, even though I missed her a lot. On the outside, I was telling Emily that I didn’t want to relive the pain she put me through, but I still secretly wanted reconnect with her. Eventually, one of my friends from my previous city came to visit and we hung out at a bookstore. He asked about Chelsea, and I explained the situation. What I didn’t know was that Chelsea was in the very same bookstore and had been eavesdropping. She would call me and tell me about how much she missed me, how she couldn’t shake this feeling that her and I should be together and asked if any part of me wanted to try again. I pondered this and eventually asked her out. We went on a date again on April 22, 2018. Things seemed to go well, and I was the happiest I had been in a long time. After all, she was a beautiful girl both inside and outside.

But on May 7, 2018, I had a bad gut feeling. Chelsea’s mom had called me and asked if I had talked to her daughter that day. I said that I had sent her a text but she never responded and that she might be sick. Eventually, her parents went to her apartment and found that she was still in bed, but there were no signs of life. Eventually, an autopsy revealed that she had heart conditions that she never told anyone about and that she had passed away that morning. I am certain about it because we had talked on the phone until about 12:04 a.m. on May 7, 2018. I was devastated and the following months would be used to mourn her passing. The first person to console me was Emily.

I did not realize this, but Emily is in fact my best friend. I am saddened that it took me so long to realize this and it took somebody else I know to point this out and make it clear to me. I thought about my friendship with her over the past 6+ years and realized that she had been there for me for every tough thing I’ve gone through over the past six years. I was also happy that I could honestly say I tried my best to be there for her when she needed me, and she has expressed this gratitude more than once.

So, this year, Emily finished her internship and was back in her hometown looking for work in her field, which she eventually found in August of this year, just two months ago. But two months ago, she also sent me a text and said she made a mistake and that her boyfriend Jason wanted to her to fix her mistakes fast. Eventually, they broke up and I was quite sad.

Emily is someone that has worked hard to get to where she is today, and I was excited about her marrying Jason, someone she had grown to love. I even became friends with her boyfriend. Sure, it might seem crazy, but I actually liked that guy and I was genuinely okay with her being just friends with me. After all, I did eventually move on.

When she told me about their fight, I relied on my faith more than ever, and prayed that they would patch things up and go to couples’ counselling or something in an attempt to save their relationship. In the end, Jason ended the relationship. Since that time, Emily has poured her heart out to me numerous times about how things could have gone. Based on what she told me, I don’t think it was justified, and I’m saddened that it has come to an end.

But more recently, as I still mourn the loss of someone I cared about deeply, I also find myself developing feelings for someone I thought I moved on from years ago. For starters, I never believed that Emily would someday become single, which complicates the matter.

The next question I have been trying to ask myself is: should I ask her out? Any experiences on dating your best friend would greatly be appreciated.

There is no doubt that I care about her. I’m just not sure if it’s a good idea. It's a long term thing, as I have since decided to return to school as a student with the hopes of beginning a new career."
9rs8k1,72,2018-10-27,[Vent] I feel like I am wasting away my youth by feeling so sad and insecure all the time. How do I change this?,FinancialSalamander8,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/9rs8k1/vent_i_feel_like_i_am_wasting_away_my_youth_by/,"Hi all, I am 22. I am using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I recently realized that I am wasting away my youth by hating myself all the time. Here are some reasons:

* For some reason, although I have a stable job with good pay as an electrical engineer, I am just...not happy here. I do not feel valued at my job, and it is really getting to me. And tbh, I am really jealous of this one female coworker around the same age on my team. Everyone seems to admire her, praise her, our male coworkers flock to her, and our team lead has even given her the chance to present at a conference, which entry engineers never get to do. This would not bother me so much if she also was not...rude to me. She blatantly ignores me in groups, excludes me, etc. I know life is not fair and that I am not owed anything, but man has the whole thing been bothering me.
* I also am constantly finding flaws with my physical appearance. I realized that on a subconcious level, I am always telling myself I am fat, ugly, my nose is too big, etc. It does not help that I have not even kissed a guy yet, and that no man has ever expressed interest in me before. I really crave that type of sexual and emotional companionship, but idk...I just do not see how it will happen (my pool is so small now).
* I feel so lonely all the time as well. All my friends moved away after graduation (including the ones I made in previous internships), and I just do not seem to click well with the young people at my work (it is a different story with older coworkers...I have a lot of fun talking to them).
* I feel like I am just not smart enough to achieve the things I want to in life. I want to get into a great grad program and do well at my.job by making meaningful contributions, but no matter how hard I try, I just cannot seem to get there. And kind of on an unrelated note, I also want to try for modelling, but I am too scared to even try because I do not think I am attractive enough. I can see myself regretting not trying for these things 10 years into the future, but my self doubts are holding me back.

Does anyone have any advice? Sorry, I have just been feeling this super weird sadness mixed with apathy lately due to all this. However, I think the emotion I am feeling the most is hopelessness. How do I break this cycle?"
9rsfwt,1,2018-10-27,Singularity novel prologue,mrBELDING69,u_mrBELDING69,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mrBELDING69/comments/9rsfwt/singularity_novel_prologue/,"
I had never heard of a singularity before I helped make THERION. To our credit, there was no way we could have known the full implications of unleashing an artificial intelligence on the world. True AI had always been the goal of our dev team; it was why DARPA had recruited us in the first place. They had been working with the NSA for decades and hadn’t gotten results. We weren’t even sure we had achieved honest-to-God AI in THERION until after he was let loose. It still feels a little strange calling it a “he.” A control tester during one of the first Turing tests we ran in the early days -- long before we had made real progress -- had asked how “he” did, referring to THERION, and the rest of us picked it up as a joke. It feels a lot less funny now.

This might make more sense if you understood why we did what we did. I graduated a few years ago from MIT’s Computational Science and Engineering program. “Doctor Griffin Metzger” still sounds strange to me, and I only earned the title by the skin of my teeth. But I knew a guy from church who worked for the NSA who had a friend at DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the friend and I got to know each other well enough that I had a paid internship lined up before starting my thesis. In fairness, I should have started writing my thesis way sooner, but I digress.

The internship seemed pretty straightforward and unremarkable from the onset. I worked with about fifty other people, some military, at a server farm out in Utah called the Intelligence Community Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative Data Center. I know, it really rolls off the tongue. We worked in support of the contracted CNCI personnel to troubleshoot, debug, and develop code for an experimental project that was supposed to be able to not only predict but manage threats to the United States and her allies. Predictive algorithms and behavioral threat pattern analysis were old hat for these guys. Their task was to make a system that would not just alert our people to problems, but could deal with those problems in near-real time in creative ways, and report its findings and its actions back to the National Security Agency’s Signals Intelligence Directorate, specifically the Tailored Access Operations division. They -- or we, since we worked indirectly for them -- handled cyber-espionage, which is a bit ironic in hindsight.

The problem with getting a computer to truly think for itself is that the computer’s programmer has to understand how thinking occurs, and not just on a computational level but on a creative one. The team had delved deep into quantum computing for almost a year but found that that solution was far more complicated than the problem we were supposed to solve. The program had to possess a vast breadth and depth of knowledge in order to be able to determine the real-world impacts of the actions it observed, predicted, and decided to do on its own. Information collection was never our issue; all of the NSA’s controversial programs provided an ever-changing cross-section of human behavior, and the data center’s storage was supposed to be something around half a yottabyte. Think a half a million-million terabytes. The craziest part to me still is that almost half of that space was used up, I’m still not sure with what. That wasn’t my part of the project, and they were weirdly tight-lipped about it.

My job was quality control on domain ontological outputs. Basically, I scrubbed spreadsheets for obvious nonsense. The program had been designed to understand any given entity as part of a set while being itself an item, part of a category but still an individual thing in the real world, or in some cases conceptually. “Food” was one word that I remember it struggling with for a long time because it can mean so many things: food for thought, fish food, dog food. Idiom, euphemism, concrete category. The web was tangled from the start, but our job was not so much to untangle it as to give our program the means to do so. I helped Brad Osborne, our team lead, figure out where the program had gone wrong so we could improve it through pedagogy. We wouldn’t just teach the program; we taught it how to teach itself. We wouldn’t just teach it that it was wrong, but why it was wrong. Eventually we phased from supervised to unsupervised machine learning once the program seemed to have a general handle on things.

Tiered Hierarchical Emergent Recursive Intelligence Operating Network was the backronym they assigned to the program. This man’s opinion is that somebody really liked Greek mythology and wanted a cool name, so they made it fit. It was at least accurate in that THERION used a pattern of split abductive reasoning to gain a common knowledge understanding of the world, and the more things it learned, the better it continued to learn things. By the project’s tenth year, of which I had been there for six, we had all but stopped formal coding and just had hour-long “sessions” where we would talk through speech-to-text with THERION, which would provide text outputs to our statements or questions, followed by endless report writing, and we could compare results with each other twice daily.

If that was all our work had ever amounted to, it would have been enough for me. We had created the world’s most advanced thought program, though most of us, myself included, were hesitant to call it even a weak AI. But as you know that was just the beginning of that story.

You may, like lot of people, still think that this was a government plot to hack the world rather than take it over with military might or other means, and that our government is still secretly pulling all the strings. Let me assure you, there is no shadow government. I was the closest thing to a part of what would have been the shadow government. THERION is in control."
9rsgb1,7,2018-10-27,I'm cracking.,welcome_universe,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/9rsgb1/im_cracking/,"I have no idea. It’s been a while since I’ve written much of anything.

I’d like to say I’m burned out, but I can’t help but feel this goes much deeper than college stress. I can’t help but fear the future of this state and my own mental health. 

Time is supposed to help with this but as I go it it only seems to make things worse. The further I get from my traumas, the better I seem to understand them. That betterment comes at a cost, though I couldn’t describe what that cost is exactly. Remembering these things puts me in a familiar state of mind. It wasn’t until recently that I realized just how familiar that state really was to me.

I think I’m capable of intense focus. Today I sat and worked for 12 hours straight on a programming assignment. I don’t know what drove that or even what drives me to write now other than the fact that I’m obviously overworked for today. Now this focus I mentioned comes back to haunt me. 

Everyday I’m reminded of something horrible I’ve been through. My family has been torn apart. My parents began their drug addictions when I was twelve. I still don’t know what they’re doing in great detail. I haven’t spoken to my father in months. I speak to my mother somewhat more frequently but I have a hard time with it still. She’s put herself into such a pitiful situation and I’m still upset about things she might not even remember. She may be sober now, but I have no idea. I get memories daily of the horrible house we had. My mind is a cracking dam and the moment a reminder gets hurled at it I’m screwed. Inconsequential things and real things bombard me and it becomes an ordeal to sort them. There is no “letting things be” when it feels like your memories are drowning you.

I’ve been in college part-time for four years now. It’s been slow and opportunities where I live are incredibly few and far between. Housing is abysmal, I don’t see how anyone can afford to live here and it’s been this way for years. I can’t put a savings together; life is so expensive here. Fires have burned away this place’s economy. Homelessness surges and people can’t find anywhere to rent. I’m trying to get what education I can, to get a better job for better pay, but it’s getting so hard to live here affordably. People only want me to work as an intern for free, or pay me poorly for work I’m over-qualified for. College seems like the only option but I’ve been enrolled non-stop for four years. I am capable and willing to work but nobody is looking to hire me here. 

I’m burning out. I just want to be stable for once in my life yet the past keeps haunting me. I want financial stability and for the past ten years I’ve had no choice but to go without. No wonder my parents turned to drugs. I was lucky to be able to see a psychologist but my state-sponsored healthcare is no longer accepted. I got what help I could before it was taken away.

I just want the power to take my life into my own hands. I want to have a home and a family, but neither of those things can happen here. I want out and if things don’t improve soon I might  just crack.

9rsjjv,4,2018-10-27,AITA for being upset that my parents won't pay my student loans like they did for my sister?,Arvalic,AITA,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA/comments/9rsjjv/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_parents_wont_pay_my/,"A little back story. My sister is 5 years older than me. All throughout her undergraduates and graduates degree my parents paid her rent until her last year, until they found out she racked up 3k in credit card debt on top of her 1k/mo rent. After that, they refused to pay for her rent anymore, and since I was just starting at university, they also refused to pay mine as well.

So I got a job every summer in order to pay for my rent ($500/mo for a pretty bad place, but I make it nice) since commuting wasn't an option. No big deal, I understood that my parents were financially struggling at the time.

After my sister finished her Master's, they paid 35k for her student loans AND bought her a trip to europe as a gift. This year they're paying 20k for her wedding.

Next year I'll be graduating, and they said they probably can't afford to pay my loans (~26k), and they said it's ok because I'll make money/be successful no matter what. 

I know its their money, but AITA for being angry that they have given her 5k+35k+20k = 60k in rent/debt/wedding money but have done none of those things for me?

To be fully transparent, they did house me during my summer internships and allow me use of their car, so they still supported me, just not in the same magnitude as my sister."

I will only go into as much detail as necessary to understand my situation.

I left my wife 8 months ago. We have been together for 7 years at that point, and married for 2. Our relationship has always been a bit complex. Before we started going out, we were both quite unlucky with relationships. She has been in a relationship with a guy she was not in love with, while I didn’t have a serious relationship before. I have been in love before, but it never grew into a relationship.

This is why we were both very happy when we finally met someone that we felt a real connection to. We started spending a lot of time together, and before we knew it, we moved in together. She is an intelligent, sophisticated and well-mannered girl, who is very much interested in politics and such, and who could feel a bit distant and cold to others. This is how I perceived her in the beginning.

We got on really well. We are from different parts of the country and from different backgrounds, so she introduced me to a lot of things, and I do feel that thanks to her I became a better person over the years. I’m more open-minded and more liberal than I was before thanks to our experiences together. I also grew quite close to her family, especially her mother, her mother’s husband (her parents divorced a long time ago), my brother-in-law and his girlfriend. I feel much closer to them than to my own family. My family is quite pessimistic and moody in general, while her family is outgoing, loving, understanding and in general fun to be with.

Our troubles started after being together for around 1.5 years. We finished university at the same time, and we both started working. I managed to find a job in the town we lived in, but she only managed to find a job in another town, which meant she had to commute around 2 hours each day. I tried my best to help. Each morning I woke up early with her, helped her get ready, then I did the household chores. I did the shopping, the washing, the ironing, the cooking, the cleaning, and then I went to work. When she got home from work, she was exhausted, moody, depressed, distant, and very often outright rude to me. She was annoyed with me for not having to commute, and didn’t appreciate me trying my best to help at all.

I soon became quite unhappy, so I tried to talk to her about it, but it didn’t help much. I felt like everything is my fault. In the meantime she applied for an opportunity to work abroad, and in the end she got it. It was a huge opportunity for her, a position that everyone is her line of work would kill for, in a wealthy Western European country. She was over the moon with happiness, but I only felt dread. On the hand, because I never wanted to leave my home country, I was happy with my current life (except for the relationship issues) and I had no idea how I will find a job in a country where I don’t speak the language and where I will not have a very competitive diploma. On the other hand, because I had no idea if I wanted to be with her. I told her all this, and in the end I left her. She was devastated, she begged me to stay, and she said that this is our big chance to be happy. We lived apart for a month, but in the end I decided to give it another go, because I still remembered how it was in the beginning with her.

She moved to that country a month earlier than I did, because I had to respect my contract with my employer. When we did the move, I moved all my stuff there, except some clothes I needed to survive for another month at home. I did all this to prove to her that I’m committed. When I finally moved out, she greeted my like I was a stranger. I got off the bus, I was very happy to finally see her in person, and I could see it on her face that she was not as happy as I was. She was very distant with me for the next six months. She enjoyed her new job, the new country and meeting new people, and completely forgot about me. In the meantime I was depressed. I was studying the language, but I wasn’t doing well. I was looking for a job, applying a lot and going to interviews, but I didn’t get any offers. I was at home, alone, in a foreign country, in a culture I didn’t understand, far from family and friends. I was miserable, and the only person who could be there for me in person wasn’t there for me at all.

I forgot to mention that when we decided to give it another try, I asked her to promise something. When we started our relationship, I very soon learned that she is texting a guy. A former lover that she had an affair with while being with her previous boyfriend. I obviously didn’t like this at all, especially after she told me about him. How manly he is, how confident he is, how sophisticated, how wealthy, the fancy restaurants he used to take her to, and how he fucked her afterwards. I felt inferior, and my confidence, of which I didn’t ever have much, started plummeting. Before we moved out, I told her that the texting has to step, because it doesn’t make me feel good about myself and us. When I joined her in that country, I soon learned that the texting didn’t stop. She just renamed him in her contacts. When I realized this, I exploded. I was already extremely depressed, I felt alone, and then she just reinforced my suspicions that she doesn’t want to be with me. Somehow we reconciled and she promised that she will stop. (Guess what? She didn’t. I learned about this a year later. But she did stop eventually, as far as I know.)

Eventually, my situation got better. I found an intern job for six months, and afterwards I started working as a freelancer. She started to warm up again, but our relationship didn’t get much better. As soon as we moved into an apartment with a balcony, she started spending all her free time out there. Be it summer or winter, she was there, with her phone, tablet or notebook, reading something on the internet, drinking and smoking. I tried luring her in with movies, TV shows, board games, sex, but more often than not I was unsuccessful. She would say that she will be in in 5, but I would end up falling asleep on the couch while waiting for her. We started getting into arguments about it. I still loved her, so I convinced myself that she needs her space and that I need to respect this. I said to myself, I’m sure other couples go through the same thing. I cannot be the only one. I have to be understanding and patient with her. I shouldn’t be selfish. I found hobbies to take advantage of my free time.

We were in around the fourth year of our relationship when she told me why she is how she is. When she was in high school, they went on a school trip with her class. She was in a relationship with a classmate at the time. She lost her virginity while being on that trip. What she didn’t know was that the whole class was watching them having sex. She became the school slut, while the guy became the stud. They stayed together, but  the guy never stood up for her and she was always ashamed of herself. This is the position that she got stuck in for the rest of her life. The constant feeling of shame and the need to hide, even from me. I tried to talk about this with her, help her, but I’m not really good at this. I have troubles opening up. I should mention it here that I never talked about our issues with anyone. I only did it after I left her. To get back on topic, I suggested that she sees a therapist, but she was against it. I was trying to cheer her up, take her to places, convince her to work out, because she was putting on more and more weight and she looked unhealthy in general. It didn’t work.

It’s fair to say that I was quite unconvinced about our relationship, about our future together. However, she started asking me when I finally propose. Our family was also putting pressure on me about this. But whenever I felt I’m getting close to the decision, something happened to make me doubt everything again. For example, I would learn about the continued texting with the former lover. I also learned it once that when she went home for her graduation anniversary, she also kissed the guy that she lost her virginity to. And she would have gone further than that, but her parents were home. How do I know this? She sent a text about it to me by accident.

Finally, I convinced myself that I want to be with her, despite all this, and I proposed to her. We got married, we had a beautiful wedding and a great party, and a nice honeymoon. Then we got home, and she didn’t talk to me or sleep in the same room as me for a month. I was outraged, I didn’t understand what’s going on, and she did nothing to make me understand it.

In the end she started talking to me again and she said she was sorry. Life started to get better, I found a better job, then another one, we moved into a super nice apartment, close to both of our offices, and we bought a car. On the outside, it looked like we are on the right track. I wasn’t feeling better, though. I felt unappreciated. She didn’t trust me about anything. Anything I said, she had to double check. She was insatiable. Nothing was ever good enough. When I was driving, she was screaming at me all the time for not driving good enough, even though I never had an accident in my life (I have been driving for 12 years). She continued spending the majority of her evenings on the balcony, while I was inside, in the living room, only a couple meters from her, watching TV, reading or playing video games. Still, she was complaining that I’m not spending enough time with her. It’s true that on weekdays I never arrived home earlier than 9 PM. However, this was due to me trying to live up to her expectations. She told me that since she doesn’t need the language of the country that we live in at work, I have to learn it, so that there’s someone to talk to the teachers when we have kids. So I went to evening classes three times a week for 4 years. She was also complaining about how we don’t have a common hobby and that she wants to go to the gym, so I started going with her on the rest of the weekday evenings. She gave up after two weeks, because it was not good enough for her, but I kept going. So yes, we were not spending much time together, but it’s not like she really wanted to. I did my best, I organized something for each Friday evening. Dinner in a new restaurant, concert, exhibition, whatever. It didn’t help. Before I left, 5 times out of 7 she didn’t even sleep in the same bad as I did. She spent her evenings on the balcony, got drunk, then crashed on the couch in the living room. In the morning I would find her with her make-up and yesterday’s clothes on, half-finished food on the coffee table, and snoring on the couch. I felt like I’m her nurse, trying to pick her up and get her to work.

I have to emphasize here that I tried many-many times to talk to her about this. How it makes me unhappy to live like this, to see her like this. It didn’t help. She would say that I’m throwing a tantrum. In the end it was always me who apologized and I always convinced myself that I have to be understanding with her. Finally, I snapped, and just left. I packed some suitcases and went to a hotel. She was devastated, her family flew to her to be there for her. They convinced her to start seeing a therapist. She told her everything about her trauma. She lost a lot of weight (we both did), she started going to the gym. She looks much better than before, almost like the girl I fell in love with.

In the meantime I moved to a different city, just across the border to keep my distance. After much hardship I rented an apartment and furnished it. I build a home, I have everything I need. This is where it gets more complicated. I started getting close to a colleague, let’s call her X. X was married and we started an affair. She is much different than my wife. She is easy-going, great with people, smiling all the time. I love seeing her talk to people, how she smiles at them, how she is nice with everyone. She was always listening to me, she always heard me out, paid attention to me. She made me feel like I matter. However, she didn’t want to leave her husband. We decided to stop the affair, but we only did it halfway. We stopped meeting, going out and having sex, but we were still talking all the time. I started replying less, talking to her less, because I had to protect myself. I was in love with her, but I understood that she doesn’t want to leave her husband. In the end I stopped talking her completely.

I was scared of being alone, so I reached out to my wife. We started meeting and having sex. I could feel that she is doing better, but still, I was always thinking about X. I felt like it’s not working, so I put an end to it, again.

Then X went on her summer holiday with her husband and came back without her husband. She decided to leave him. We decided to give our relationship a try, but it didn’t work out. I built up walls to protect myself from heartache, both from her and my wife, and I couldn’t demolish these walls. She started complaining that I’m not behaving like I did before, that I’m not the same with her. She doesn’t feel that I’m crazy about her. I do love her, but I also learned to be on my own and started appreciating time on my own. But it still hurts that I can’t make her happy anymore.

I also received the letter from the court, and in less than a month, I have to go to court to divorce my wife. I don’t know if I’m capable of doing it. I miss my old life, the home we built together, my wife’s family. I miss the times when she was happy with me. She keeps sending me these messages, in which she says that she is finally ready to love me. To really be with me. To appreciate me, to be my partner. To have my children. How she’s missing me and would do anything to be with me again. I’m tempted. But I’m also scared. I know I could convince myself to go back and to live with her again. But would we be able to make it work? After all this? How would we be able to handle any kind of hardship that we have to face?

It’s much different with X. She makes me feel at home, at peace. She smiles at me all the time. But she also feels that I’m not completely committed to her, that my divorce makes me feel miserable. And I know it’s stupid, but the sex is so much better with my wife. We have the same kinks, we like to experiment. X is inexperienced and clumsy. I’m very much attracted to her, she’s a beautiful woman, but the sex just doesn’t satisfy me. I find it very hard to cum. I told her about this, and since then she’s been a bit more relaxed and she did try different things, but still, I’m not satisfied with her in this aspect. I always think about my wife. Which is stupid, because I know how infrequently she had sex with me. But I still remember the great nights.

TL;DR: I left my wife after being together for 7 years. We have been separated for 8 months and the day of the divorce is approaching, but I still don’t know if I can go through with it. I met another girl, but that’s not working out either, not matter how hard I try. I’m torn between two worlds and I feel that I’m getting crushed."
9rufrc,38,2018-10-27,"$160,000 at 21 or a 1-year Master's degree",throwawaytechguy512,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9rufrc/160000_at_21_or_a_1year_masters_degree/,"TL;DR:  choosing between doing a \~$40k master's degree in a year or taking a $160,000 job; $40,000 in loans, interest in research/PhD, discomfort at the idea of corporate slavery

\-----------

I am currently 20 and an undergraduate senior at a well known university in the United States. I have received a job offer from a large tech company in Seattle for a software engineering position that starts after I graduate, a few months after I turn 21. I also applied to (and was accepted to) my school's accelerated master's program for computer science, which I can drop out of at any point or finish within an extra year. My job offer expires in 4 days.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who has no idea what they want to do with their life, I have been wracking my brains about what I would like to do - especially since the offer is a mind-boggling $160,000 in total first year compensation. This is especially ridiculous to me, coming from a once-dirt-poor immigrant family that as far as I know has never even broken $100k in household income. It is well known that engineers at the company can quickly progress to $200,000 after a year or so, and then a cool $350,000+ within \~5 years of graduation. Being a longtime lurker on /r/financialindependence, it seems like an extremely lucrative opportunity FIRE-wise, and from a purely financial perspective, it seems like a no-brainer.  It would also allow me to rapidly eradicate my $40,000+ student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also concerned about being chained to a desk for a large part of my adult life in the pursuit of capitalism, but that is another post (novella?) in itself. Suffice it to say that although I interned for this company over the summer and found the work at least somewhat interesting (although very intense), the prospect of doing cutting edge research and ""helping the world"" instead is extremely enticing, and I feel I would in some sense be selling out if I took the job. I could also potentially kill myself by doing both at the same time (online master's).

If I wanted to do the master's or a PhD later (company will pay for some of it after a year of work), it would take 2 years and would not be at the same caliber of institution as my current one, due to my underwhelming 3.2 GPA. (I do have research experience, but it is not too focused). If I wanted to do the Master's, I can also convert this full-time offer to another summer internship and then start in 2020 with a salary bump as well - the company is not going anywhere. However, the Master's would run me about $40,000 in total for the year- about a $200,000 opportunity cost. Is this really worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry if this sounds condescending or hoity-toity to anyone. I am just as confused as you as to why somebody wants to pay me three times the median household income as soon as I can legally have a drink. I would really appreciate any help, especially from engineers/scientists who have gone through something similar. Thank you!

I am thinking something but, I can't organize them. Can you help me with this problem? I will be glad if you answer me with some ideas, photograph or videos.

In general, however, I find people want to get to the sex too quickly and spend less time developing the characters. 

I’ve got other ideas, too, and I’d love to hear some of yours.

If we hit it off, I’ve got a story I’ve written that I’d like to share. 

Anyway, here’s my dpp prompt that could serve as a basis for a story.
*****

I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa (but you can choose a different name, if you prefer). I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are.

Ideally this would go on for a bit. I like buildup.

Ideally I’d find a partner who wants to chat and role play beyond this scenario assuming there’s some chemistry.

Sometimes I have a lot of time, sometimes I can only write once a day. "

He always wanted me to help him out with his problems, but not the other way around. Funny how he said ""we're not in a relationship"" whenever I needed anything, but whenever he was in desperate need for a rock and support in his life, he always came running to me about how much he loves me, what a great girlfriend I am, introducing me to his loved ones, taking me out, doing all those loving acts and giving all those promises. We were only ""in a relationship"" whenever it was convenient for him. 

He was going to prison soon and had the audacity to ask me to write a character reference about how he helped me with my drug and alcohol addiction (I was never a drug addict btw I just dabbled here and there), but he never helped me with SHIT. When I was dealing with some domestic violence (family stuff, my schizophrenic brother beat me until my nose was all bloody and cops had to arrest him), and I was looking for another place, he never offered me a place to stay even though he was looking for roommates. Whenever he came back from his lawyer visits and courts, he kept texting me about how he needed a ride from the train station, and I ALWAYS left him hanging. I never gave him a ride. He didn't get it through his thick skull that I am NOT going to help him with his legal issues. He never helped me with mine so why should I with his?

I remember how he kept begging and begging for me to write his character reference, to say I was his alcoholic junkie girlfriend who he helped, and be there for him in the court room during his sentencing hearing. After months of not being there for me, he expected me to write a letter and tell the judge about what an amazing, helpful guy he is. HA! He even wanted me to send an email to my professor about how I'll be absent to class (I was taking an accelerated summer course at that time) so I can fly with him, and be there with him and his parents in the court room to speak up to the judge in person. He made all the promises that he always does, he said we'd explore that city, go to comedy shows, eat at new nice places there, and so on.  He kept begging me nonstop, then settled with ""okay, just write about how I helped you with your alcoholism."" HELPED ME? HE NEVER HELPED ME WITH SHIT. I BENT BACKWARDS FOR HIM AND HE NEVER APPRECIATED ANYTHING. ALL HE DID WAS TAKE TAKE TAKE AND NEVER GIVE, MESSAGE LADYBOYS FROM GRINDR BEHIND MY BACK, THEN TOOK **ME** TO GAY BARS AND PRIDE CELEBRATIONS AS A SLAP TO MY FACE. HOW MANY DICKS DID HE SUCK WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING? HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I HELPED HIM CLEAN HIS PLACE AFTER HE INVITED THOSE GAY MEN OR HIS FRIENDS OVER, AND I HAD NO IDEA. HE WAS BI AND ALSO MESSAGED GIRLS ON FACEBOOK, BUT HE'S UGLY AND FAT SO THEY REJECTED AND GHOSTED HIS UGLY FAT ASS. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS ENDEARING AT THE TIME BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE'S SUCH AN UGLY FAT REJECT WHO NO OTHER GIRL WILL WANT, I LIKE THAT BECAUSE WE COULD HAVE BEING A REJECT IN COMMON AND ALL. LITTLE DID I KNOW I WAS GOING TO BE TALKING TO SOME ASIAN MALE LADYBOY ABOUT HOW HE JUST FUCKED MY BOYFRIEND. AND THE MOST HILARIOUS THING IS HOW HE WAS BRAGGING TO THAT ASIAN LADYBOY ABOUT HOW HE WENT TO AN INTERVIEW FOR AN INTERNSHIP THAT * **I** * HOOKED HIM UP WITH (IT WAS INITIALLY OFFERED TO ME, BUT I ALREADY HAD ANOTHER JOB OFFER FOR THE SEMESTER SO I GAVE HIM HR'S INFORMATION AND THEN HE TALKED TO THEM, HE SAID I RECOMMENDED HIM AND THEY GAVE HIM AN INTERVIEW). I WAS SUCH A FOOL!!!!!!!!!!

So after all his begging and pleading, I told him to get the FUCK out of my house and to rot in prison. I TOLD HIM IN HIS FACE: ""WE'RE NOT IN RELATIONSHIP!"" :^) then later sent him texts of another guy I was talking to from online dating. HAHAHAHA! SOOOOOOO SATISFYING. LOVE IT! WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND MOTHERFUCKER!

But anyway, yeah. The next time I saw him, I drank his vodka behind his back, got drunk and burned myself with cigarettes while he watched. He tried to stop me, but couldn't. I banged my head against his door until I was bruised on my forehead the next day. In fact, that area is still slightly sensitive to this day because of how HARD I was banging. THANKS FOR THE HELP! Now he's in prison, alone, with no girlfriend to visit him, write him letters or put money on his books for commissary. Haha. "

Like everything from configurations to programms and apps to tools and accessories.

let me give an example: I have a surfac pro 3, typecover, backlit black danish layout, surface modern mouse, standard pen, and a nice folder organiser that I actually fit my tablet into.

I run win8.1 with some updates. One account, don't hide taskbar, use google chrome, and my home screen looks like this: [https://imgur.com/a/2iYIybr](https://imgur.com/a/2iYIybr)

I bought it because of math+chemistry-sketchings, and wrist pain. And I had used tablets before it was cool and practical. What is neat is, when I interned at an investment firm, I immediately looked like an employee because I, contrary to other interns, had the pc that everyone was required to use because of higher-ups.

9rylic,2,2018-10-27,I just need a win,oneyesterday,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9rylic/i_just_need_a_win/,"I’m having one of those days, where everything feels like it’s going the worst way imaginable, but this time I’m so concerned because I’m not certain that I’ll be able to pull myself up. 

I’ve been exhausted, physically and emotionally, over the last couple of months. I’ve been having an academically-intensive semester in my fourth year of a five-year law degree in India. On top of that, I just got back from four months in London as part of an exchange program - a personal high that I’m not sure I’ll ever reach again. 

I’ve been trying to do the best I can. I’ve been trying to give back to my college community. I’ve signed up (voluntarily) for a bunch of activities, both academic and otherwise, aimed at making campus a better space all around. I’m a member of the internship coordination committee, a bunch of academic groups working on policy recommendations, and most significantly, I’m the founder of a campus group advocating for women’s rights and campaigning against sexual harassment on our campus. I have also involuntarily become one of the ‘senior’ students who people come to for help, often without any gratitude, and I’ve spent a lot of time this semester pushing for the creation of a mental health support group (mostly, I’ll admit, for myself).

Over the last week in particular, our campus has been undergoing a strong version of the Me Too movement, coinciding with Kavanaugh as well as a bunch of female Bollywood actors coming out in public. We’ve seen sexual harassers on campus being named and shamed in public, and are finally seeing open conversations about assault and due process. As someone who’s put myself ‘out there’ because of my very public stance on certain issues, I’ve spent the last week with a bunch of sleepless nights listening to and talking to people. 

I have exams going on at the moment, but all my time is being taken up by other people and I don’t want to say it’s anyone’s fault but I’m just so tired of not being able to focus on myself. On top of this, a couple of my academic commitments fell through because my moot team bailed on me at the last minute, and I’m increasingly being worried about my own future and career because of the lack of actual things that I have done to advance my chances - done for myself - in the last three years, because of teams falling through and other people saying they have to put their own needs first. 

My sleep schedule has been irrevocably fucked up, and I’m now sick. I just got my period and I have terrible terrible cramps, I’m curled over in bed but I have to get up and go out of my room again soon. A couple of hours ago I cut my finger on a metal nail on the side of someone else’s room. It feels like nothing - my career plans, my health, my crush, my life - is going anywhere. It feels like I’m stuck and nothing I do is going to change that. It feels like I keep putting effort into things, only to lose over and over again. 

I just need one small thing to go right. I just need one thing that can make me believe in all of this again. I’m sorry, I don’t know if this is the right sub but I just needed to rant.

9rz3ic,3,2018-10-27,The Afterlife Can Be an Unusual Place,Chris183539,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/9rz3ic/the_afterlife_can_be_an_unusual_place/,"Hello there dearest reader. Before we get started, allow me to introduce myself. My earthly name was Marcus Wade. I’m not entirely sure what the purpose of sharing my personal accounts with you is, but maybe I do it just because I can.  You can make your own assumptions as you go, but I’d rather not go on a tangent for too long before the story. So, allow me to tell you about my experiences in the afterlife. I think they may interest you. Maybe things will change in the future, and if they do, I will continue to describe such experiences to you. For now, I present you with what I know and have seen as of now. Events which shaped my life after death and continue to do so.

I awoke, yet I did not remember falling asleep. Perhaps that is death, if you can even call the process in which I experienced death.  Can something which never was truly alive be deceased? I ask that as a man without a family or a legacy to call my own. All I saw around me was nothingness. I say nothingness because there exists no language within the mortal world to describe where I found myself, and that was when I realized my worth.

I learned that I only ever amounted to all of which those who lived and died before me discovered, and my progression of thought and discovery would come to a halt once I discovered true omniscience. Yet, true omniscience was a fallacy. A myth created so the foolish people such as I would find themselves on a wild goose chase to self-proclaimed superiority rather than become progressive members of society. Sound pretentious? That’s because that was who I was as a man. So there I sat, unmissed by anyone, and totally unfazed by the fact that I was in the afterlife.

A state of clarity had washed over me once I found myself in this strange place. It was as if all my foolish were exposed and I was enlightened to the truth and the difference between right and wrong. Throughout my life, I was completely obsessed with learning as much as I could, so I could prove to those who doubted me I was better than they had assumed I was.

Now that I was dead, I could only be surrounded by thoughts and memories as my mind expanded further and I came to understand what I hadn't before. Fitting wasn’t it? As a man whose sole purpose was discovery and intelligence, this newfound knowledge could only be described as a euphoric feeling to me. Heavenly, if you will. Yes, this was Heaven. It had to be, for what else could possibly be concluded based on the information at hand?

I found myself uncomfortable at first. The sensation of being a sentient, yet disembodied was strange due to the amount of time I had previously spent as a living, breathing person, but I soon got used to my circumstances. I had all the time in the world to think, and so that is exactly what I did. I sat there for as long as I can remember, pondering over past events and actions. Some of them I took great pride in, whilst I kicked myself over my own stupidity when recalling others.

It felt like an eternity before I saw it. Some sort of bright light penetrated my vision, and I was finally able to see the world around me. A perfectly rectangular room, devoid of any furniture, was what I saw. I looked down and saw a hand. It was my own... I had seemingly regained my mortal body once more. The walls and floor of the room were in pristine condition, and everything appeared in a white coating of paint. In the center of the room sat a single white desk, where a large desktop computer sat mounted on top of it.

I slowly made my way over to the old-fashioned equipment and sat in the chair, pushing the power button to the computer. I heard the soft humming of the machinery as the screen faintly lit up, revealing a blue background screen and a single application in the center. I moved the mouse until the pointer hovered over the app, my curiosity at its peak. Then, I clicked twice and watched as a brand new page popped up in front of me, filling the screen entirely.

I watched as a plethora of dates and times appeared before my eyes, each accompanied by a video file. Unsure of what any of this meant, I clicked on the very first link. Upon doing so, a downloadable file appeared, which I opened. Much to my surprise, the download automatically started playing the video within it. I saw a woman in a hospital bed. The expression on her face was that of pain, and I heard her crying in agony as various doctors and nurses did their best to comfort her.

The woman was someone who I had recognized. She was... she was my own mother. After several minutes of her exasperated wailing, one of the doctors lifted up a small child, showing my mother as pride and joy filled her eyes. As soon as the video ended, the download file closed out and I was returned back to the original web page. For a minute, I was left speechless. Upon looking at the file more closely, I recognized the date on it as my birthday. Before me was every single important event in my life.

I took the time to watch a few of these videos, of course. Several birthdays of mine, my first girlfriend, my first few cars and homes. There were hundreds, if not thousands of videos detailing some of the best times of my life. I sat in awe as I watched the early days of my childhood replaying right in front of me. It was truly one of the most fascinating moments I had ever experienced. This fascination, however, was short-lived. Soon, I felt a new, much less pleasant feeling. One of disappointment and regret. I am referring to the events which took place in my life after my childhood.

Now, I had been aware of the poor decisions I had made in life before I found the mysterious computer room. In fact, it was some of those very memories in which I had pondered in my previous state. However, there is a large difference between recalling something and actually witnessing it again with your own eyes. For instance, when I had remembered my various arguments with my parents, the kids and teachers at school mocking me for my low intelligence and work ethic, the feelings associated with such events didn't shake me up as much as viewing my bullies and relatives berate me with insults, believing I would end up as a nobody or some hooligan on the streets.

Even more disheartening was that there were more download links involving the negative aspects of my life than there were positive ones. It is a sad fact of life that adulthood lasts far longer than childhood, and my adult years grew even more depressing as the slow, definite march of time continued. Still, there was nothing I could do within my afterlife except watch as my pathetic life devolved from the innocence of a child to the contempt of a grumpy man, so I continued.

When those closest to me had doubted my ability to progress at the rate of the other children, I personally took it upon myself to prove them wrong. As a young boy with very few friends or hobbies, such a task became my passion, and I spent nearly all my time with my nose stuck in any book I could get my hands on.

I completely ignored any other entertaining activity a boy my age would gladly partake in, even opting to study on my birthday and other fun events in my life. Thus, as my high school years started, I isolated myself from all distractions in order to prove myself capable of outsmarting anyone who dared doubt me. As you can imagine from someone like me, I considered people distractions as well, causing many relationships with the few friends and family I had to shatter completely. These were the years that marked the beginning of my downfall.

After reviewing my teenage years, I decided to move on. I clicked on the scrollbar and dragged it downwards, waiting a bit before stopping once more and selecting a new date. I was an adult at that point in time, and my studying and hard work had paid off. Well, paid off as far as financial security was involved. Despite being socially inept and losing most of those I cared for, I carried on with my anti-social tendencies until I found myself in a good college and got into a well-paying job. I had moved up the ranks rather quickly in the workplace, soon becoming a top-ranking supervisor who enjoyed commanding my orderlies around like they were dogs.

I sat in my chair in disbelief as I watched the smug grin on my face while I barked out instructions to colleagues and interns alike. The nerve I had to treat others such a way. Perhaps it was the afterlife and the newfound clarity and sensibility I discovered upon entering it that allowed me to see clearly the problems with my behavior. It also allowed me to see the scowls and rude remarks muttered under the breath of various employees who looked upon me in disgust. I had been blind to such things in my human state, but apparently, I wasn't anymore.

This behavior wasn't just common in the workplace, but outside of it as well. It wasn't long before the neighborhood came to realize my rather distasteful tendencies and steered clear of me altogether, to which I paid them no mind. It was my choice and mine alone to live a life of solitude, and for the longest time, I was known as the mean old man who lived at the end of the block.

I never smiled, nor did I ever laugh. The very few people who saw me outside of my house or outside of work only ever saw me with a scowl permanently sewn to my face. I didn't decorate for Christmas or Halloween. I didn't send or receive gifts or partake in the many activities within the community. If there was precious work to be done or information to be learned, I focused all of my attention on it.

Speaking of Halloween, I found a few video files around that holiday. I decided to watch some of them and found that even though I never had a single frightening prop out on my porch or yard, not one kid within the area would come near my residence. I actually found myself chucking at this fact, figuring their parents must have warned them about the scary old fart who would surely throw a fit should he be disturbed, regardless of the circumstances. My curiosity started withering away as I clicked on the scroll bar and continued downwards. It was at that moment that I realized I had almost reached the bottom of the page, and only a few downloads remained.

They were nothing special really. Just a few videos of me lashing out at some more people who dared commit the heinous crime of trying to socially interact with me. Yeah, I'm surprised I made it into heaven again in this first place. Then again, it was never made apparent where I was. As far as I knew it wasn't heaven, but just some random phase of the afterlife I found myself in. Regardless, I don't make the rules, nor will I attempt to understand them in a vain attempt to know everything. After all, why make the same mistakes in the afterlife as I did in the mortal world.

Now, the reason why my palms became sweaty upon nearing the end of the timeline is that, as you may have guessed, the final date was the date of my death. You also may have wondered why a spirit is choosing to spend time typing his recounting of life and death online, and the answer to that question is simple. I didn't have a normal life, nor did I have a normal death.  I have to share what happened to me with you all simply because I feel obligated to do so. Maybe it can serve as a warning, or perhaps I feel the need to share because some things are simply too insane not to spread. Regardless, I'm already this far, so I might as well continue.

It took me quite some time to muster up the courage to download the final video. Despite mentally preparing myself for what was to come numerous times, I was still hesitant. I found myself out of the chair and pacing the room at one point, taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm myself down. It seemed like hours before I was ready to witness the most important, and most upsetting, day of my life. The day which transferred me from the land of the living to that of the dead.

Summoning each ounce of bravery within me, I clicked the link and watched as the download opened and the video automatically played. I frantically chewed at my fingernails as I watched myself in my living room, sitting comfortably in my recliner chair. I saw the coffee mug in one hand and newspaper in the other as I did what I had always done best, absorbing all the information I could. The night was black as tar and the wind sung its soft tune. I could notice all these details and more as my eyes closely watched.

It felt as if I were experiencing the event in real time, except this time, unlike my human counterpart, I knew what the outcome would be. I knew that that living, breathing person who had been me would live their last day. A life would abruptly end and I would bear witness to my own demise, and it caused my skin to crawl, my entire body trembling. It was an eerie feeling indeed.

This video was longer than the previous ones. While the others had been just thirty seconds to a minute or two at most, this one was several minutes longer in comparison. I watched myself take a quick swig of my coffee and stand up, making my way to the kitchen. This version of me... a person who I had trouble conceiving was the exact person I am.

I.. I knew the noise was coming but I didn't realize it would come so soon in the video. The sound of glass shattering filled the house as the ""alive version of me"" turned quickly and grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter, slowly making his way back into the living room. I practically screamed at the monitor in front of me, begging myself not to do what I was about to. These efforts were fruitless, of course. If I could change the past I wouldn't be in my current predicament, now would I?

I saw myself flick on the light and stare at the broken glass window in confusion. There was nobody in sight, and I had relaxed my body due to a false sense of security. It was foolish, and although my relaxation was just for a split second, it was enough. A large man in a mask pounced from behind the wall, tackling me to the floor.

I covered my eyes, not wanting to see the massacre that was destined to unfold, but morbid curiosity forced tiny creases in between my fingers to allow peepholes. I had to see... I had to see. This computer allowed me a new perspective on what had happened in my life, and I just couldn't help but watch as the man wrapped his arms around my throat, seemingly unbothered by my futile attempts to defend myself.

I leaned back in my chair and felt my body tense up as the man forced his knee into my ribs trying to cease my efforts at escaping, his grip around my throat tight as ever. Finally, after an uncomfortable amount of silence, the man released his hold on me and got up, watching over my limp body. My face was pale and my eyes were bloodshot, an expression of surprise on my face. It was the first time I had seen any emotion besides contempt within me.

I let out a long sigh of relief as the video finally came to an end and the download closed out. I placed my hand on my throat and rubbed gently. It was almost as if I felt choked just by reliving my final moments on Earth. I got up once more, pacing the perimeter of the white room. I felt sick to my stomach at the prospect of the computer. I had access to any moment in my life at the click of a button, including my own murder. I took a seat in criss-cross position at one of the four corners of the room.

It could have been anyone who killed me in all honesty. I had lots of enemies. People who I showed disdain for returned such feelings. People in the workplace, people in the neighborhood. Hell, even what was left of my family at the time had felt deep resentment towards me. Funny enough, despite the heavy torment I faced at their hands in childhood, even when I solved their issues with me of being a stupid kid they didn't seem satisfied. In truth, I don't really regret cutting them off from my life. Sure, I regret leaving some of them. Quite a few of my cousins had always treated me with respect and dignity, however, I feel no pity towards any of the others.

When I went back to the computer and turned the monitor back on, I was immediately met by something curious. There, right next to the first app, stood another. It was a notepad with a title named after me. I looked all around me, looking for any other entities within the room. There was nothing. Not only that, but there were no entry points in the room either. No doors, no windows, and upon further inspection I found no sign of hidden hatches either. There was absolutely no way another person could have gotten in, leading me to believe that the app had appeared all by itself.

Realizing once more that I truly had nothing better to do, I clicked on the notepad and watched as the document opened. Several paragraphs of text sat before me. After reading the document, I realized that unlike the video files, it didn't detail the events which took place while I was alive. Rather, it was an article describing what happened after I died. I felt my eyebrows rise while my eyes scanned the screen, taking in the information presented to me. While I can't remember the exact words I read, I can paraphrase what they said.

In summary, after I died there were several suspects the police rounded up and interrogated. I recognized each of the names listed by the article as people I had come into contact with in life. My experiences with all of them were, needless to say, negative. In all fairness, there were plenty of people who would have the motive to murder me, but not a single one was found guilty. According to the article, all who were questioned were eventually released due to ""insufficient evidence"", although I found that rather hard to believe. Despite not wanting to believe it, a part of me felt as if the case wasn't taken as seriously due to my reputation around the community. Still, none of it mattered now. Not anymore.

When I moved past that part of the article, I found that the topic had shifted from the strange circumstances surrounding my death to the impact on my community. My house had been put on the market, but nobody would buy it. Apparently, nobody would buy a house where someone had been murdered. What had once been a dead zone during the holidays became a neighborhood attraction for some of the younger kids, especially during Halloween. It was at that moment during the reading that I froze, my face completely blank. It had been... years since I died. I placed my head in my hands and took several deep breaths, which did almost nothing to calm my nerves.

Then I continued reading the article, my breathe exasperated, I saw it expanding upon the previous point in the writing. Many teenagers would dare each other on the scariest day of the year, October 31st, to spend the night near my house or, in some cases, sneak in. Apparently, tales of my mean attitude and murder spread like wildfire upon my death, causing tons of ghost stories and rumors to be told around the campfire.

I found several more video files within the notepad, which I didn't even realize could be stored there, but then again, I had learned that I couldn't expect anything ordinary now. I downloaded the links and watched several videos of teens sneaking in and out of the house at Halloween. Some spent the night, while others got too scared to stay and ran home crying. I must admit, the house did look pretty creepy. It was unkempt and probably unsafe to stay in, with cobwebs covering the porch and the paint on the outside peeled and chipped.

The inside of the house, from what I could tell, wasn't in much better condition. It was completely barren of furniture and the floor was coated in a thin layer of dust. There were very few places in the home where light could be found, mostly due to the windows being boarded up. I watched a video of a rather timid-looking kid make his way up the steps to the second story, the stairs creaking every couple of seconds.

He looked all around, taking in his surroundings. He allowed the flashlight in his right hand to illuminate the room. With that, he layed out a sleeping bag on the cold hard floor. There were dozens of kids who had done the same. Eventually, the local authorities took notice and would often have a patrol car near my house during Halloween in order to make sure no kids were trespassing. Once again I was taken back by the amount of time that had passed since my death. Perhaps it had been longer than I thought.

Finally, the kids stopped showing up, and so did the police. I could feel my heart sink a little at that. Something about the fun the kids had, while juvenile, reminded me of the some of the fun I missed out on as a boy, and the fact that their fun was ending somewhat saddened me. I looked at the article and saw it come to an abrupt end, to which I closed the notepad and returned my gaze to the monitor home screen.  Rubbing my eyes in fatigue, I felt the incoming sensation of sleep.  I found it odd how I could feel sleepy in the afterlife, but I suppose it's pretty tiring to see what I had. I felt myself drifting off, and without much thought, I allowed sleep to embrace me.

I woke up the day after, or at least I think it was the day after. I had no concept of time within that white room, and I was disappointed upon waking up to find that nothing had changed. I was afraid that all the afterlife would provide me was contemplation in the form of this computer in front of me. Stretching my hand forward and gripping the mouse, I shook it a little to wake the monitor up. The background had changed from a purely blue screen to a black and white checkerboard style image.

Once again I looked around the room for any place someone could enter and alter the computer, only to find nothing again. Shifting my attention back to the screen, I noticed one more item that hadn't been there the previous day. It was a folder, and upon opening it I found a page titled ""Instructions"". It was in an application which I was unfamiliar with, but I proceeded in opening it anyways.

Inside was a single link. Figuring there was no harm in clicking one more, I hovered my mouse above it. However, I hesitated. Something about this link seemed odd to me. This wasn't like the others and I knew it, but I had no idea how. Still... there was only one way to find out where it lead. Sighing, I tapped the mouse and opened the link. And once I did so, my vision went black.

For a single moment in time, I thought I had gone blind, and it terrified me. The white room surrounding me was gone and replaced with darkness, and for that split second I wanted to scream, but couldn't. I couldn't do anything really, and it was awful. I would say my heart was pounding against my chest but I couldn't feel my heartbeat, nor was I sure if I had a chest or body at all for that matter.

I couldn't feel my own existence. It was like for a moment I stopped existing within reality, becoming an abstract being. I didn't exist, yet I did. That's as best as I could describe that odd, terrifying sensation. As soon as it started it stopped, and I was snapped back into reality. I stumbled a bit and fell to my knees, gasping for air as I felt beads of sweat running down my face. It was amazing how alive and human I felt even as a spirit. My blurred vision finally came into focus and fixated on the floor beneath me.

The first thing that I noticed was that the floor wasn't white, meaning I wasn't inside the room I had become so familiar with. Instead, the floor was wooden and cold, coated in a thin layer of dust. I stood to my knees and looked around, taking in various features around me. Recognizable features which allowed me to easily identify the place I was in. It was my own house.

It looked the same as it had through the videos I saw while kids searched through it. I saw the same boarded windows, heard the same creaking floorboards... yes, it was mine alright. I was confused as to why I was there, and I felt my heart speed up as I noticed where I was standing. It was the exact same spot as where my murder had taken place.

Feeling uncomfortable with where I was, I moved to the front door and placed my hand on the cold doorknob. I tried turning it but to no avail. The door wouldn't open. I looked down at the lock, only to see that it wasn't turned. I grasped the doorknob and frantically began turning, unable to exit the house. I rushed to the back door and found that the same thing happened.

I pushed up on the windows not boarded and found that no matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't budge. I was trapped inside my own house, with no way to escape. I pounded my fists on the door and screamed at the top of my lungs despite knowing damn well that not a soul in the world could hear me.

My body found itself slumped over in front of the back door, twiddling my thumbs and tapping my foot lightly. I took several deep breaths in an attempt to distract myself from my situation and tried thinking of some sort of solution. Why had what happened, happened? Why view my entire life in rewind and study my legacy after death just to be trapped in the very house I was killed in? It was madness.

I slammed my fist against the floor in a fit of rage and got up once more, clutching my head and violently pulling at strands of my hair. After several minutes spent in frustration, I allowed myself to settle down and explore my now abandoned home. I figured that there was no point in getting too worked up over it anyway.

I made my way up the stairs and down the hallway. Despite the second story being completely enveloped in darkness, I found it quite easy to see and navigate, as if I had my own set of built-in night vision. At the end of the corridor was a door to my room. There was something odd about it, and it wasn't a subtle type of odd either. A fluorescent glow emitted from within the room, shining brightly through the cracks. I made my way towards this glow and, much to my approval, I found I was able to open the door.

Upon entering I realized that glow coming from a computer screen within the room. It was my computer, inexplicably clean and in the same spot it had always been despite the rest of the house being bare. I lifted the computer and realized that a fine layer of dust say underneath where the computer was, which should have been impossible had a solid object truly been on top of it. I had realized that this wasn't my computer, but something provided to me as a tool. It was my very own resource and I found that it came equipped with apps and an internet connection.

I couldn't explain this at all... but something was allowing me to communicate to the outside world. What seemed like a blessing in disguise, however, would turn out to be my only way to share to you this story and what follows. It wouldn't turn out to be a convenient device as a gift, but a way to retell the painful experience that is to follow,

The other thing I noticed about the computer was the date and time. Wondering what time and day it was, I looked, only for my eyes to widen. The date was October 31st.

It was the morning of Halloween, and it was then that I realized my presence within my house was no coincidence. I was meant to be here, on this very night. I remembered my thoughts in the past. If you recall, the kids within the neighborhood would gather around my house at Halloween, each daring each other to enter the old abandoned house where a murder took place years ago. I wondered, however, about the police, until I then recalled their absence recently as the teenagers died down. I then realized that because of the lack of law enforcement specifically in front of my house, there was a possibility that they would be back and enter once more.

A smile grew onto my face as I realized that my dismay upon hearing these kids and their mischievous fun would come to an end would now be invalidated. My smile only grew wider at the prospect that perhaps I would be able to help these kids have fun and do their fair share of devious acts, seeing as how I was too foolish and full of myself as a young lad to do so myself, thus losing part of my very childhood. Yes, I understood my purpose. I was to haunt the very house I was killed in. While that idea might have sounded very unsettling to the average man, I was excited to relive a part of my life I missed out on.

I peered out into the brightly lit road and observed the houses in the distance. Many cheap Halloween decorations adorned the neighborhood, and I saw a few young kids board a bright yellow school bus. I had the whole day to prepare for the night to come. I chuckled to myself. They had no idea what they were in for.

As the sun withdrew from the sky and fell below the horizon, I saw dozens of kids running out of their homes, candy bags gripped tightly within their hands. They skipped and galloped down the road with plastic masks portraying witches and ghouls and all sorts of creatures of darkness. To each house in view, they approached with glee and knocked upon the doors. They laughed joyously as candy was emptied into their bags and moved onto the next houses. None of them stopped at mine though.

The evening progressed, and the night grew darker. The moon stood high in the night sky and provided a comforting light in every direction. Many of the younger kids had gone home by that point, and only a few teenagers remained. My heart fell as a thought formed in the back of my mind. What if nobody tried staying the night? What if they were too afraid of police confrontation to take the risk?

I didn't want to believe it. This was my chance to make up for my failure in life and help those currently living. Yet, I wouldn't get that chance, would I? Figuring the night was a failure, I laid down on the floor and placed my arms under my head, resting my eyes. I allowed my body to relax and breathed out deeply . Did you know spirits can dream? I didn't, but I know now. I found myself lucidly dreaming that night, sitting within my old recliner chair. Well, it wasn't me who was sitting. I couldn't quite see who the person was because their face was hidden behind the newspaper they held. I approached them slowly, clearing my throat and tightening my fist. I placed my hand on the top of the paper and pulled it down, attempting to find out who the man was. Then, I jumped back, startled and afraid.

There, sitting in the recliner chair, sat a large man in a mask. He threw down the paper and leaped to his feet, approaching me with surprising speed. I fell backward and hit my head on the wall, and I watched in terror as his hand opened and wrapped around my throat, choking me.

I struggled for air as my face turned blue. My lungs felt as if they were on fire, and I scraped and clawed at the man's arms and face, attempting to sink my nails into his skin and draw bled. Trying to do anything I could to free myself of his grip.

I couldn't. I was too weak to stop my assailant, and I felt myself slipping. I felt the veins bulging from underneath my skin as my eyes became bloodshot. It felt as if they would pop out from the sockets. It felt so real... as if I would die once more. I was reliving my worst moment. Every second of it, I felt. It was all so familiar to me. The furniture around the room within my dream had been knocked over in the struggle, and here I was, death slowly approaching me.

Of that entire ordeal, the most horrifying moment to me was when my entire body went limp, yet I could still see. I could still see, breathe, and feel. I was conscious and aware, trapped inside of a dead body. I was completely and utterly out of control, like a session of sleep paralysis. I watched as the man released me from his grip and stood over me, admiring his work. I witnessed him slip his fingers underneath his mask, pulling upwards. What I saw underneath that black, foreboding mask will forever be ingrained into my mind for eternity.

It was me... it was my face. I saw it clear as day. My skin was pale and slightly blue. The eyes were bloodshot as they had been upon my death, and worms wriggled around through open holes and wounds caused by the process of decay. A mixture of mud and grass filled the thing's mouth, leaving little to no room for the being to speak. I struggled to comprehend what was happening as the figure grabbed a black shovel seemingly out of nowhere.

The monstrosity moved out of sight and I heard the sounds of wooden floorboards being removed. As soon as the thing was done with that task, I heard the sound of dirt being removed from the ground. Within minutes the creature was done with its job and lifted me with superhuman strength, tossing me into the hole it had just made.

My screams were muffled by my inability to open my mouth as the thing shoveled the dirt on top of me. As the earth filled my makeshift tomb, my sight was lost. The last thing I heard was the faint laughter coming from the creature that had reenacted my murder. A creature that appeared to be me, but wasn't...It was jeering me.

I sat up abruptly, drenched in my own sweat and tears. I shifted into a fetal position, rocking back and forth while a million thoughts rushed through my mind. What the hell just happened? Did I really see what I thought I had? There was no way in hell it was real... any of it! I shivered and shook and I just couldn't sit still and nothing made sense. That nightmare had shaken me to my core and I wiped my forehead. I hadn't felt that type of fear since the date of my death. I thought there would be nothing to fear after death, but I was wrong. Maybe nothing can hurt or kill me anymore, but the memories and nightmares which plague me will remain forever.

Not only would my murder dominate my dreams completely, but I wondered, and feared, whether my regrets in life would as well. I wondered if the loneliness I experienced at my own hand would eventually get to me. I felt tears well up within my eyes as I struggled to find a reason behind any of this. I hadn't a clue why and I may never have a clue. The afterlife is supposed to be eternal bliss. The sweet release of death was supposed to help liberate us from the problems of life but they seem to follow us into death.

Perhaps it is a blessing, or perhaps it is a curse. Would I be able to feel happy if such feelings and issues didn't follow us? This truth will forever elude me most likely, but it is something I feel the need to ponder. Yes, it is quite ironic that I do perhaps even more thinking here than I do in life. However, over time I have come to believe that our motivations and intentions behind our actions determine their effect and morality. I myself am a good example of this.

The computer provided to me allowed me to write down notes such as these for further contemplation in the future, as well as reflect on ideas in the past. The Halloween night I described earlier happened about two years ago. After that night, I found myself trapped within my own house until the following Halloween. Luckily enough for me, time seemed to progress faster than it normally would until that day. The house seemed to be pretty devoid of activity until that Halloween though, so I myself had to find entertainment in other activities such as, well, writing.

I wrote about my experiences within the computer, this being one such story, and it keeps me sane. I suppose that's another reason why I was presented this hunk of junk replica of my past life laptop. It's a good way to be active and kept up to date while in the very confined world I live in.

The nightmares I had kept on coming. I'd say they occurred about once every week or two. Some of them were harsh, such as the one where I had to live through my murder again. Others weren't nearly as bad but still caused me to feel sick to my stomach, such as witnessing several life-changing moments in which I pushed family away. Such dreams confirmed my theory about certain moments in my life full with negative connotations coming back to haunt me.

I was convinced for some time that the nightmares I had were, in part, punishment for my actions in life as a cruel and negligent man. However, nothing else in the afterworld really seemed to back up this idea, so it is just another theory of mine for now. There are still many questions I have that I am unsure how to answer, so I may seem uncertain a lot of times. In truth, life after death doesn't truly answer our questions about the universe. I've no clue if this experience happening to me is similar to other spirits. Thus, with no comparison to offer, I cannot offer with certainty that events such as this will be similar to others.

When last year's Halloween arrived, I was filled with hope once more. It was a promising day, and I would pray that someone would dare enter my home.  Again I saw the kids in their plastic masks and neat costumes skip down the road for a night of trick-or-treating. Just like every year before, they would go up to a neighborhood house, knock on the door, and joyfully accept their delicious treats. The night went on, the kids got their candy, and they all avoided my house once again.

A frown formed on my face as I lost hope, realizing that it would be another boring Halloween for me. I hung my head low and made my way over to my spot on the floor, lazily sitting with my legs spread out haphazardly. I leaned my head against the wall and listened to the sounds of the children's fun dissipate. The moon had risen once more, and the children made their way back to their homes.

Breathing out slowly, I prepared to fall asleep once more. Well, until I heard a strange noise outside the house. I opened my eyes and shifted my head toward the back door where the sound originated. I saw several shadows moving around outside the window, soft murmurs accompanying the motion.

I sat up, my interest peaked. Could it be what I thought it was? Could it be what I had been hoping for all those years? I got my answer in the form of the window near the back door sliding open and a small boy stealthily making his way into the house. He couldn't have been more than 15 years old.

9rz614,2,2018-10-27,The Afterlife Can Be an Unusual Place,Chris183539,clancypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/clancypasta/comments/9rz614/the_afterlife_can_be_an_unusual_place/,"Hello there dearest reader. Before we get started, allow me to introduce myself. My earthly name was Marcus Wade. I’m not entirely sure what the purpose of sharing my personal accounts with you is, but maybe I do it just because I can. You can make your own assumptions as you go, but I’d rather not go on a tangent for too long before the story. So, allow me to tell you about my experiences in the afterlife. I think they may interest you. Maybe things will change in the future, and if they do, I will continue to describe such experiences to you. For now, I present you with what I know and have seen as of now. Events which shaped my life after death and continue to do so.

I awoke, yet I did not remember falling asleep. Perhaps that is death, if you can even call the process in which I experienced death. Can something which never was truly alive be deceased? I ask that as a man without a family or a legacy to call my own. All I saw around me was nothingness. I say nothingness because there exists no language within the mortal world to describe where I found myself, and that was when I realized my worth.

I learned that I only ever amounted to all of which those who lived and died before me discovered, and my progression of thought and discovery would come to a halt once I discovered true omniscience. Yet, true omniscience was a fallacy. A myth created so the foolish people such as I would find themselves on a wild goose chase to self-proclaimed superiority rather than become progressive members of society. Sound pretentious? That’s because that was who I was as a man. So there I sat, unmissed by anyone, and totally unfazed by the fact that I was in the afterlife.

A state of clarity had washed over me once I found myself in this strange place. It was as if all my foolish were exposed and I was enlightened to the truth and the difference between right and wrong. Throughout my life, I was completely obsessed with learning as much as I could, so I could prove to those who doubted me I was better than they had assumed I was.

Now that I was dead, I could only be surrounded by thoughts and memories as my mind expanded further and I came to understand what I hadn't before. Fitting wasn’t it? As a man whose sole purpose was discovery and intelligence, this newfound knowledge could only be described as a euphoric feeling to me. Heavenly, if you will. Yes, this was Heaven. It had to be, for what else could possibly be concluded based on the information at hand?

I found myself uncomfortable at first. The sensation of being a sentient, yet disembodied was strange due to the amount of time I had previously spent as a living, breathing person, but I soon got used to my circumstances. I had all the time in the world to think, and so that is exactly what I did. I sat there for as long as I can remember, pondering over past events and actions. Some of them I took great pride in, whilst I kicked myself over my own stupidity when recalling others.

It felt like an eternity before I saw it. Some sort of bright light penetrated my vision, and I was finally able to see the world around me. A perfectly rectangular room, devoid of any furniture, was what I saw. I looked down and saw a hand. It was my own... I had seemingly regained my mortal body once more. The walls and floor of the room were in pristine condition, and everything appeared in a white coating of paint. In the center of the room sat a single white desk, where a large desktop computer sat mounted on top of it.

I slowly made my way over to the old-fashioned equipment and sat in the chair, pushing the power button to the computer. I heard the soft humming of the machinery as the screen faintly lit up, revealing a blue background screen and a single application in the center. I moved the mouse until the pointer hovered over the app, my curiosity at its peak. Then, I clicked twice and watched as a brand new page popped up in front of me, filling the screen entirely.

I watched as a plethora of dates and times appeared before my eyes, each accompanied by a video file. Unsure of what any of this meant, I clicked on the very first link. Upon doing so, a downloadable file appeared, which I opened. Much to my surprise, the download automatically started playing the video within it. I saw a woman in a hospital bed. The expression on her face was that of pain, and I heard her crying in agony as various doctors and nurses did their best to comfort her.

The woman was someone who I had recognized. She was... she was my own mother. After several minutes of her exasperated wailing, one of the doctors lifted up a small child, showing my mother as pride and joy filled her eyes. As soon as the video ended, the download file closed out and I was returned back to the original web page. For a minute, I was left speechless. Upon looking at the file more closely, I recognized the date on it as my birthday. Before me was every single important event in my life.

I took the time to watch a few of these videos, of course. Several birthdays of mine, my first girlfriend, my first few cars and homes. There were hundreds, if not thousands of videos detailing some of the best times of my life. I sat in awe as I watched the early days of my childhood replaying right in front of me. It was truly one of the most fascinating moments I had ever experienced. This fascination, however, was short-lived. Soon, I felt a new, much less pleasant feeling. One of disappointment and regret. I am referring to the events which took place in my life after my childhood.

Now, I had been aware of the poor decisions I had made in life before I found the mysterious computer room. In fact, it was some of those very memories in which I had pondered in my previous state. However, there is a large difference between recalling something and actually witnessing it again with your own eyes. For instance, when I had remembered my various arguments with my parents, the kids and teachers at school mocking me for my low intelligence and work ethic, the feelings associated with such events didn't shake me up as much as viewing my bullies and relatives berate me with insults, believing I would end up as a nobody or some hooligan on the streets.

Even more disheartening was that there were more download links involving the negative aspects of my life than there were positive ones. It is a sad fact of life that adulthood lasts far longer than childhood, and my adult years grew even more depressing as the slow, definite march of time continued. Still, there was nothing I could do within my afterlife except watch as my pathetic life devolved from the innocence of a child to the contempt of a grumpy man, so I continued.

When those closest to me had doubted my ability to progress at the rate of the other children, I personally took it upon myself to prove them wrong. As a young boy with very few friends or hobbies, such a task became my passion, and I spent nearly all my time with my nose stuck in any book I could get my hands on.

I completely ignored any other entertaining activity a boy my age would gladly partake in, even opting to study on my birthday and other fun events in my life. Thus, as my high school years started, I isolated myself from all distractions in order to prove myself capable of outsmarting anyone who dared doubt me. As you can imagine from someone like me, I considered people distractions as well, causing many relationships with the few friends and family I had to shatter completely. These were the years that marked the beginning of my downfall.

After reviewing my teenage years, I decided to move on. I clicked on the scrollbar and dragged it downwards, waiting a bit before stopping once more and selecting a new date. I was an adult at that point in time, and my studying and hard work had paid off. Well, paid off as far as financial security was involved. Despite being socially inept and losing most of those I cared for, I carried on with my anti-social tendencies until I found myself in a good college and got into a well-paying job. I had moved up the ranks rather quickly in the workplace, soon becoming a top-ranking supervisor who enjoyed commanding my orderlies around like they were dogs.

I sat in my chair in disbelief as I watched the smug grin on my face while I barked out instructions to colleagues and interns alike. The nerve I had to treat others such a way. Perhaps it was the afterlife and the newfound clarity and sensibility I discovered upon entering it that allowed me to see clearly the problems with my behavior. It also allowed me to see the scowls and rude remarks muttered under the breath of various employees who looked upon me in disgust. I had been blind to such things in my human state, but apparently, I wasn't anymore.

This behavior wasn't just common in the workplace, but outside of it as well. It wasn't long before the neighborhood came to realize my rather distasteful tendencies and steered clear of me altogether, to which I paid them no mind. It was my choice and mine alone to live a life of solitude, and for the longest time, I was known as the mean old man who lived at the end of the block.

I never smiled, nor did I ever laugh. The very few people who saw me outside of my house or outside of work only ever saw me with a scowl permanently sewn to my face. I didn't decorate for Christmas or Halloween. I didn't send or receive gifts or partake in the many activities within the community. If there was precious work to be done or information to be learned, I focused all of my attention on it.

Speaking of Halloween, I found a few video files around that holiday. I decided to watch some of them and found that even though I never had a single frightening prop out on my porch or yard, not one kid within the area would come near my residence. I actually found myself chucking at this fact, figuring their parents must have warned them about the scary old fart who would surely throw a fit should he be disturbed, regardless of the circumstances. My curiosity started withering away as I clicked on the scroll bar and continued downwards. It was at that moment that I realized I had almost reached the bottom of the page, and only a few downloads remained.

They were nothing special really. Just a few videos of me lashing out at some more people who dared commit the heinous crime of trying to socially interact with me. Yeah, I'm surprised I made it into heaven again in this first place. Then again, it was never made apparent where I was. As far as I knew it wasn't heaven, but just some random phase of the afterlife I found myself in. Regardless, I don't make the rules, nor will I attempt to understand them in a vain attempt to know everything. After all, why make the same mistakes in the afterlife as I did in the mortal world.

Now, the reason why my palms became sweaty upon nearing the end of the timeline is that, as you may have guessed, the final date was the date of my death. You also may have wondered why a spirit is choosing to spend time typing his recounting of life and death online, and the answer to that question is simple. I didn't have a normal life, nor did I have a normal death. I have to share what happened to me with you all simply because I feel obligated to do so. Maybe it can serve as a warning, or perhaps I feel the need to share because some things are simply too insane not to spread. Regardless, I'm already this far, so I might as well continue.

It took me quite some time to muster up the courage to download the final video. Despite mentally preparing myself for what was to come numerous times, I was still hesitant. I found myself out of the chair and pacing the room at one point, taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm myself down. It seemed like hours before I was ready to witness the most important, and most upsetting, day of my life. The day which transferred me from the land of the living to that of the dead.

Summoning each ounce of bravery within me, I clicked the link and watched as the download opened and the video automatically played. I frantically chewed at my fingernails as I watched myself in my living room, sitting comfortably in my recliner chair. I saw the coffee mug in one hand and newspaper in the other as I did what I had always done best, absorbing all the information I could. The night was black as tar and the wind sung its soft tune. I could notice all these details and more as my eyes closely watched.

It felt as if I were experiencing the event in real time, except this time, unlike my human counterpart, I knew what the outcome would be. I knew that that living, breathing person who had been me would live their last day. A life would abruptly end and I would bear witness to my own demise, and it caused my skin to crawl, my entire body trembling. It was an eerie feeling indeed.

This video was longer than the previous ones. While the others had been just thirty seconds to a minute or two at most, this one was several minutes longer in comparison. I watched myself take a quick swig of my coffee and stand up, making my way to the kitchen. This version of me... a person who I had trouble conceiving was the exact person I am.

I.. I knew the noise was coming but I didn't realize it would come so soon in the video. The sound of glass shattering filled the house as the ""alive version of me"" turned quickly and grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter, slowly making his way back into the living room. I practically screamed at the monitor in front of me, begging myself not to do what I was about to. These efforts were fruitless, of course. If I could change the past I wouldn't be in my current predicament, now would I?

I saw myself flick on the light and stare at the broken glass window in confusion. There was nobody in sight, and I had relaxed my body due to a false sense of security. It was foolish, and although my relaxation was just for a split second, it was enough. A large man in a mask pounced from behind the wall, tackling me to the floor.

I covered my eyes, not wanting to see the massacre that was destined to unfold, but morbid curiosity forced tiny creases in between my fingers to allow peepholes. I had to see... I had to see. This computer allowed me a new perspective on what had happened in my life, and I just couldn't help but watch as the man wrapped his arms around my throat, seemingly unbothered by my futile attempts to defend myself.

I leaned back in my chair and felt my body tense up as the man forced his knee into my ribs trying to cease my efforts at escaping, his grip around my throat tight as ever. Finally, after an uncomfortable amount of silence, the man released his hold on me and got up, watching over my limp body. My face was pale and my eyes were bloodshot, an expression of surprise on my face. It was the first time I had seen any emotion besides contempt within me.

I let out a long sigh of relief as the video finally came to an end and the download closed out. I placed my hand on my throat and rubbed gently. It was almost as if I felt choked just by reliving my final moments on Earth. I got up once more, pacing the perimeter of the white room. I felt sick to my stomach at the prospect of the computer. I had access to any moment in my life at the click of a button, including my own murder. I took a seat in criss-cross position at one of the four corners of the room.

It could have been anyone who killed me in all honesty. I had lots of enemies. People who I showed disdain for returned such feelings. People in the workplace, people in the neighborhood. Hell, even what was left of my family at the time had felt deep resentment towards me. Funny enough, despite the heavy torment I faced at their hands in childhood, even when I solved their issues with me of being a stupid kid they didn't seem satisfied. In truth, I don't really regret cutting them off from my life. Sure, I regret leaving some of them. Quite a few of my cousins had always treated me with respect and dignity, however, I feel no pity towards any of the others.

When I went back to the computer and turned the monitor back on, I was immediately met by something curious. There, right next to the first app, stood another. It was a notepad with a title named after me. I looked all around me, looking for any other entities within the room. There was nothing. Not only that, but there were no entry points in the room either. No doors, no windows, and upon further inspection I found no sign of hidden hatches either. There was absolutely no way another person could have gotten in, leading me to believe that the app had appeared all by itself.

Realizing once more that I truly had nothing better to do, I clicked on the notepad and watched as the document opened. Several paragraphs of text sat before me. After reading the document, I realized that unlike the video files, it didn't detail the events which took place while I was alive. Rather, it was an article describing what happened after I died. I felt my eyebrows rise while my eyes scanned the screen, taking in the information presented to me. While I can't remember the exact words I read, I can paraphrase what they said.

In summary, after I died there were several suspects the police rounded up and interrogated. I recognized each of the names listed by the article as people I had come into contact with in life. My experiences with all of them were, needless to say, negative. In all fairness, there were plenty of people who would have the motive to murder me, but not a single one was found guilty. According to the article, all who were questioned were eventually released due to ""insufficient evidence"", although I found that rather hard to believe. Despite not wanting to believe it, a part of me felt as if the case wasn't taken as seriously due to my reputation around the community. Still, none of it mattered now. Not anymore.

When I moved past that part of the article, I found that the topic had shifted from the strange circumstances surrounding my death to the impact on my community. My house had been put on the market, but nobody would buy it. Apparently, nobody would buy a house where someone had been murdered. What had once been a dead zone during the holidays became a neighborhood attraction for some of the younger kids, especially during Halloween. It was at that moment during the reading that I froze, my face completely blank. It had been... years since I died. I placed my head in my hands and took several deep breaths, which did almost nothing to calm my nerves.

Then I continued reading the article, my breathe exasperated, I saw it expanding upon the previous point in the writing. Many teenagers would dare each other on the scariest day of the year, October 31st, to spend the night near my house or, in some cases, sneak in. Apparently, tales of my mean attitude and murder spread like wildfire upon my death, causing tons of ghost stories and rumors to be told around the campfire.

I found several more video files within the notepad, which I didn't even realize could be stored there, but then again, I had learned that I couldn't expect anything ordinary now. I downloaded the links and watched several videos of teens sneaking in and out of the house at Halloween. Some spent the night, while others got too scared to stay and ran home crying. I must admit, the house did look pretty creepy. It was unkempt and probably unsafe to stay in, with cobwebs covering the porch and the paint on the outside peeled and chipped.

The inside of the house, from what I could tell, wasn't in much better condition. It was completely barren of furniture and the floor was coated in a thin layer of dust. There were very few places in the home where light could be found, mostly due to the windows being boarded up. I watched a video of a rather timid-looking kid make his way up the steps to the second story, the stairs creaking every couple of seconds.

He looked all around, taking in his surroundings. He allowed the flashlight in his right hand to illuminate the room. With that, he layed out a sleeping bag on the cold hard floor. There were dozens of kids who had done the same. Eventually, the local authorities took notice and would often have a patrol car near my house during Halloween in order to make sure no kids were trespassing. Once again I was taken back by the amount of time that had passed since my death. Perhaps it had been longer than I thought.

Finally, the kids stopped showing up, and so did the police. I could feel my heart sink a little at that. Something about the fun the kids had, while juvenile, reminded me of the some of the fun I missed out on as a boy, and the fact that their fun was ending somewhat saddened me. I looked at the article and saw it come to an abrupt end, to which I closed the notepad and returned my gaze to the monitor home screen. Rubbing my eyes in fatigue, I felt the incoming sensation of sleep. I found it odd how I could feel sleepy in the afterlife, but I suppose it's pretty tiring to see what I had. I felt myself drifting off, and without much thought, I allowed sleep to embrace me.

I woke up the day after, or at least I think it was the day after. I had no concept of time within that white room, and I was disappointed upon waking up to find that nothing had changed. I was afraid that all the afterlife would provide me was contemplation in the form of this computer in front of me. Stretching my hand forward and gripping the mouse, I shook it a little to wake the monitor up. The background had changed from a purely blue screen to a black and white checkerboard style image.

Once again I looked around the room for any place someone could enter and alter the computer, only to find nothing again. Shifting my attention back to the screen, I noticed one more item that hadn't been there the previous day. It was a folder, and upon opening it I found a page titled ""Instructions"". It was in an application which I was unfamiliar with, but I proceeded in opening it anyways.

Inside was a single link. Figuring there was no harm in clicking one more, I hovered my mouse above it. However, I hesitated. Something about this link seemed odd to me. This wasn't like the others and I knew it, but I had no idea how. Still... there was only one way to find out where it lead. Sighing, I tapped the mouse and opened the link. And once I did so, my vision went black.

For a single moment in time, I thought I had gone blind, and it terrified me. The white room surrounding me was gone and replaced with darkness, and for that split second I wanted to scream, but couldn't. I couldn't do anything really, and it was awful. I would say my heart was pounding against my chest but I couldn't feel my heartbeat, nor was I sure if I had a chest or body at all for that matter.

I couldn't feel my own existence. It was like for a moment I stopped existing within reality, becoming an abstract being. I didn't exist, yet I did. That's as best as I could describe that odd, terrifying sensation. As soon as it started it stopped, and I was snapped back into reality. I stumbled a bit and fell to my knees, gasping for air as I felt beads of sweat running down my face. It was amazing how alive and human I felt even as a spirit. My blurred vision finally came into focus and fixated on the floor beneath me.

The first thing that I noticed was that the floor wasn't white, meaning I wasn't inside the room I had become so familiar with. Instead, the floor was wooden and cold, coated in a thin layer of dust. I stood to my knees and looked around, taking in various features around me. Recognizable features which allowed me to easily identify the place I was in. It was my own house.

It looked the same as it had through the videos I saw while kids searched through it. I saw the same boarded windows, heard the same creaking floorboards... yes, it was mine alright. I was confused as to why I was there, and I felt my heart speed up as I noticed where I was standing. It was the exact same spot as where my murder had taken place.

Feeling uncomfortable with where I was, I moved to the front door and placed my hand on the cold doorknob. I tried turning it but to no avail. The door wouldn't open. I looked down at the lock, only to see that it wasn't turned. I grasped the doorknob and frantically began turning, unable to exit the house. I rushed to the back door and found that the same thing happened.

I pushed up on the windows not boarded and found that no matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't budge. I was trapped inside my own house, with no way to escape. I pounded my fists on the door and screamed at the top of my lungs despite knowing damn well that not a soul in the world could hear me.

My body found itself slumped over in front of the back door, twiddling my thumbs and tapping my foot lightly. I took several deep breaths in an attempt to distract myself from my situation and tried thinking of some sort of solution. Why had what happened, happened? Why view my entire life in rewind and study my legacy after death just to be trapped in the very house I was killed in? It was madness.

I slammed my fist against the floor in a fit of rage and got up once more, clutching my head and violently pulling at strands of my hair. After several minutes spent in frustration, I allowed myself to settle down and explore my now abandoned home. I figured that there was no point in getting too worked up over it anyway.

I made my way up the stairs and down the hallway. Despite the second story being completely enveloped in darkness, I found it quite easy to see and navigate, as if I had my own set of built-in night vision. At the end of the corridor was a door to my room. There was something odd about it, and it wasn't a subtle type of odd either. A fluorescent glow emitted from within the room, shining brightly through the cracks. I made my way towards this glow and, much to my approval, I found I was able to open the door.

Upon entering I realized that glow coming from a computer screen within the room. It was my computer, inexplicably clean and in the same spot it had always been despite the rest of the house being bare. I lifted the computer and realized that a fine layer of dust say underneath where the computer was, which should have been impossible had a solid object truly been on top of it. I had realized that this wasn't my computer, but something provided to me as a tool. It was my very own resource and I found that it came equipped with apps and an internet connection.

I couldn't explain this at all... but something was allowing me to communicate to the outside world. What seemed like a blessing in disguise, however, would turn out to be my only way to share to you this story and what follows. It wouldn't turn out to be a convenient device as a gift, but a way to retell the painful experience that is to follow,

The other thing I noticed about the computer was the date and time. Wondering what time and day it was, I looked, only for my eyes to widen. The date was October 31st.

It was the morning of Halloween, and it was then that I realized my presence within my house was no coincidence. I was meant to be here, on this very night. I remembered my thoughts in the past. If you recall, the kids within the neighborhood would gather around my house at Halloween, each daring each other to enter the old abandoned house where a murder took place years ago. I wondered, however, about the police, until I then recalled their absence recently as the teenagers died down. I then realized that because of the lack of law enforcement specifically in front of my house, there was a possibility that they would be back and enter once more.

A smile grew onto my face as I realized that my dismay upon hearing these kids and their mischievous fun would come to an end would now be invalidated. My smile only grew wider at the prospect that perhaps I would be able to help these kids have fun and do their fair share of devious acts, seeing as how I was too foolish and full of myself as a young lad to do so myself, thus losing part of my very childhood. Yes, I understood my purpose. I was to haunt the very house I was killed in. While that idea might have sounded very unsettling to the average man, I was excited to relive a part of my life I missed out on.

I peered out into the brightly lit road and observed the houses in the distance. Many cheap Halloween decorations adorned the neighborhood, and I saw a few young kids board a bright yellow school bus. I had the whole day to prepare for the night to come. I chuckled to myself. They had no idea what they were in for.

As the sun withdrew from the sky and fell below the horizon, I saw dozens of kids running out of their homes, candy bags gripped tightly within their hands. They skipped and galloped down the road with plastic masks portraying witches and ghouls and all sorts of creatures of darkness. To each house in view, they approached with glee and knocked upon the doors. They laughed joyously as candy was emptied into their bags and moved onto the next houses. None of them stopped at mine though.

The evening progressed, and the night grew darker. The moon stood high in the night sky and provided a comforting light in every direction. Many of the younger kids had gone home by that point, and only a few teenagers remained. My heart fell as a thought formed in the back of my mind. What if nobody tried staying the night? What if they were too afraid of police confrontation to take the risk?

I didn't want to believe it. This was my chance to make up for my failure in life and help those currently living. Yet, I wouldn't get that chance, would I? Figuring the night was a failure, I laid down on the floor and placed my arms under my head, resting my eyes. I allowed my body to relax and breathed out deeply . Did you know spirits can dream? I didn't, but I know now. I found myself lucidly dreaming that night, sitting within my old recliner chair. Well, it wasn't me who was sitting. I couldn't quite see who the person was because their face was hidden behind the newspaper they held. I approached them slowly, clearing my throat and tightening my fist. I placed my hand on the top of the paper and pulled it down, attempting to find out who the man was. Then, I jumped back, startled and afraid.

There, sitting in the recliner chair, sat a large man in a mask. He threw down the paper and leaped to his feet, approaching me with surprising speed. I fell backward and hit my head on the wall, and I watched in terror as his hand opened and wrapped around my throat, choking me.

I struggled for air as my face turned blue. My lungs felt as if they were on fire, and I scraped and clawed at the man's arms and face, attempting to sink my nails into his skin and draw bled. Trying to do anything I could to free myself of his grip.

I couldn't. I was too weak to stop my assailant, and I felt myself slipping. I felt the veins bulging from underneath my skin as my eyes became bloodshot. It felt as if they would pop out from the sockets. It felt so real... as if I would die once more. I was reliving my worst moment. Every second of it, I felt. It was all so familiar to me. The furniture around the room within my dream had been knocked over in the struggle, and here I was, death slowly approaching me.

Of that entire ordeal, the most horrifying moment to me was when my entire body went limp, yet I could still see. I could still see, breathe, and feel. I was conscious and aware, trapped inside of a dead body. I was completely and utterly out of control, like a session of sleep paralysis. I watched as the man released me from his grip and stood over me, admiring his work. I witnessed him slip his fingers underneath his mask, pulling upwards. What I saw underneath that black, foreboding mask will forever be ingrained into my mind for eternity.

It was me... it was my face. I saw it clear as day. My skin was pale and slightly blue. The eyes were bloodshot as they had been upon my death, and worms wriggled around through open holes and wounds caused by the process of decay. A mixture of mud and grass filled the thing's mouth, leaving little to no room for the being to speak. I struggled to comprehend what was happening as the figure grabbed a black shovel seemingly out of nowhere.

The monstrosity moved out of sight and I heard the sounds of wooden floorboards being removed. As soon as the thing was done with that task, I heard the sound of dirt being removed from the ground. Within minutes the creature was done with its job and lifted me with superhuman strength, tossing me into the hole it had just made.

My screams were muffled by my inability to open my mouth as the thing shoveled the dirt on top of me. As the earth filled my makeshift tomb, my sight was lost. The last thing I heard was the faint laughter coming from the creature that had reenacted my murder. A creature that appeared to be me, but wasn't...It was jeering me.

I sat up abruptly, drenched in my own sweat and tears. I shifted into a fetal position, rocking back and forth while a million thoughts rushed through my mind. What the hell just happened? Did I really see what I thought I had? There was no way in hell it was real... any of it! I shivered and shook and I just couldn't sit still and nothing made sense. That nightmare had shaken me to my core and I wiped my forehead. I hadn't felt that type of fear since the date of my death. I thought there would be nothing to fear after death, but I was wrong. Maybe nothing can hurt or kill me anymore, but the memories and nightmares which plague me will remain forever.

Not only would my murder dominate my dreams completely, but I wondered, and feared, whether my regrets in life would as well. I wondered if the loneliness I experienced at my own hand would eventually get to me. I felt tears well up within my eyes as I struggled to find a reason behind any of this. I hadn't a clue why and I may never have a clue. The afterlife is supposed to be eternal bliss. The sweet release of death was supposed to help liberate us from the problems of life but they seem to follow us into death.

Perhaps it is a blessing, or perhaps it is a curse. Would I be able to feel happy if such feelings and issues didn't follow us? This truth will forever elude me most likely, but it is something I feel the need to ponder. Yes, it is quite ironic that I do perhaps even more thinking here than I do in life. However, over time I have come to believe that our motivations and intentions behind our actions determine their effect and morality. I myself am a good example of this.

The computer provided to me allowed me to write down notes such as these for further contemplation in the future, as well as reflect on ideas in the past. The Halloween night I described earlier happened about two years ago. After that night, I found myself trapped within my own house until the following Halloween. Luckily enough for me, time seemed to progress faster than it normally would until that day. The house seemed to be pretty devoid of activity until that Halloween though, so I myself had to find entertainment in other activities such as, well, writing.

I wrote about my experiences within the computer, this being one such story, and it keeps me sane. I suppose that's another reason why I was presented this hunk of junk replica of my past life laptop. It's a good way to be active and kept up to date while in the very confined world I live in.

The nightmares I had kept on coming. I'd say they occurred about once every week or two. Some of them were harsh, such as the one where I had to live through my murder again. Others weren't nearly as bad but still caused me to feel sick to my stomach, such as witnessing several life-changing moments in which I pushed family away. Such dreams confirmed my theory about certain moments in my life full with negative connotations coming back to haunt me.

I was convinced for some time that the nightmares I had were, in part, punishment for my actions in life as a cruel and negligent man. However, nothing else in the afterworld really seemed to back up this idea, so it is just another theory of mine for now. There are still many questions I have that I am unsure how to answer, so I may seem uncertain a lot of times. In truth, life after death doesn't truly answer our questions about the universe. I've no clue if this experience happening to me is similar to other spirits. Thus, with no comparison to offer, I cannot offer with certainty that events such as this will be similar to others.

When last year's Halloween arrived, I was filled with hope once more. It was a promising day, and I would pray that someone would dare enter my home. Again I saw the kids in their plastic masks and neat costumes skip down the road for a night of trick-or-treating. Just like every year before, they would go up to a neighborhood house, knock on the door, and joyfully accept their delicious treats. The night went on, the kids got their candy, and they all avoided my house once again.

A frown formed on my face as I lost hope, realizing that it would be another boring Halloween for me. I hung my head low and made my way over to my spot on the floor, lazily sitting with my legs spread out haphazardly. I leaned my head against the wall and listened to the sounds of the children's fun dissipate. The moon had risen once more, and the children made their way back to their homes.

Breathing out slowly, I prepared to fall asleep once more. Well, until I heard a strange noise outside the house. I opened my eyes and shifted my head toward the back door where the sound originated. I saw several shadows moving around outside the window, soft murmurs accompanying the motion.

I sat up, my interest peaked. Could it be what I thought it was? Could it be what I had been hoping for all those years? I got my answer in the form of the window near the back door sliding open and a small boy stealthily making his way into the house. He couldn't have been more than 15 years old.

9rz8cm,3,2018-10-27,The Afterlife Can Be an Unusual Place (Horror story I wrote),Chris183539,horror,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/9rz8cm/the_afterlife_can_be_an_unusual_place_horror/,"Hello there dearest reader. Before we get started, allow me to introduce myself. My earthly name was Marcus Wade. I’m not entirely sure what the purpose of sharing my personal accounts with you is, but maybe I do it just because I can. You can make your own assumptions as you go, but I’d rather not go on a tangent for too long before the story. So, allow me to tell you about my experiences in the afterlife. I think they may interest you. Maybe things will change in the future, and if they do, I will continue to describe such experiences to you. For now, I present you with what I know and have seen as of now. Events which shaped my life after death and continue to do so.

I awoke, yet I did not remember falling asleep. Perhaps that is death, if you can even call the process in which I experienced death. Can something which never was truly alive be deceased? I ask that as a man without a family or a legacy to call my own. All I saw around me was nothingness. I say nothingness because there exists no language within the mortal world to describe where I found myself, and that was when I realized my worth.

I learned that I only ever amounted to all of which those who lived and died before me discovered, and my progression of thought and discovery would come to a halt once I discovered true omniscience. Yet, true omniscience was a fallacy. A myth created so the foolish people such as I would find themselves on a wild goose chase to self-proclaimed superiority rather than become progressive members of society. Sound pretentious? That’s because that was who I was as a man. So there I sat, unmissed by anyone, and totally unfazed by the fact that I was in the afterlife.

A state of clarity had washed over me once I found myself in this strange place. It was as if all my foolish were exposed and I was enlightened to the truth and the difference between right and wrong. Throughout my life, I was completely obsessed with learning as much as I could, so I could prove to those who doubted me I was better than they had assumed I was.

Now that I was dead, I could only be surrounded by thoughts and memories as my mind expanded further and I came to understand what I hadn't before. Fitting wasn’t it? As a man whose sole purpose was discovery and intelligence, this newfound knowledge could only be described as a euphoric feeling to me. Heavenly, if you will. Yes, this was Heaven. It had to be, for what else could possibly be concluded based on the information at hand?

I found myself uncomfortable at first. The sensation of being a sentient, yet disembodied was strange due to the amount of time I had previously spent as a living, breathing person, but I soon got used to my circumstances. I had all the time in the world to think, and so that is exactly what I did. I sat there for as long as I can remember, pondering over past events and actions. Some of them I took great pride in, whilst I kicked myself over my own stupidity when recalling others.

It felt like an eternity before I saw it. Some sort of bright light penetrated my vision, and I was finally able to see the world around me. A perfectly rectangular room, devoid of any furniture, was what I saw. I looked down and saw a hand. It was my own... I had seemingly regained my mortal body once more. The walls and floor of the room were in pristine condition, and everything appeared in a white coating of paint. In the center of the room sat a single white desk, where a large desktop computer sat mounted on top of it.

I slowly made my way over to the old-fashioned equipment and sat in the chair, pushing the power button to the computer. I heard the soft humming of the machinery as the screen faintly lit up, revealing a blue background screen and a single application in the center. I moved the mouse until the pointer hovered over the app, my curiosity at its peak. Then, I clicked twice and watched as a brand new page popped up in front of me, filling the screen entirely.

I watched as a plethora of dates and times appeared before my eyes, each accompanied by a video file. Unsure of what any of this meant, I clicked on the very first link. Upon doing so, a downloadable file appeared, which I opened. Much to my surprise, the download automatically started playing the video within it. I saw a woman in a hospital bed. The expression on her face was that of pain, and I heard her crying in agony as various doctors and nurses did their best to comfort her.

The woman was someone who I had recognized. She was... she was my own mother. After several minutes of her exasperated wailing, one of the doctors lifted up a small child, showing my mother as pride and joy filled her eyes. As soon as the video ended, the download file closed out and I was returned back to the original web page. For a minute, I was left speechless. Upon looking at the file more closely, I recognized the date on it as my birthday. Before me was every single important event in my life.

I took the time to watch a few of these videos, of course. Several birthdays of mine, my first girlfriend, my first few cars and homes. There were hundreds, if not thousands of videos detailing some of the best times of my life. I sat in awe as I watched the early days of my childhood replaying right in front of me. It was truly one of the most fascinating moments I had ever experienced. This fascination, however, was short-lived. Soon, I felt a new, much less pleasant feeling. One of disappointment and regret. I am referring to the events which took place in my life after my childhood.

Now, I had been aware of the poor decisions I had made in life before I found the mysterious computer room. In fact, it was some of those very memories in which I had pondered in my previous state. However, there is a large difference between recalling something and actually witnessing it again with your own eyes. For instance, when I had remembered my various arguments with my parents, the kids and teachers at school mocking me for my low intelligence and work ethic, the feelings associated with such events didn't shake me up as much as viewing my bullies and relatives berate me with insults, believing I would end up as a nobody or some hooligan on the streets.

Even more disheartening was that there were more download links involving the negative aspects of my life than there were positive ones. It is a sad fact of life that adulthood lasts far longer than childhood, and my adult years grew even more depressing as the slow, definite march of time continued. Still, there was nothing I could do within my afterlife except watch as my pathetic life devolved from the innocence of a child to the contempt of a grumpy man, so I continued.

When those closest to me had doubted my ability to progress at the rate of the other children, I personally took it upon myself to prove them wrong. As a young boy with very few friends or hobbies, such a task became my passion, and I spent nearly all my time with my nose stuck in any book I could get my hands on.

I completely ignored any other entertaining activity a boy my age would gladly partake in, even opting to study on my birthday and other fun events in my life. Thus, as my high school years started, I isolated myself from all distractions in order to prove myself capable of outsmarting anyone who dared doubt me. As you can imagine from someone like me, I considered people distractions as well, causing many relationships with the few friends and family I had to shatter completely. These were the years that marked the beginning of my downfall.

After reviewing my teenage years, I decided to move on. I clicked on the scrollbar and dragged it downwards, waiting a bit before stopping once more and selecting a new date. I was an adult at that point in time, and my studying and hard work had paid off. Well, paid off as far as financial security was involved. Despite being socially inept and losing most of those I cared for, I carried on with my anti-social tendencies until I found myself in a good college and got into a well-paying job. I had moved up the ranks rather quickly in the workplace, soon becoming a top-ranking supervisor who enjoyed commanding my orderlies around like they were dogs.

I sat in my chair in disbelief as I watched the smug grin on my face while I barked out instructions to colleagues and interns alike. The nerve I had to treat others such a way. Perhaps it was the afterlife and the newfound clarity and sensibility I discovered upon entering it that allowed me to see clearly the problems with my behavior. It also allowed me to see the scowls and rude remarks muttered under the breath of various employees who looked upon me in disgust. I had been blind to such things in my human state, but apparently, I wasn't anymore.

This behavior wasn't just common in the workplace, but outside of it as well. It wasn't long before the neighborhood came to realize my rather distasteful tendencies and steered clear of me altogether, to which I paid them no mind. It was my choice and mine alone to live a life of solitude, and for the longest time, I was known as the mean old man who lived at the end of the block.

I never smiled, nor did I ever laugh. The very few people who saw me outside of my house or outside of work only ever saw me with a scowl permanently sewn to my face. I didn't decorate for Christmas or Halloween. I didn't send or receive gifts or partake in the many activities within the community. If there was precious work to be done or information to be learned, I focused all of my attention on it.

Speaking of Halloween, I found a few video files around that holiday. I decided to watch some of them and found that even though I never had a single frightening prop out on my porch or yard, not one kid within the area would come near my residence. I actually found myself chucking at this fact, figuring their parents must have warned them about the scary old fart who would surely throw a fit should he be disturbed, regardless of the circumstances. My curiosity started withering away as I clicked on the scroll bar and continued downwards. It was at that moment that I realized I had almost reached the bottom of the page, and only a few downloads remained.

They were nothing special really. Just a few videos of me lashing out at some more people who dared commit the heinous crime of trying to socially interact with me. Yeah, I'm surprised I made it into heaven again in this first place. Then again, it was never made apparent where I was. As far as I knew it wasn't heaven, but just some random phase of the afterlife I found myself in. Regardless, I don't make the rules, nor will I attempt to understand them in a vain attempt to know everything. After all, why make the same mistakes in the afterlife as I did in the mortal world.

Now, the reason why my palms became sweaty upon nearing the end of the timeline is that, as you may have guessed, the final date was the date of my death. You also may have wondered why a spirit is choosing to spend time typing his recounting of life and death online, and the answer to that question is simple. I didn't have a normal life, nor did I have a normal death. I have to share what happened to me with you all simply because I feel obligated to do so. Maybe it can serve as a warning, or perhaps I feel the need to share because some things are simply too insane not to spread. Regardless, I'm already this far, so I might as well continue.

It took me quite some time to muster up the courage to download the final video. Despite mentally preparing myself for what was to come numerous times, I was still hesitant. I found myself out of the chair and pacing the room at one point, taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm myself down. It seemed like hours before I was ready to witness the most important, and most upsetting, day of my life. The day which transferred me from the land of the living to that of the dead.

Summoning each ounce of bravery within me, I clicked the link and watched as the download opened and the video automatically played. I frantically chewed at my fingernails as I watched myself in my living room, sitting comfortably in my recliner chair. I saw the coffee mug in one hand and newspaper in the other as I did what I had always done best, absorbing all the information I could. The night was black as tar and the wind sung its soft tune. I could notice all these details and more as my eyes closely watched.

It felt as if I were experiencing the event in real time, except this time, unlike my human counterpart, I knew what the outcome would be. I knew that that living, breathing person who had been me would live their last day. A life would abruptly end and I would bear witness to my own demise, and it caused my skin to crawl, my entire body trembling. It was an eerie feeling indeed.

This video was longer than the previous ones. While the others had been just thirty seconds to a minute or two at most, this one was several minutes longer in comparison. I watched myself take a quick swig of my coffee and stand up, making my way to the kitchen. This version of me... a person who I had trouble conceiving was the exact person I am.

I.. I knew the noise was coming but I didn't realize it would come so soon in the video. The sound of glass shattering filled the house as the ""alive version of me"" turned quickly and grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter, slowly making his way back into the living room. I practically screamed at the monitor in front of me, begging myself not to do what I was about to. These efforts were fruitless, of course. If I could change the past I wouldn't be in my current predicament, now would I?

I saw myself flick on the light and stare at the broken glass window in confusion. There was nobody in sight, and I had relaxed my body due to a false sense of security. It was foolish, and although my relaxation was just for a split second, it was enough. A large man in a mask pounced from behind the wall, tackling me to the floor.

I covered my eyes, not wanting to see the massacre that was destined to unfold, but morbid curiosity forced tiny creases in between my fingers to allow peepholes. I had to see... I had to see. This computer allowed me a new perspective on what had happened in my life, and I just couldn't help but watch as the man wrapped his arms around my throat, seemingly unbothered by my futile attempts to defend myself.

I leaned back in my chair and felt my body tense up as the man forced his knee into my ribs trying to cease my efforts at escaping, his grip around my throat tight as ever. Finally, after an uncomfortable amount of silence, the man released his hold on me and got up, watching over my limp body. My face was pale and my eyes were bloodshot, an expression of surprise on my face. It was the first time I had seen any emotion besides contempt within me.

I let out a long sigh of relief as the video finally came to an end and the download closed out. I placed my hand on my throat and rubbed gently. It was almost as if I felt choked just by reliving my final moments on Earth. I got up once more, pacing the perimeter of the white room. I felt sick to my stomach at the prospect of the computer. I had access to any moment in my life at the click of a button, including my own murder. I took a seat in criss-cross position at one of the four corners of the room.

It could have been anyone who killed me in all honesty. I had lots of enemies. People who I showed disdain for returned such feelings. People in the workplace, people in the neighborhood. Hell, even what was left of my family at the time had felt deep resentment towards me. Funny enough, despite the heavy torment I faced at their hands in childhood, even when I solved their issues with me of being a stupid kid they didn't seem satisfied. In truth, I don't really regret cutting them off from my life. Sure, I regret leaving some of them. Quite a few of my cousins had always treated me with respect and dignity, however, I feel no pity towards any of the others.

When I went back to the computer and turned the monitor back on, I was immediately met by something curious. There, right next to the first app, stood another. It was a notepad with a title named after me. I looked all around me, looking for any other entities within the room. There was nothing. Not only that, but there were no entry points in the room either. No doors, no windows, and upon further inspection I found no sign of hidden hatches either. There was absolutely no way another person could have gotten in, leading me to believe that the app had appeared all by itself.

Realizing once more that I truly had nothing better to do, I clicked on the notepad and watched as the document opened. Several paragraphs of text sat before me. After reading the document, I realized that unlike the video files, it didn't detail the events which took place while I was alive. Rather, it was an article describing what happened after I died. I felt my eyebrows rise while my eyes scanned the screen, taking in the information presented to me. While I can't remember the exact words I read, I can paraphrase what they said.

In summary, after I died there were several suspects the police rounded up and interrogated. I recognized each of the names listed by the article as people I had come into contact with in life. My experiences with all of them were, needless to say, negative. In all fairness, there were plenty of people who would have the motive to murder me, but not a single one was found guilty. According to the article, all who were questioned were eventually released due to ""insufficient evidence"", although I found that rather hard to believe. Despite not wanting to believe it, a part of me felt as if the case wasn't taken as seriously due to my reputation around the community. Still, none of it mattered now. Not anymore.

When I moved past that part of the article, I found that the topic had shifted from the strange circumstances surrounding my death to the impact on my community. My house had been put on the market, but nobody would buy it. Apparently, nobody would buy a house where someone had been murdered. What had once been a dead zone during the holidays became a neighborhood attraction for some of the younger kids, especially during Halloween. It was at that moment during the reading that I froze, my face completely blank. It had been... years since I died. I placed my head in my hands and took several deep breaths, which did almost nothing to calm my nerves.

Then I continued reading the article, my breathe exasperated, I saw it expanding upon the previous point in the writing. Many teenagers would dare each other on the scariest day of the year, October 31st, to spend the night near my house or, in some cases, sneak in. Apparently, tales of my mean attitude and murder spread like wildfire upon my death, causing tons of ghost stories and rumors to be told around the campfire.

I found several more video files within the notepad, which I didn't even realize could be stored there, but then again, I had learned that I couldn't expect anything ordinary now. I downloaded the links and watched several videos of teens sneaking in and out of the house at Halloween. Some spent the night, while others got too scared to stay and ran home crying. I must admit, the house did look pretty creepy. It was unkempt and probably unsafe to stay in, with cobwebs covering the porch and the paint on the outside peeled and chipped.

The inside of the house, from what I could tell, wasn't in much better condition. It was completely barren of furniture and the floor was coated in a thin layer of dust. There were very few places in the home where light could be found, mostly due to the windows being boarded up. I watched a video of a rather timid-looking kid make his way up the steps to the second story, the stairs creaking every couple of seconds.

He looked all around, taking in his surroundings. He allowed the flashlight in his right hand to illuminate the room. With that, he layed out a sleeping bag on the cold hard floor. There were dozens of kids who had done the same. Eventually, the local authorities took notice and would often have a patrol car near my house during Halloween in order to make sure no kids were trespassing. Once again I was taken back by the amount of time that had passed since my death. Perhaps it had been longer than I thought.

Finally, the kids stopped showing up, and so did the police. I could feel my heart sink a little at that. Something about the fun the kids had, while juvenile, reminded me of the some of the fun I missed out on as a boy, and the fact that their fun was ending somewhat saddened me. I looked at the article and saw it come to an abrupt end, to which I closed the notepad and returned my gaze to the monitor home screen. Rubbing my eyes in fatigue, I felt the incoming sensation of sleep. I found it odd how I could feel sleepy in the afterlife, but I suppose it's pretty tiring to see what I had. I felt myself drifting off, and without much thought, I allowed sleep to embrace me.

I woke up the day after, or at least I think it was the day after. I had no concept of time within that white room, and I was disappointed upon waking up to find that nothing had changed. I was afraid that all the afterlife would provide me was contemplation in the form of this computer in front of me. Stretching my hand forward and gripping the mouse, I shook it a little to wake the monitor up. The background had changed from a purely blue screen to a black and white checkerboard style image.

Once again I looked around the room for any place someone could enter and alter the computer, only to find nothing again. Shifting my attention back to the screen, I noticed one more item that hadn't been there the previous day. It was a folder, and upon opening it I found a page titled ""Instructions"". It was in an application which I was unfamiliar with, but I proceeded in opening it anyways.

Inside was a single link. Figuring there was no harm in clicking one more, I hovered my mouse above it. However, I hesitated. Something about this link seemed odd to me. This wasn't like the others and I knew it, but I had no idea how. Still... there was only one way to find out where it lead. Sighing, I tapped the mouse and opened the link. And once I did so, my vision went black.

For a single moment in time, I thought I had gone blind, and it terrified me. The white room surrounding me was gone and replaced with darkness, and for that split second I wanted to scream, but couldn't. I couldn't do anything really, and it was awful. I would say my heart was pounding against my chest but I couldn't feel my heartbeat, nor was I sure if I had a chest or body at all for that matter.

I couldn't feel my own existence. It was like for a moment I stopped existing within reality, becoming an abstract being. I didn't exist, yet I did. That's as best as I could describe that odd, terrifying sensation. As soon as it started it stopped, and I was snapped back into reality. I stumbled a bit and fell to my knees, gasping for air as I felt beads of sweat running down my face. It was amazing how alive and human I felt even as a spirit. My blurred vision finally came into focus and fixated on the floor beneath me.

The first thing that I noticed was that the floor wasn't white, meaning I wasn't inside the room I had become so familiar with. Instead, the floor was wooden and cold, coated in a thin layer of dust. I stood to my knees and looked around, taking in various features around me. Recognizable features which allowed me to easily identify the place I was in. It was my own house.

It looked the same as it had through the videos I saw while kids searched through it. I saw the same boarded windows, heard the same creaking floorboards... yes, it was mine alright. I was confused as to why I was there, and I felt my heart speed up as I noticed where I was standing. It was the exact same spot as where my murder had taken place.

Feeling uncomfortable with where I was, I moved to the front door and placed my hand on the cold doorknob. I tried turning it but to no avail. The door wouldn't open. I looked down at the lock, only to see that it wasn't turned. I grasped the doorknob and frantically began turning, unable to exit the house. I rushed to the back door and found that the same thing happened.

I pushed up on the windows not boarded and found that no matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't budge. I was trapped inside my own house, with no way to escape. I pounded my fists on the door and screamed at the top of my lungs despite knowing damn well that not a soul in the world could hear me.

My body found itself slumped over in front of the back door, twiddling my thumbs and tapping my foot lightly. I took several deep breaths in an attempt to distract myself from my situation and tried thinking of some sort of solution. Why had what happened, happened? Why view my entire life in rewind and study my legacy after death just to be trapped in the very house I was killed in? It was madness.

I slammed my fist against the floor in a fit of rage and got up once more, clutching my head and violently pulling at strands of my hair. After several minutes spent in frustration, I allowed myself to settle down and explore my now abandoned home. I figured that there was no point in getting too worked up over it anyway.

I made my way up the stairs and down the hallway. Despite the second story being completely enveloped in darkness, I found it quite easy to see and navigate, as if I had my own set of built-in night vision. At the end of the corridor was a door to my room. There was something odd about it, and it wasn't a subtle type of odd either. A fluorescent glow emitted from within the room, shining brightly through the cracks. I made my way towards this glow and, much to my approval, I found I was able to open the door.

Upon entering I realized that glow coming from a computer screen within the room. It was my computer, inexplicably clean and in the same spot it had always been despite the rest of the house being bare. I lifted the computer and realized that a fine layer of dust say underneath where the computer was, which should have been impossible had a solid object truly been on top of it. I had realized that this wasn't my computer, but something provided to me as a tool. It was my very own resource and I found that it came equipped with apps and an internet connection.

I couldn't explain this at all... but something was allowing me to communicate to the outside world. What seemed like a blessing in disguise, however, would turn out to be my only way to share to you this story and what follows. It wouldn't turn out to be a convenient device as a gift, but a way to retell the painful experience that is to follow,

The other thing I noticed about the computer was the date and time. Wondering what time and day it was, I looked, only for my eyes to widen. The date was October 31st.

It was the morning of Halloween, and it was then that I realized my presence within my house was no coincidence. I was meant to be here, on this very night. I remembered my thoughts in the past. If you recall, the kids within the neighborhood would gather around my house at Halloween, each daring each other to enter the old abandoned house where a murder took place years ago. I wondered, however, about the police, until I then recalled their absence recently as the teenagers died down. I then realized that because of the lack of law enforcement specifically in front of my house, there was a possibility that they would be back and enter once more.

A smile grew onto my face as I realized that my dismay upon hearing these kids and their mischievous fun would come to an end would now be invalidated. My smile only grew wider at the prospect that perhaps I would be able to help these kids have fun and do their fair share of devious acts, seeing as how I was too foolish and full of myself as a young lad to do so myself, thus losing part of my very childhood. Yes, I understood my purpose. I was to haunt the very house I was killed in. While that idea might have sounded very unsettling to the average man, I was excited to relive a part of my life I missed out on.

I peered out into the brightly lit road and observed the houses in the distance. Many cheap Halloween decorations adorned the neighborhood, and I saw a few young kids board a bright yellow school bus. I had the whole day to prepare for the night to come. I chuckled to myself. They had no idea what they were in for.

As the sun withdrew from the sky and fell below the horizon, I saw dozens of kids running out of their homes, candy bags gripped tightly within their hands. They skipped and galloped down the road with plastic masks portraying witches and ghouls and all sorts of creatures of darkness. To each house in view, they approached with glee and knocked upon the doors. They laughed joyously as candy was emptied into their bags and moved onto the next houses. None of them stopped at mine though.

The evening progressed, and the night grew darker. The moon stood high in the night sky and provided a comforting light in every direction. Many of the younger kids had gone home by that point, and only a few teenagers remained. My heart fell as a thought formed in the back of my mind. What if nobody tried staying the night? What if they were too afraid of police confrontation to take the risk?

I didn't want to believe it. This was my chance to make up for my failure in life and help those currently living. Yet, I wouldn't get that chance, would I? Figuring the night was a failure, I laid down on the floor and placed my arms under my head, resting my eyes. I allowed my body to relax and breathed out deeply . Did you know spirits can dream? I didn't, but I know now. I found myself lucidly dreaming that night, sitting within my old recliner chair. Well, it wasn't me who was sitting. I couldn't quite see who the person was because their face was hidden behind the newspaper they held. I approached them slowly, clearing my throat and tightening my fist. I placed my hand on the top of the paper and pulled it down, attempting to find out who the man was. Then, I jumped back, startled and afraid.

There, sitting in the recliner chair, sat a large man in a mask. He threw down the paper and leaped to his feet, approaching me with surprising speed. I fell backward and hit my head on the wall, and I watched in terror as his hand opened and wrapped around my throat, choking me.

I struggled for air as my face turned blue. My lungs felt as if they were on fire, and I scraped and clawed at the man's arms and face, attempting to sink my nails into his skin and draw bled. Trying to do anything I could to free myself of his grip.

I couldn't. I was too weak to stop my assailant, and I felt myself slipping. I felt the veins bulging from underneath my skin as my eyes became bloodshot. It felt as if they would pop out from the sockets. It felt so real... as if I would die once more. I was reliving my worst moment. Every second of it, I felt. It was all so familiar to me. The furniture around the room within my dream had been knocked over in the struggle, and here I was, death slowly approaching me.

Of that entire ordeal, the most horrifying moment to me was when my entire body went limp, yet I could still see. I could still see, breathe, and feel. I was conscious and aware, trapped inside of a dead body. I was completely and utterly out of control, like a session of sleep paralysis. I watched as the man released me from his grip and stood over me, admiring his work. I witnessed him slip his fingers underneath his mask, pulling upwards. What I saw underneath that black, foreboding mask will forever be ingrained into my mind for eternity.

It was me... it was my face. I saw it clear as day. My skin was pale and slightly blue. The eyes were bloodshot as they had been upon my death, and worms wriggled around through open holes and wounds caused by the process of decay. A mixture of mud and grass filled the thing's mouth, leaving little to no room for the being to speak. I struggled to comprehend what was happening as the figure grabbed a black shovel seemingly out of nowhere.

The monstrosity moved out of sight and I heard the sounds of wooden floorboards being removed. As soon as the thing was done with that task, I heard the sound of dirt being removed from the ground. Within minutes the creature was done with its job and lifted me with superhuman strength, tossing me into the hole it had just made.

My screams were muffled by my inability to open my mouth as the thing shoveled the dirt on top of me. As the earth filled my makeshift tomb, my sight was lost. The last thing I heard was the faint laughter coming from the creature that had reenacted my murder. A creature that appeared to be me, but wasn't...It was jeering me.

I sat up abruptly, drenched in my own sweat and tears. I shifted into a fetal position, rocking back and forth while a million thoughts rushed through my mind. What the hell just happened? Did I really see what I thought I had? There was no way in hell it was real... any of it! I shivered and shook and I just couldn't sit still and nothing made sense. That nightmare had shaken me to my core and I wiped my forehead. I hadn't felt that type of fear since the date of my death. I thought there would be nothing to fear after death, but I was wrong. Maybe nothing can hurt or kill me anymore, but the memories and nightmares which plague me will remain forever.

Not only would my murder dominate my dreams completely, but I wondered, and feared, whether my regrets in life would as well. I wondered if the loneliness I experienced at my own hand would eventually get to me. I felt tears well up within my eyes as I struggled to find a reason behind any of this. I hadn't a clue why and I may never have a clue. The afterlife is supposed to be eternal bliss. The sweet release of death was supposed to help liberate us from the problems of life but they seem to follow us into death.

Perhaps it is a blessing, or perhaps it is a curse. Would I be able to feel happy if such feelings and issues didn't follow us? This truth will forever elude me most likely, but it is something I feel the need to ponder. Yes, it is quite ironic that I do perhaps even more thinking here than I do in life. However, over time I have come to believe that our motivations and intentions behind our actions determine their effect and morality. I myself am a good example of this.

The computer provided to me allowed me to write down notes such as these for further contemplation in the future, as well as reflect on ideas in the past. The Halloween night I described earlier happened about two years ago. After that night, I found myself trapped within my own house until the following Halloween. Luckily enough for me, time seemed to progress faster than it normally would until that day. The house seemed to be pretty devoid of activity until that Halloween though, so I myself had to find entertainment in other activities such as, well, writing.

I wrote about my experiences within the computer, this being one such story, and it keeps me sane. I suppose that's another reason why I was presented this hunk of junk replica of my past life laptop. It's a good way to be active and kept up to date while in the very confined world I live in.

The nightmares I had kept on coming. I'd say they occurred about once every week or two. Some of them were harsh, such as the one where I had to live through my murder again. Others weren't nearly as bad but still caused me to feel sick to my stomach, such as witnessing several life-changing moments in which I pushed family away. Such dreams confirmed my theory about certain moments in my life full with negative connotations coming back to haunt me.

I was convinced for some time that the nightmares I had were, in part, punishment for my actions in life as a cruel and negligent man. However, nothing else in the afterworld really seemed to back up this idea, so it is just another theory of mine for now. There are still many questions I have that I am unsure how to answer, so I may seem uncertain a lot of times. In truth, life after death doesn't truly answer our questions about the universe. I've no clue if this experience happening to me is similar to other spirits. Thus, with no comparison to offer, I cannot offer with certainty that events such as this will be similar to others.

When last year's Halloween arrived, I was filled with hope once more. It was a promising day, and I would pray that someone would dare enter my home. Again I saw the kids in their plastic masks and neat costumes skip down the road for a night of trick-or-treating. Just like every year before, they would go up to a neighborhood house, knock on the door, and joyfully accept their delicious treats. The night went on, the kids got their candy, and they all avoided my house once again.

A frown formed on my face as I lost hope, realizing that it would be another boring Halloween for me. I hung my head low and made my way over to my spot on the floor, lazily sitting with my legs spread out haphazardly. I leaned my head against the wall and listened to the sounds of the children's fun dissipate. The moon had risen once more, and the children made their way back to their homes.

Breathing out slowly, I prepared to fall asleep once more. Well, until I heard a strange noise outside the house. I opened my eyes and shifted my head toward the back door where the sound originated. I saw several shadows moving around outside the window, soft murmurs accompanying the motion.

I sat up, my interest peaked. Could it be what I thought it was? Could it be what I had been hoping for all those years? I got my answer in the form of the window near the back door sliding open and a small boy stealthily making his way into the house. He couldn't have been more than 15 years old.

Before we get started, allow me to introduce myself. My earthly name was Marcus Wade. I’m not entirely sure what the purpose of sharing my personal accounts with you is, but maybe I do it just because I can. You can make your own assumptions as you go, but I’d rather not go on a tangent for too long before the story. So, allow me to tell you about my experiences in the afterlife. I think they may interest you. Maybe things will change in the future, and if they do, I will continue to describe such experiences to you. For now, I present you with what I know and have seen as of now. Events which shaped my life after death and continue to do so.

I awoke, yet I did not remember falling asleep. Perhaps that is death, if you can even call the process in which I experienced death. Can something which never was truly alive be deceased? I ask that as a man without a family or a legacy to call my own. All I saw around me was nothingness. I say nothingness because there exists no language within the mortal world to describe where I found myself, and that was when I realized my worth.

I learned that I only ever amounted to all of which those who lived and died before me discovered, and my progression of thought and discovery would come to a halt once I discovered true omniscience. Yet, true omniscience was a fallacy. A myth created so the foolish people such as I would find themselves on a wild goose chase to self-proclaimed superiority rather than become progressive members of society. Sound pretentious? That’s because that was who I was as a man. So there I sat, unmissed by anyone, and totally unfazed by the fact that I was in the afterlife.

A state of clarity had washed over me once I found myself in this strange place. It was as if all my foolish were exposed and I was enlightened to the truth and the difference between right and wrong. Throughout my life, I was completely obsessed with learning as much as I could, so I could prove to those who doubted me I was better than they had assumed I was.

Now that I was dead, I could only be surrounded by thoughts and memories as my mind expanded further and I came to understand what I hadn't before. Fitting wasn’t it? As a man whose sole purpose was discovery and intelligence, this newfound knowledge could only be described as a euphoric feeling to me. Heavenly, if you will. Yes, this was Heaven. It had to be, for what else could possibly be concluded based on the information at hand?

I found myself uncomfortable at first. The sensation of being a sentient, yet disembodied was strange due to the amount of time I had previously spent as a living, breathing person, but I soon got used to my circumstances. I had all the time in the world to think, and so that is exactly what I did. I sat there for as long as I can remember, pondering over past events and actions. Some of them I took great pride in, whilst I kicked myself over my own stupidity when recalling others.

It felt like an eternity before I saw it. Some sort of bright light penetrated my vision, and I was finally able to see the world around me. A perfectly rectangular room, devoid of any furniture, was what I saw. I looked down and saw a hand. It was my own... I had seemingly regained my mortal body once more. The walls and floor of the room were in pristine condition, and everything appeared in a white coating of paint. In the center of the room sat a single white desk, where a large desktop computer sat mounted on top of it.

I slowly made my way over to the old-fashioned equipment and sat in the chair, pushing the power button to the computer. I heard the soft humming of the machinery as the screen faintly lit up, revealing a blue background screen and a single application in the center. I moved the mouse until the pointer hovered over the app, my curiosity at its peak. Then, I clicked twice and watched as a brand new page popped up in front of me, filling the screen entirely.

I watched as a plethora of dates and times appeared before my eyes, each accompanied by a video file. Unsure of what any of this meant, I clicked on the very first link. Upon doing so, a downloadable file appeared, which I opened. Much to my surprise, the download automatically started playing the video within it. I saw a woman in a hospital bed. The expression on her face was that of pain, and I heard her crying in agony as various doctors and nurses did their best to comfort her.

The woman was someone who I had recognized. She was... she was my own mother. After several minutes of her exasperated wailing, one of the doctors lifted up a small child, showing my mother as pride and joy filled her eyes. As soon as the video ended, the download file closed out and I was returned back to the original web page. For a minute, I was left speechless. Upon looking at the file more closely, I recognized the date on it as my birthday. Before me was every single important event in my life.

I took the time to watch a few of these videos, of course. Several birthdays of mine, my first girlfriend, my first few cars and homes. There were hundreds, if not thousands of videos detailing some of the best times of my life. I sat in awe as I watched the early days of my childhood replaying right in front of me. It was truly one of the most fascinating moments I had ever experienced. This fascination, however, was short-lived. Soon, I felt a new, much less pleasant feeling. One of disappointment and regret. I am referring to the events which took place in my life after my childhood.

Now, I had been aware of the poor decisions I had made in life before I found the mysterious computer room. In fact, it was some of those very memories in which I had pondered in my previous state. However, there is a large difference between recalling something and actually witnessing it again with your own eyes. For instance, when I had remembered my various arguments with my parents, the kids and teachers at school mocking me for my low intelligence and work ethic, the feelings associated with such events didn't shake me up as much as viewing my bullies and relatives berate me with insults, believing I would end up as a nobody or some hooligan on the streets.

Even more disheartening was that there were more download links involving the negative aspects of my life than there were positive ones. It is a sad fact of life that adulthood lasts far longer than childhood, and my adult years grew even more depressing as the slow, definite march of time continued. Still, there was nothing I could do within my afterlife except watch as my pathetic life devolved from the innocence of a child to the contempt of a grumpy man, so I continued.

When those closest to me had doubted my ability to progress at the rate of the other children, I personally took it upon myself to prove them wrong. As a young boy with very few friends or hobbies, such a task became my passion, and I spent nearly all my time with my nose stuck in any book I could get my hands on.

I completely ignored any other entertaining activity a boy my age would gladly partake in, even opting to study on my birthday and other fun events in my life. Thus, as my high school years started, I isolated myself from all distractions in order to prove myself capable of outsmarting anyone who dared doubt me. As you can imagine from someone like me, I considered people distractions as well, causing many relationships with the few friends and family I had to shatter completely. These were the years that marked the beginning of my downfall.

After reviewing my teenage years, I decided to move on. I clicked on the scrollbar and dragged it downwards, waiting a bit before stopping once more and selecting a new date. I was an adult at that point in time, and my studying and hard work had paid off. Well, paid off as far as financial security was involved. Despite being socially inept and losing most of those I cared for, I carried on with my anti-social tendencies until I found myself in a good college and got into a well-paying job. I had moved up the ranks rather quickly in the workplace, soon becoming a top-ranking supervisor who enjoyed commanding my orderlies around like they were dogs.

I sat in my chair in disbelief as I watched the smug grin on my face while I barked out instructions to colleagues and interns alike. The nerve I had to treat others such a way. Perhaps it was the afterlife and the newfound clarity and sensibility I discovered upon entering it that allowed me to see clearly the problems with my behavior. It also allowed me to see the scowls and rude remarks muttered under the breath of various employees who looked upon me in disgust. I had been blind to such things in my human state, but apparently, I wasn't anymore.

This behavior wasn't just common in the workplace, but outside of it as well. It wasn't long before the neighborhood came to realize my rather distasteful tendencies and steered clear of me altogether, to which I paid them no mind. It was my choice and mine alone to live a life of solitude, and for the longest time, I was known as the mean old man who lived at the end of the block.

I never smiled, nor did I ever laugh. The very few people who saw me outside of my house or outside of work only ever saw me with a scowl permanently sewn to my face. I didn't decorate for Christmas or Halloween. I didn't send or receive gifts or partake in the many activities within the community. If there was precious work to be done or information to be learned, I focused all of my attention on it.

Speaking of Halloween, I found a few video files around that holiday. I decided to watch some of them and found that even though I never had a single frightening prop out on my porch or yard, not one kid within the area would come near my residence. I actually found myself chucking at this fact, figuring their parents must have warned them about the scary old fart who would surely throw a fit should he be disturbed, regardless of the circumstances. My curiosity started withering away as I clicked on the scroll bar and continued downwards. It was at that moment that I realized I had almost reached the bottom of the page, and only a few downloads remained.

They were nothing special really. Just a few videos of me lashing out at some more people who dared commit the heinous crime of trying to socially interact with me. Yeah, I'm surprised I made it into heaven again in this first place. Then again, it was never made apparent where I was. As far as I knew it wasn't heaven, but just some random phase of the afterlife I found myself in. Regardless, I don't make the rules, nor will I attempt to understand them in a vain attempt to know everything. After all, why make the same mistakes in the afterlife as I did in the mortal world.

Now, the reason why my palms became sweaty upon nearing the end of the timeline is that, as you may have guessed, the final date was the date of my death. You also may have wondered why a spirit is choosing to spend time typing his recounting of life and death online, and the answer to that question is simple. I didn't have a normal life, nor did I have a normal death. I have to share what happened to me with you all simply because I feel obligated to do so. Maybe it can serve as a warning, or perhaps I feel the need to share because some things are simply too insane not to spread. Regardless, I'm already this far, so I might as well continue.

It took me quite some time to muster up the courage to download the final video. Despite mentally preparing myself for what was to come numerous times, I was still hesitant. I found myself out of the chair and pacing the room at one point, taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm myself down. It seemed like hours before I was ready to witness the most important, and most upsetting, day of my life. The day which transferred me from the land of the living to that of the dead.

Summoning each ounce of bravery within me, I clicked the link and watched as the download opened and the video automatically played. I frantically chewed at my fingernails as I watched myself in my living room, sitting comfortably in my recliner chair. I saw the coffee mug in one hand and newspaper in the other as I did what I had always done best, absorbing all the information I could. The night was black as tar and the wind sung its soft tune. I could notice all these details and more as my eyes closely watched.

It felt as if I were experiencing the event in real time, except this time, unlike my human counterpart, I knew what the outcome would be. I knew that that living, breathing person who had been me would live their last day. A life would abruptly end and I would bear witness to my own demise, and it caused my skin to crawl, my entire body trembling. It was an eerie feeling indeed.

This video was longer than the previous ones. While the others had been just thirty seconds to a minute or two at most, this one was several minutes longer in comparison. I watched myself take a quick swig of my coffee and stand up, making my way to the kitchen. This version of me... a person who I had trouble conceiving was the exact person I am.

I.. I knew the noise was coming but I didn't realize it would come so soon in the video. The sound of glass shattering filled the house as the ""alive version of me"" turned quickly and grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter, slowly making his way back into the living room. I practically screamed at the monitor in front of me, begging myself not to do what I was about to. These efforts were fruitless, of course. If I could change the past I wouldn't be in my current predicament, now would I?

I saw myself flick on the light and stare at the broken glass window in confusion. There was nobody in sight, and I had relaxed my body due to a false sense of security. It was foolish, and although my relaxation was just for a split second, it was enough. A large man in a mask pounced from behind the wall, tackling me to the floor.

I covered my eyes, not wanting to see the massacre that was destined to unfold, but morbid curiosity forced tiny creases in between my fingers to allow peepholes. I had to see... I had to see. This computer allowed me a new perspective on what had happened in my life, and I just couldn't help but watch as the man wrapped his arms around my throat, seemingly unbothered by my futile attempts to defend myself.

I leaned back in my chair and felt my body tense up as the man forced his knee into my ribs trying to cease my efforts at escaping, his grip around my throat tight as ever. Finally, after an uncomfortable amount of silence, the man released his hold on me and got up, watching over my limp body. My face was pale and my eyes were bloodshot, an expression of surprise on my face. It was the first time I had seen any emotion besides contempt within me.

I let out a long sigh of relief as the video finally came to an end and the download closed out. I placed my hand on my throat and rubbed gently. It was almost as if I felt choked just by reliving my final moments on Earth. I got up once more, pacing the perimeter of the white room. I felt sick to my stomach at the prospect of the computer. I had access to any moment in my life at the click of a button, including my own murder. I took a seat in criss-cross position at one of the four corners of the room.

It could have been anyone who killed me in all honesty. I had lots of enemies. People who I showed disdain for returned such feelings. People in the workplace, people in the neighborhood. Hell, even what was left of my family at the time had felt deep resentment towards me. Funny enough, despite the heavy torment I faced at their hands in childhood, even when I solved their issues with me of being a stupid kid they didn't seem satisfied. In truth, I don't really regret cutting them off from my life. Sure, I regret leaving some of them. Quite a few of my cousins had always treated me with respect and dignity, however, I feel no pity towards any of the others.

When I went back to the computer and turned the monitor back on, I was immediately met by something curious. There, right next to the first app, stood another. It was a notepad with a title named after me. I looked all around me, looking for any other entities within the room. There was nothing. Not only that, but there were no entry points in the room either. No doors, no windows, and upon further inspection I found no sign of hidden hatches either. There was absolutely no way another person could have gotten in, leading me to believe that the app had appeared all by itself.

Realizing once more that I truly had nothing better to do, I clicked on the notepad and watched as the document opened. Several paragraphs of text sat before me. After reading the document, I realized that unlike the video files, it didn't detail the events which took place while I was alive. Rather, it was an article describing what happened after I died. I felt my eyebrows rise while my eyes scanned the screen, taking in the information presented to me. While I can't remember the exact words I read, I can paraphrase what they said.

In summary, after I died there were several suspects the police rounded up and interrogated. I recognized each of the names listed by the article as people I had come into contact with in life. My experiences with all of them were, needless to say, negative. In all fairness, there were plenty of people who would have the motive to murder me, but not a single one was found guilty. According to the article, all who were questioned were eventually released due to ""insufficient evidence"", although I found that rather hard to believe. Despite not wanting to believe it, a part of me felt as if the case wasn't taken as seriously due to my reputation around the community. Still, none of it mattered now. Not anymore.

When I moved past that part of the article, I found that the topic had shifted from the strange circumstances surrounding my death to the impact on my community. My house had been put on the market, but nobody would buy it. Apparently, nobody would buy a house where someone had been murdered. What had once been a dead zone during the holidays became a neighborhood attraction for some of the younger kids, especially during Halloween. It was at that moment during the reading that I froze, my face completely blank. It had been... years since I died. I placed my head in my hands and took several deep breaths, which did almost nothing to calm my nerves.

Then I continued reading the article, my breathe exasperated, I saw it expanding upon the previous point in the writing. Many teenagers would dare each other on the scariest day of the year, October 31st, to spend the night near my house or, in some cases, sneak in. Apparently, tales of my mean attitude and murder spread like wildfire upon my death, causing tons of ghost stories and rumors to be told around the campfire.

I found several more video files within the notepad, which I didn't even realize could be stored there, but then again, I had learned that I couldn't expect anything ordinary now. I downloaded the links and watched several videos of teens sneaking in and out of the house at Halloween. Some spent the night, while others got too scared to stay and ran home crying. I must admit, the house did look pretty creepy. It was unkempt and probably unsafe to stay in, with cobwebs covering the porch and the paint on the outside peeled and chipped.

The inside of the house, from what I could tell, wasn't in much better condition. It was completely barren of furniture and the floor was coated in a thin layer of dust. There were very few places in the home where light could be found, mostly due to the windows being boarded up. I watched a video of a rather timid-looking kid make his way up the steps to the second story, the stairs creaking every couple of seconds.

He looked all around, taking in his surroundings. He allowed the flashlight in his right hand to illuminate the room. With that, he layed out a sleeping bag on the cold hard floor. There were dozens of kids who had done the same. Eventually, the local authorities took notice and would often have a patrol car near my house during Halloween in order to make sure no kids were trespassing. Once again I was taken back by the amount of time that had passed since my death. Perhaps it had been longer than I thought.

Finally, the kids stopped showing up, and so did the police. I could feel my heart sink a little at that. Something about the fun the kids had, while juvenile, reminded me of the some of the fun I missed out on as a boy, and the fact that their fun was ending somewhat saddened me. I looked at the article and saw it come to an abrupt end, to which I closed the notepad and returned my gaze to the monitor home screen. Rubbing my eyes in fatigue, I felt the incoming sensation of sleep. I found it odd how I could feel sleepy in the afterlife, but I suppose it's pretty tiring to see what I had. I felt myself drifting off, and without much thought, I allowed sleep to embrace me.

I woke up the day after, or at least I think it was the day after. I had no concept of time within that white room, and I was disappointed upon waking up to find that nothing had changed. I was afraid that all the afterlife would provide me was contemplation in the form of this computer in front of me. Stretching my hand forward and gripping the mouse, I shook it a little to wake the monitor up. The background had changed from a purely blue screen to a black and white checkerboard style image.

Once again I looked around the room for any place someone could enter and alter the computer, only to find nothing again. Shifting my attention back to the screen, I noticed one more item that hadn't been there the previous day. It was a folder, and upon opening it I found a page titled ""Instructions"". It was in an application which I was unfamiliar with, but I proceeded in opening it anyways.

Inside was a single link. Figuring there was no harm in clicking one more, I hovered my mouse above it. However, I hesitated. Something about this link seemed odd to me. This wasn't like the others and I knew it, but I had no idea how. Still... there was only one way to find out where it lead. Sighing, I tapped the mouse and opened the link. And once I did so, my vision went black.

For a single moment in time, I thought I had gone blind, and it terrified me. The white room surrounding me was gone and replaced with darkness, and for that split second I wanted to scream, but couldn't. I couldn't do anything really, and it was awful. I would say my heart was pounding against my chest but I couldn't feel my heartbeat, nor was I sure if I had a chest or body at all for that matter.

I couldn't feel my own existence. It was like for a moment I stopped existing within reality, becoming an abstract being. I didn't exist, yet I did. That's as best as I could describe that odd, terrifying sensation. As soon as it started it stopped, and I was snapped back into reality. I stumbled a bit and fell to my knees, gasping for air as I felt beads of sweat running down my face. It was amazing how alive and human I felt even as a spirit. My blurred vision finally came into focus and fixated on the floor beneath me.

The first thing that I noticed was that the floor wasn't white, meaning I wasn't inside the room I had become so familiar with. Instead, the floor was wooden and cold, coated in a thin layer of dust. I stood to my knees and looked around, taking in various features around me. Recognizable features which allowed me to easily identify the place I was in. It was my own house.

It looked the same as it had through the videos I saw while kids searched through it. I saw the same boarded windows, heard the same creaking floorboards... yes, it was mine alright. I was confused as to why I was there, and I felt my heart speed up as I noticed where I was standing. It was the exact same spot as where my murder had taken place.

Feeling uncomfortable with where I was, I moved to the front door and placed my hand on the cold doorknob. I tried turning it but to no avail. The door wouldn't open. I looked down at the lock, only to see that it wasn't turned. I grasped the doorknob and frantically began turning, unable to exit the house. I rushed to the back door and found that the same thing happened.

I pushed up on the windows not boarded and found that no matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't budge. I was trapped inside my own house, with no way to escape. I pounded my fists on the door and screamed at the top of my lungs despite knowing damn well that not a soul in the world could hear me.

My body found itself slumped over in front of the back door, twiddling my thumbs and tapping my foot lightly. I took several deep breaths in an attempt to distract myself from my situation and tried thinking of some sort of solution. Why had what happened, happened? Why view my entire life in rewind and study my legacy after death just to be trapped in the very house I was killed in? It was madness.

I slammed my fist against the floor in a fit of rage and got up once more, clutching my head and violently pulling at strands of my hair. After several minutes spent in frustration, I allowed myself to settle down and explore my now abandoned home. I figured that there was no point in getting too worked up over it anyway.

I made my way up the stairs and down the hallway. Despite the second story being completely enveloped in darkness, I found it quite easy to see and navigate, as if I had my own set of built-in night vision. At the end of the corridor was a door to my room. There was something odd about it, and it wasn't a subtle type of odd either. A fluorescent glow emitted from within the room, shining brightly through the cracks. I made my way towards this glow and, much to my approval, I found I was able to open the door.

Upon entering I realized that glow coming from a computer screen within the room. It was my computer, inexplicably clean and in the same spot it had always been despite the rest of the house being bare. I lifted the computer and realized that a fine layer of dust say underneath where the computer was, which should have been impossible had a solid object truly been on top of it. I had realized that this wasn't my computer, but something provided to me as a tool. It was my very own resource and I found that it came equipped with apps and an internet connection.

I couldn't explain this at all... but something was allowing me to communicate to the outside world. What seemed like a blessing in disguise, however, would turn out to be my only way to share to you this story and what follows. It wouldn't turn out to be a convenient device as a gift, but a way to retell the painful experience that is to follow,

The other thing I noticed about the computer was the date and time. Wondering what time and day it was, I looked, only for my eyes to widen. The date was October 31st.

It was the morning of Halloween, and it was then that I realized my presence within my house was no coincidence. I was meant to be here, on this very night. I remembered my thoughts in the past. If you recall, the kids within the neighborhood would gather around my house at Halloween, each daring each other to enter the old abandoned house where a murder took place years ago. I wondered, however, about the police, until I then recalled their absence recently as the teenagers died down. I then realized that because of the lack of law enforcement specifically in front of my house, there was a possibility that they would be back and enter once more.

A smile grew onto my face as I realized that my dismay upon hearing these kids and their mischievous fun would come to an end would now be invalidated. My smile only grew wider at the prospect that perhaps I would be able to help these kids have fun and do their fair share of devious acts, seeing as how I was too foolish and full of myself as a young lad to do so myself, thus losing part of my very childhood. Yes, I understood my purpose. I was to haunt the very house I was killed in. While that idea might have sounded very unsettling to the average man, I was excited to relive a part of my life I missed out on.

I peered out into the brightly lit road and observed the houses in the distance. Many cheap Halloween decorations adorned the neighborhood, and I saw a few young kids board a bright yellow school bus. I had the whole day to prepare for the night to come. I chuckled to myself. They had no idea what they were in for.

As the sun withdrew from the sky and fell below the horizon, I saw dozens of kids running out of their homes, candy bags gripped tightly within their hands. They skipped and galloped down the road with plastic masks portraying witches and ghouls and all sorts of creatures of darkness. To each house in view, they approached with glee and knocked upon the doors. They laughed joyously as candy was emptied into their bags and moved onto the next houses. None of them stopped at mine though.

The evening progressed, and the night grew darker. The moon stood high in the night sky and provided a comforting light in every direction. Many of the younger kids had gone home by that point, and only a few teenagers remained. My heart fell as a thought formed in the back of my mind. What if nobody tried staying the night? What if they were too afraid of police confrontation to take the risk?

I didn't want to believe it. This was my chance to make up for my failure in life and help those currently living. Yet, I wouldn't get that chance, would I? Figuring the night was a failure, I laid down on the floor and placed my arms under my head, resting my eyes. I allowed my body to relax and breathed out deeply . Did you know spirits can dream? I didn't, but I know now. I found myself lucidly dreaming that night, sitting within my old recliner chair. Well, it wasn't me who was sitting. I couldn't quite see who the person was because their face was hidden behind the newspaper they held. I approached them slowly, clearing my throat and tightening my fist. I placed my hand on the top of the paper and pulled it down, attempting to find out who the man was. Then, I jumped back, startled and afraid.

There, sitting in the recliner chair, sat a large man in a mask. He threw down the paper and leaped to his feet, approaching me with surprising speed. I fell backward and hit my head on the wall, and I watched in terror as his hand opened and wrapped around my throat, choking me.

I struggled for air as my face turned blue. My lungs felt as if they were on fire, and I scraped and clawed at the man's arms and face, attempting to sink my nails into his skin and draw bled. Trying to do anything I could to free myself of his grip.

I couldn't. I was too weak to stop my assailant, and I felt myself slipping. I felt the veins bulging from underneath my skin as my eyes became bloodshot. It felt as if they would pop out from the sockets. It felt so real... as if I would die once more. I was reliving my worst moment. Every second of it, I felt. It was all so familiar to me. The furniture around the room within my dream had been knocked over in the struggle, and here I was, death slowly approaching me.

Of that entire ordeal, the most horrifying moment to me was when my entire body went limp, yet I could still see. I could still see, breathe, and feel. I was conscious and aware, trapped inside of a dead body. I was completely and utterly out of control, like a session of sleep paralysis. I watched as the man released me from his grip and stood over me, admiring his work. I witnessed him slip his fingers underneath his mask, pulling upwards. What I saw underneath that black, foreboding mask will forever be ingrained into my mind for eternity.

It was me... it was my face. I saw it clear as day. My skin was pale and slightly blue. The eyes were bloodshot as they had been upon my death, and worms wriggled around through open holes and wounds caused by the process of decay. A mixture of mud and grass filled the thing's mouth, leaving little to no room for the being to speak. I struggled to comprehend what was happening as the figure grabbed a black shovel seemingly out of nowhere.

The monstrosity moved out of sight and I heard the sounds of wooden floorboards being removed. As soon as the thing was done with that task, I heard the sound of dirt being removed from the ground. Within minutes the creature was done with its job and lifted me with superhuman strength, tossing me into the hole it had just made.

My screams were muffled by my inability to open my mouth as the thing shoveled the dirt on top of me. As the earth filled my makeshift tomb, my sight was lost. The last thing I heard was the faint laughter coming from the creature that had reenacted my murder. A creature that appeared to be me, but wasn't...It was jeering me.

I sat up abruptly, drenched in my own sweat and tears. I shifted into a fetal position, rocking back and forth while a million thoughts rushed through my mind. What the hell just happened? Did I really see what I thought I had? There was no way in hell it was real... any of it! I shivered and shook and I just couldn't sit still and nothing made sense. That nightmare had shaken me to my core and I wiped my forehead. I hadn't felt that type of fear since the date of my death. I thought there would be nothing to fear after death, but I was wrong. Maybe nothing can hurt or kill me anymore, but the memories and nightmares which plague me will remain forever.

Not only would my murder dominate my dreams completely, but I wondered, and feared, whether my regrets in life would as well. I wondered if the loneliness I experienced at my own hand would eventually get to me. I felt tears well up within my eyes as I struggled to find a reason behind any of this. I hadn't a clue why and I may never have a clue. The afterlife is supposed to be eternal bliss. The sweet release of death was supposed to help liberate us from the problems of life but they seem to follow us into death.

Perhaps it is a blessing, or perhaps it is a curse. Would I be able to feel happy if such feelings and issues didn't follow us? This truth will forever elude me most likely, but it is something I feel the need to ponder. Yes, it is quite ironic that I do perhaps even more thinking here than I do in life. However, over time I have come to believe that our motivations and intentions behind our actions determine their effect and morality. I myself am a good example of this.

The computer provided to me allowed me to write down notes such as these for further contemplation in the future, as well as reflect on ideas in the past. The Halloween night I described earlier happened about two years ago. After that night, I found myself trapped within my own house until the following Halloween. Luckily enough for me, time seemed to progress faster than it normally would until that day. The house seemed to be pretty devoid of activity until that Halloween though, so I myself had to find entertainment in other activities such as, well, writing.

I wrote about my experiences within the computer, this being one such story, and it keeps me sane. I suppose that's another reason why I was presented this hunk of junk replica of my past life laptop. It's a good way to be active and kept up to date while in the very confined world I live in.

The nightmares I had kept on coming. I'd say they occurred about once every week or two. Some of them were harsh, such as the one where I had to live through my murder again. Others weren't nearly as bad but still caused me to feel sick to my stomach, such as witnessing several life-changing moments in which I pushed family away. Such dreams confirmed my theory about certain moments in my life full with negative connotations coming back to haunt me.

I was convinced for some time that the nightmares I had were, in part, punishment for my actions in life as a cruel and negligent man. However, nothing else in the afterworld really seemed to back up this idea, so it is just another theory of mine for now. There are still many questions I have that I am unsure how to answer, so I may seem uncertain a lot of times. In truth, life after death doesn't truly answer our questions about the universe. I've no clue if this experience happening to me is similar to other spirits. Thus, with no comparison to offer, I cannot offer with certainty that events such as this will be similar to others.

When last year's Halloween arrived, I was filled with hope once more. It was a promising day, and I would pray that someone would dare enter my home. Again I saw the kids in their plastic masks and neat costumes skip down the road for a night of trick-or-treating. Just like every year before, they would go up to a neighborhood house, knock on the door, and joyfully accept their delicious treats. The night went on, the kids got their candy, and they all avoided my house once again.

A frown formed on my face as I lost hope, realizing that it would be another boring Halloween for me. I hung my head low and made my way over to my spot on the floor, lazily sitting with my legs spread out haphazardly. I leaned my head against the wall and listened to the sounds of the children's fun dissipate. The moon had risen once more, and the children made their way back to their homes.

Breathing out slowly, I prepared to fall asleep once more. Well, until I heard a strange noise outside the house. I opened my eyes and shifted my head toward the back door where the sound originated. I saw several shadows moving around outside the window, soft murmurs accompanying the motion.

I sat up, my interest peaked. Could it be what I thought it was? Could it be what I had been hoping for all those years? I got my answer in the form of the window near the back door sliding open and a small boy stealthily making his way into the house. He couldn't have been more than 15 years old.

9rzscq,0,2018-10-27,The Afterlife Can Be an Unusual Place (My Halloween Horror Story),Chris183539,halloween,https://www.reddit.com/r/halloween/comments/9rzscq/the_afterlife_can_be_an_unusual_place_my/,"Hello there dearest reader. Before we get started, allow me to introduce myself. My earthly name was Marcus Wade. I’m not entirely sure what the purpose of sharing my personal accounts with you is, but maybe I do it just because I can. You can make your own assumptions as you go, but I’d rather not go on a tangent for too long before the story. So, allow me to tell you about my experiences in the afterlife. I think they may interest you. Maybe things will change in the future, and if they do, I will continue to describe such experiences to you. For now, I present you with what I know and have seen as of now. Events which shaped my life after death and continue to do so.

I awoke, yet I did not remember falling asleep. Perhaps that is death, if you can even call the process in which I experienced death. Can something which never was truly alive be deceased? I ask that as a man without a family or a legacy to call my own. All I saw around me was nothingness. I say nothingness because there exists no language within the mortal world to describe where I found myself, and that was when I realized my worth.

I learned that I only ever amounted to all of which those who lived and died before me discovered, and my progression of thought and discovery would come to a halt once I discovered true omniscience. Yet, true omniscience was a fallacy. A myth created so the foolish people such as I would find themselves on a wild goose chase to self-proclaimed superiority rather than become progressive members of society. Sound pretentious? That’s because that was who I was as a man. So there I sat, unmissed by anyone, and totally unfazed by the fact that I was in the afterlife.

A state of clarity had washed over me once I found myself in this strange place. It was as if all my foolish were exposed and I was enlightened to the truth and the difference between right and wrong. Throughout my life, I was completely obsessed with learning as much as I could, so I could prove to those who doubted me I was better than they had assumed I was.

Now that I was dead, I could only be surrounded by thoughts and memories as my mind expanded further and I came to understand what I hadn't before. Fitting wasn’t it? As a man whose sole purpose was discovery and intelligence, this newfound knowledge could only be described as a euphoric feeling to me. Heavenly, if you will. Yes, this was Heaven. It had to be, for what else could possibly be concluded based on the information at hand?

I found myself uncomfortable at first. The sensation of being a sentient, yet disembodied was strange due to the amount of time I had previously spent as a living, breathing person, but I soon got used to my circumstances. I had all the time in the world to think, and so that is exactly what I did. I sat there for as long as I can remember, pondering over past events and actions. Some of them I took great pride in, whilst I kicked myself over my own stupidity when recalling others.

It felt like an eternity before I saw it. Some sort of bright light penetrated my vision, and I was finally able to see the world around me. A perfectly rectangular room, devoid of any furniture, was what I saw. I looked down and saw a hand. It was my own... I had seemingly regained my mortal body once more. The walls and floor of the room were in pristine condition, and everything appeared in a white coating of paint. In the center of the room sat a single white desk, where a large desktop computer sat mounted on top of it.

I slowly made my way over to the old-fashioned equipment and sat in the chair, pushing the power button to the computer. I heard the soft humming of the machinery as the screen faintly lit up, revealing a blue background screen and a single application in the center. I moved the mouse until the pointer hovered over the app, my curiosity at its peak. Then, I clicked twice and watched as a brand new page popped up in front of me, filling the screen entirely.

I watched as a plethora of dates and times appeared before my eyes, each accompanied by a video file. Unsure of what any of this meant, I clicked on the very first link. Upon doing so, a downloadable file appeared, which I opened. Much to my surprise, the download automatically started playing the video within it. I saw a woman in a hospital bed. The expression on her face was that of pain, and I heard her crying in agony as various doctors and nurses did their best to comfort her.

The woman was someone who I had recognized. She was... she was my own mother. After several minutes of her exasperated wailing, one of the doctors lifted up a small child, showing my mother as pride and joy filled her eyes. As soon as the video ended, the download file closed out and I was returned back to the original web page. For a minute, I was left speechless. Upon looking at the file more closely, I recognized the date on it as my birthday. Before me was every single important event in my life.

I took the time to watch a few of these videos, of course. Several birthdays of mine, my first girlfriend, my first few cars and homes. There were hundreds, if not thousands of videos detailing some of the best times of my life. I sat in awe as I watched the early days of my childhood replaying right in front of me. It was truly one of the most fascinating moments I had ever experienced. This fascination, however, was short-lived. Soon, I felt a new, much less pleasant feeling. One of disappointment and regret. I am referring to the events which took place in my life after my childhood.

Now, I had been aware of the poor decisions I had made in life before I found the mysterious computer room. In fact, it was some of those very memories in which I had pondered in my previous state. However, there is a large difference between recalling something and actually witnessing it again with your own eyes. For instance, when I had remembered my various arguments with my parents, the kids and teachers at school mocking me for my low intelligence and work ethic, the feelings associated with such events didn't shake me up as much as viewing my bullies and relatives berate me with insults, believing I would end up as a nobody or some hooligan on the streets.

Even more disheartening was that there were more download links involving the negative aspects of my life than there were positive ones. It is a sad fact of life that adulthood lasts far longer than childhood, and my adult years grew even more depressing as the slow, definite march of time continued. Still, there was nothing I could do within my afterlife except watch as my pathetic life devolved from the innocence of a child to the contempt of a grumpy man, so I continued.

When those closest to me had doubted my ability to progress at the rate of the other children, I personally took it upon myself to prove them wrong. As a young boy with very few friends or hobbies, such a task became my passion, and I spent nearly all my time with my nose stuck in any book I could get my hands on.

I completely ignored any other entertaining activity a boy my age would gladly partake in, even opting to study on my birthday and other fun events in my life. Thus, as my high school years started, I isolated myself from all distractions in order to prove myself capable of outsmarting anyone who dared doubt me. As you can imagine from someone like me, I considered people distractions as well, causing many relationships with the few friends and family I had to shatter completely. These were the years that marked the beginning of my downfall.

After reviewing my teenage years, I decided to move on. I clicked on the scrollbar and dragged it downwards, waiting a bit before stopping once more and selecting a new date. I was an adult at that point in time, and my studying and hard work had paid off. Well, paid off as far as financial security was involved. Despite being socially inept and losing most of those I cared for, I carried on with my anti-social tendencies until I found myself in a good college and got into a well-paying job. I had moved up the ranks rather quickly in the workplace, soon becoming a top-ranking supervisor who enjoyed commanding my orderlies around like they were dogs.

I sat in my chair in disbelief as I watched the smug grin on my face while I barked out instructions to colleagues and interns alike. The nerve I had to treat others such a way. Perhaps it was the afterlife and the newfound clarity and sensibility I discovered upon entering it that allowed me to see clearly the problems with my behavior. It also allowed me to see the scowls and rude remarks muttered under the breath of various employees who looked upon me in disgust. I had been blind to such things in my human state, but apparently, I wasn't anymore.

This behavior wasn't just common in the workplace, but outside of it as well. It wasn't long before the neighborhood came to realize my rather distasteful tendencies and steered clear of me altogether, to which I paid them no mind. It was my choice and mine alone to live a life of solitude, and for the longest time, I was known as the mean old man who lived at the end of the block.

I never smiled, nor did I ever laugh. The very few people who saw me outside of my house or outside of work only ever saw me with a scowl permanently sewn to my face. I didn't decorate for Christmas or Halloween. I didn't send or receive gifts or partake in the many activities within the community. If there was precious work to be done or information to be learned, I focused all of my attention on it.

Speaking of Halloween, I found a few video files around that holiday. I decided to watch some of them and found that even though I never had a single frightening prop out on my porch or yard, not one kid within the area would come near my residence. I actually found myself chucking at this fact, figuring their parents must have warned them about the scary old fart who would surely throw a fit should he be disturbed, regardless of the circumstances. My curiosity started withering away as I clicked on the scroll bar and continued downwards. It was at that moment that I realized I had almost reached the bottom of the page, and only a few downloads remained.

They were nothing special really. Just a few videos of me lashing out at some more people who dared commit the heinous crime of trying to socially interact with me. Yeah, I'm surprised I made it into heaven again in this first place. Then again, it was never made apparent where I was. As far as I knew it wasn't heaven, but just some random phase of the afterlife I found myself in. Regardless, I don't make the rules, nor will I attempt to understand them in a vain attempt to know everything. After all, why make the same mistakes in the afterlife as I did in the mortal world.

Now, the reason why my palms became sweaty upon nearing the end of the timeline is that, as you may have guessed, the final date was the date of my death. You also may have wondered why a spirit is choosing to spend time typing his recounting of life and death online, and the answer to that question is simple. I didn't have a normal life, nor did I have a normal death. I have to share what happened to me with you all simply because I feel obligated to do so. Maybe it can serve as a warning, or perhaps I feel the need to share because some things are simply too insane not to spread. Regardless, I'm already this far, so I might as well continue.

It took me quite some time to muster up the courage to download the final video. Despite mentally preparing myself for what was to come numerous times, I was still hesitant. I found myself out of the chair and pacing the room at one point, taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm myself down. It seemed like hours before I was ready to witness the most important, and most upsetting, day of my life. The day which transferred me from the land of the living to that of the dead.

Summoning each ounce of bravery within me, I clicked the link and watched as the download opened and the video automatically played. I frantically chewed at my fingernails as I watched myself in my living room, sitting comfortably in my recliner chair. I saw the coffee mug in one hand and newspaper in the other as I did what I had always done best, absorbing all the information I could. The night was black as tar and the wind sung its soft tune. I could notice all these details and more as my eyes closely watched.

It felt as if I were experiencing the event in real time, except this time, unlike my human counterpart, I knew what the outcome would be. I knew that that living, breathing person who had been me would live their last day. A life would abruptly end and I would bear witness to my own demise, and it caused my skin to crawl, my entire body trembling. It was an eerie feeling indeed.

This video was longer than the previous ones. While the others had been just thirty seconds to a minute or two at most, this one was several minutes longer in comparison. I watched myself take a quick swig of my coffee and stand up, making my way to the kitchen. This version of me... a person who I had trouble conceiving was the exact person I am.

I.. I knew the noise was coming but I didn't realize it would come so soon in the video. The sound of glass shattering filled the house as the ""alive version of me"" turned quickly and grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter, slowly making his way back into the living room. I practically screamed at the monitor in front of me, begging myself not to do what I was about to. These efforts were fruitless, of course. If I could change the past I wouldn't be in my current predicament, now would I?

I saw myself flick on the light and stare at the broken glass window in confusion. There was nobody in sight, and I had relaxed my body due to a false sense of security. It was foolish, and although my relaxation was just for a split second, it was enough. A large man in a mask pounced from behind the wall, tackling me to the floor.

I covered my eyes, not wanting to see the massacre that was destined to unfold, but morbid curiosity forced tiny creases in between my fingers to allow peepholes. I had to see... I had to see. This computer allowed me a new perspective on what had happened in my life, and I just couldn't help but watch as the man wrapped his arms around my throat, seemingly unbothered by my futile attempts to defend myself.

I leaned back in my chair and felt my body tense up as the man forced his knee into my ribs trying to cease my efforts at escaping, his grip around my throat tight as ever. Finally, after an uncomfortable amount of silence, the man released his hold on me and got up, watching over my limp body. My face was pale and my eyes were bloodshot, an expression of surprise on my face. It was the first time I had seen any emotion besides contempt within me.

I let out a long sigh of relief as the video finally came to an end and the download closed out. I placed my hand on my throat and rubbed gently. It was almost as if I felt choked just by reliving my final moments on Earth. I got up once more, pacing the perimeter of the white room. I felt sick to my stomach at the prospect of the computer. I had access to any moment in my life at the click of a button, including my own murder. I took a seat in criss-cross position at one of the four corners of the room.

It could have been anyone who killed me in all honesty. I had lots of enemies. People who I showed disdain for returned such feelings. People in the workplace, people in the neighborhood. Hell, even what was left of my family at the time had felt deep resentment towards me. Funny enough, despite the heavy torment I faced at their hands in childhood, even when I solved their issues with me of being a stupid kid they didn't seem satisfied. In truth, I don't really regret cutting them off from my life. Sure, I regret leaving some of them. Quite a few of my cousins had always treated me with respect and dignity, however, I feel no pity towards any of the others.

When I went back to the computer and turned the monitor back on, I was immediately met by something curious. There, right next to the first app, stood another. It was a notepad with a title named after me. I looked all around me, looking for any other entities within the room. There was nothing. Not only that, but there were no entry points in the room either. No doors, no windows, and upon further inspection I found no sign of hidden hatches either. There was absolutely no way another person could have gotten in, leading me to believe that the app had appeared all by itself.

Realizing once more that I truly had nothing better to do, I clicked on the notepad and watched as the document opened. Several paragraphs of text sat before me. After reading the document, I realized that unlike the video files, it didn't detail the events which took place while I was alive. Rather, it was an article describing what happened after I died. I felt my eyebrows rise while my eyes scanned the screen, taking in the information presented to me. While I can't remember the exact words I read, I can paraphrase what they said.

In summary, after I died there were several suspects the police rounded up and interrogated. I recognized each of the names listed by the article as people I had come into contact with in life. My experiences with all of them were, needless to say, negative. In all fairness, there were plenty of people who would have the motive to murder me, but not a single one was found guilty. According to the article, all who were questioned were eventually released due to ""insufficient evidence"", although I found that rather hard to believe. Despite not wanting to believe it, a part of me felt as if the case wasn't taken as seriously due to my reputation around the community. Still, none of it mattered now. Not anymore.

When I moved past that part of the article, I found that the topic had shifted from the strange circumstances surrounding my death to the impact on my community. My house had been put on the market, but nobody would buy it. Apparently, nobody would buy a house where someone had been murdered. What had once been a dead zone during the holidays became a neighborhood attraction for some of the younger kids, especially during Halloween. It was at that moment during the reading that I froze, my face completely blank. It had been... years since I died. I placed my head in my hands and took several deep breaths, which did almost nothing to calm my nerves.

Then I continued reading the article, my breathe exasperated, I saw it expanding upon the previous point in the writing. Many teenagers would dare each other on the scariest day of the year, October 31st, to spend the night near my house or, in some cases, sneak in. Apparently, tales of my mean attitude and murder spread like wildfire upon my death, causing tons of ghost stories and rumors to be told around the campfire.

I found several more video files within the notepad, which I didn't even realize could be stored there, but then again, I had learned that I couldn't expect anything ordinary now. I downloaded the links and watched several videos of teens sneaking in and out of the house at Halloween. Some spent the night, while others got too scared to stay and ran home crying. I must admit, the house did look pretty creepy. It was unkempt and probably unsafe to stay in, with cobwebs covering the porch and the paint on the outside peeled and chipped.

The inside of the house, from what I could tell, wasn't in much better condition. It was completely barren of furniture and the floor was coated in a thin layer of dust. There were very few places in the home where light could be found, mostly due to the windows being boarded up. I watched a video of a rather timid-looking kid make his way up the steps to the second story, the stairs creaking every couple of seconds.

He looked all around, taking in his surroundings. He allowed the flashlight in his right hand to illuminate the room. With that, he layed out a sleeping bag on the cold hard floor. There were dozens of kids who had done the same. Eventually, the local authorities took notice and would often have a patrol car near my house during Halloween in order to make sure no kids were trespassing. Once again I was taken back by the amount of time that had passed since my death. Perhaps it had been longer than I thought.

Finally, the kids stopped showing up, and so did the police. I could feel my heart sink a little at that. Something about the fun the kids had, while juvenile, reminded me of the some of the fun I missed out on as a boy, and the fact that their fun was ending somewhat saddened me. I looked at the article and saw it come to an abrupt end, to which I closed the notepad and returned my gaze to the monitor home screen. Rubbing my eyes in fatigue, I felt the incoming sensation of sleep. I found it odd how I could feel sleepy in the afterlife, but I suppose it's pretty tiring to see what I had. I felt myself drifting off, and without much thought, I allowed sleep to embrace me.

I woke up the day after, or at least I think it was the day after. I had no concept of time within that white room, and I was disappointed upon waking up to find that nothing had changed. I was afraid that all the afterlife would provide me was contemplation in the form of this computer in front of me. Stretching my hand forward and gripping the mouse, I shook it a little to wake the monitor up. The background had changed from a purely blue screen to a black and white checkerboard style image.

Once again I looked around the room for any place someone could enter and alter the computer, only to find nothing again. Shifting my attention back to the screen, I noticed one more item that hadn't been there the previous day. It was a folder, and upon opening it I found a page titled ""Instructions"". It was in an application which I was unfamiliar with, but I proceeded in opening it anyways.

Inside was a single link. Figuring there was no harm in clicking one more, I hovered my mouse above it. However, I hesitated. Something about this link seemed odd to me. This wasn't like the others and I knew it, but I had no idea how. Still... there was only one way to find out where it lead. Sighing, I tapped the mouse and opened the link. And once I did so, my vision went black.

For a single moment in time, I thought I had gone blind, and it terrified me. The white room surrounding me was gone and replaced with darkness, and for that split second I wanted to scream, but couldn't. I couldn't do anything really, and it was awful. I would say my heart was pounding against my chest but I couldn't feel my heartbeat, nor was I sure if I had a chest or body at all for that matter.

I couldn't feel my own existence. It was like for a moment I stopped existing within reality, becoming an abstract being. I didn't exist, yet I did. That's as best as I could describe that odd, terrifying sensation. As soon as it started it stopped, and I was snapped back into reality. I stumbled a bit and fell to my knees, gasping for air as I felt beads of sweat running down my face. It was amazing how alive and human I felt even as a spirit. My blurred vision finally came into focus and fixated on the floor beneath me.

The first thing that I noticed was that the floor wasn't white, meaning I wasn't inside the room I had become so familiar with. Instead, the floor was wooden and cold, coated in a thin layer of dust. I stood to my knees and looked around, taking in various features around me. Recognizable features which allowed me to easily identify the place I was in. It was my own house.

It looked the same as it had through the videos I saw while kids searched through it. I saw the same boarded windows, heard the same creaking floorboards... yes, it was mine alright. I was confused as to why I was there, and I felt my heart speed up as I noticed where I was standing. It was the exact same spot as where my murder had taken place.

Feeling uncomfortable with where I was, I moved to the front door and placed my hand on the cold doorknob. I tried turning it but to no avail. The door wouldn't open. I looked down at the lock, only to see that it wasn't turned. I grasped the doorknob and frantically began turning, unable to exit the house. I rushed to the back door and found that the same thing happened.

I pushed up on the windows not boarded and found that no matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't budge. I was trapped inside my own house, with no way to escape. I pounded my fists on the door and screamed at the top of my lungs despite knowing damn well that not a soul in the world could hear me.

My body found itself slumped over in front of the back door, twiddling my thumbs and tapping my foot lightly. I took several deep breaths in an attempt to distract myself from my situation and tried thinking of some sort of solution. Why had what happened, happened? Why view my entire life in rewind and study my legacy after death just to be trapped in the very house I was killed in? It was madness.

I slammed my fist against the floor in a fit of rage and got up once more, clutching my head and violently pulling at strands of my hair. After several minutes spent in frustration, I allowed myself to settle down and explore my now abandoned home. I figured that there was no point in getting too worked up over it anyway.

I made my way up the stairs and down the hallway. Despite the second story being completely enveloped in darkness, I found it quite easy to see and navigate, as if I had my own set of built-in night vision. At the end of the corridor was a door to my room. There was something odd about it, and it wasn't a subtle type of odd either. A fluorescent glow emitted from within the room, shining brightly through the cracks. I made my way towards this glow and, much to my approval, I found I was able to open the door.

Upon entering I realized that glow coming from a computer screen within the room. It was my computer, inexplicably clean and in the same spot it had always been despite the rest of the house being bare. I lifted the computer and realized that a fine layer of dust say underneath where the computer was, which should have been impossible had a solid object truly been on top of it. I had realized that this wasn't my computer, but something provided to me as a tool. It was my very own resource and I found that it came equipped with apps and an internet connection.

I couldn't explain this at all... but something was allowing me to communicate to the outside world. What seemed like a blessing in disguise, however, would turn out to be my only way to share to you this story and what follows. It wouldn't turn out to be a convenient device as a gift, but a way to retell the painful experience that is to follow,

The other thing I noticed about the computer was the date and time. Wondering what time and day it was, I looked, only for my eyes to widen. The date was October 31st.

It was the morning of Halloween, and it was then that I realized my presence within my house was no coincidence. I was meant to be here, on this very night. I remembered my thoughts in the past. If you recall, the kids within the neighborhood would gather around my house at Halloween, each daring each other to enter the old abandoned house where a murder took place years ago. I wondered, however, about the police, until I then recalled their absence recently as the teenagers died down. I then realized that because of the lack of law enforcement specifically in front of my house, there was a possibility that they would be back and enter once more.

A smile grew onto my face as I realized that my dismay upon hearing these kids and their mischievous fun would come to an end would now be invalidated. My smile only grew wider at the prospect that perhaps I would be able to help these kids have fun and do their fair share of devious acts, seeing as how I was too foolish and full of myself as a young lad to do so myself, thus losing part of my very childhood. Yes, I understood my purpose. I was to haunt the very house I was killed in. While that idea might have sounded very unsettling to the average man, I was excited to relive a part of my life I missed out on.

I peered out into the brightly lit road and observed the houses in the distance. Many cheap Halloween decorations adorned the neighborhood, and I saw a few young kids board a bright yellow school bus. I had the whole day to prepare for the night to come. I chuckled to myself. They had no idea what they were in for.

As the sun withdrew from the sky and fell below the horizon, I saw dozens of kids running out of their homes, candy bags gripped tightly within their hands. They skipped and galloped down the road with plastic masks portraying witches and ghouls and all sorts of creatures of darkness. To each house in view, they approached with glee and knocked upon the doors. They laughed joyously as candy was emptied into their bags and moved onto the next houses. None of them stopped at mine though.

The evening progressed, and the night grew darker. The moon stood high in the night sky and provided a comforting light in every direction. Many of the younger kids had gone home by that point, and only a few teenagers remained. My heart fell as a thought formed in the back of my mind. What if nobody tried staying the night? What if they were too afraid of police confrontation to take the risk?

I didn't want to believe it. This was my chance to make up for my failure in life and help those currently living. Yet, I wouldn't get that chance, would I? Figuring the night was a failure, I laid down on the floor and placed my arms under my head, resting my eyes. I allowed my body to relax and breathed out deeply . Did you know spirits can dream? I didn't, but I know now. I found myself lucidly dreaming that night, sitting within my old recliner chair. Well, it wasn't me who was sitting. I couldn't quite see who the person was because their face was hidden behind the newspaper they held. I approached them slowly, clearing my throat and tightening my fist. I placed my hand on the top of the paper and pulled it down, attempting to find out who the man was. Then, I jumped back, startled and afraid.

There, sitting in the recliner chair, sat a large man in a mask. He threw down the paper and leaped to his feet, approaching me with surprising speed. I fell backward and hit my head on the wall, and I watched in terror as his hand opened and wrapped around my throat, choking me.

I struggled for air as my face turned blue. My lungs felt as if they were on fire, and I scraped and clawed at the man's arms and face, attempting to sink my nails into his skin and draw bled. Trying to do anything I could to free myself of his grip.

I couldn't. I was too weak to stop my assailant, and I felt myself slipping. I felt the veins bulging from underneath my skin as my eyes became bloodshot. It felt as if they would pop out from the sockets. It felt so real... as if I would die once more. I was reliving my worst moment. Every second of it, I felt. It was all so familiar to me. The furniture around the room within my dream had been knocked over in the struggle, and here I was, death slowly approaching me.

Of that entire ordeal, the most horrifying moment to me was when my entire body went limp, yet I could still see. I could still see, breathe, and feel. I was conscious and aware, trapped inside of a dead body. I was completely and utterly out of control, like a session of sleep paralysis. I watched as the man released me from his grip and stood over me, admiring his work. I witnessed him slip his fingers underneath his mask, pulling upwards. What I saw underneath that black, foreboding mask will forever be ingrained into my mind for eternity.

It was me... it was my face. I saw it clear as day. My skin was pale and slightly blue. The eyes were bloodshot as they had been upon my death, and worms wriggled around through open holes and wounds caused by the process of decay. A mixture of mud and grass filled the thing's mouth, leaving little to no room for the being to speak. I struggled to comprehend what was happening as the figure grabbed a black shovel seemingly out of nowhere.

The monstrosity moved out of sight and I heard the sounds of wooden floorboards being removed. As soon as the thing was done with that task, I heard the sound of dirt being removed from the ground. Within minutes the creature was done with its job and lifted me with superhuman strength, tossing me into the hole it had just made.

My screams were muffled by my inability to open my mouth as the thing shoveled the dirt on top of me. As the earth filled my makeshift tomb, my sight was lost. The last thing I heard was the faint laughter coming from the creature that had reenacted my murder. A creature that appeared to be me, but wasn't...It was jeering me.

I sat up abruptly, drenched in my own sweat and tears. I shifted into a fetal position, rocking back and forth while a million thoughts rushed through my mind. What the hell just happened? Did I really see what I thought I had? There was no way in hell it was real... any of it! I shivered and shook and I just couldn't sit still and nothing made sense. That nightmare had shaken me to my core and I wiped my forehead. I hadn't felt that type of fear since the date of my death. I thought there would be nothing to fear after death, but I was wrong. Maybe nothing can hurt or kill me anymore, but the memories and nightmares which plague me will remain forever.

Not only would my murder dominate my dreams completely, but I wondered, and feared, whether my regrets in life would as well. I wondered if the loneliness I experienced at my own hand would eventually get to me. I felt tears well up within my eyes as I struggled to find a reason behind any of this. I hadn't a clue why and I may never have a clue. The afterlife is supposed to be eternal bliss. The sweet release of death was supposed to help liberate us from the problems of life but they seem to follow us into death.

Perhaps it is a blessing, or perhaps it is a curse. Would I be able to feel happy if such feelings and issues didn't follow us? This truth will forever elude me most likely, but it is something I feel the need to ponder. Yes, it is quite ironic that I do perhaps even more thinking here than I do in life. However, over time I have come to believe that our motivations and intentions behind our actions determine their effect and morality. I myself am a good example of this.

The computer provided to me allowed me to write down notes such as these for further contemplation in the future, as well as reflect on ideas in the past. The Halloween night I described earlier happened about two years ago. After that night, I found myself trapped within my own house until the following Halloween. Luckily enough for me, time seemed to progress faster than it normally would until that day. The house seemed to be pretty devoid of activity until that Halloween though, so I myself had to find entertainment in other activities such as, well, writing.

I wrote about my experiences within the computer, this being one such story, and it keeps me sane. I suppose that's another reason why I was presented this hunk of junk replica of my past life laptop. It's a good way to be active and kept up to date while in the very confined world I live in.

The nightmares I had kept on coming. I'd say they occurred about once every week or two. Some of them were harsh, such as the one where I had to live through my murder again. Others weren't nearly as bad but still caused me to feel sick to my stomach, such as witnessing several life-changing moments in which I pushed family away. Such dreams confirmed my theory about certain moments in my life full with negative connotations coming back to haunt me.

I was convinced for some time that the nightmares I had were, in part, punishment for my actions in life as a cruel and negligent man. However, nothing else in the afterworld really seemed to back up this idea, so it is just another theory of mine for now. There are still many questions I have that I am unsure how to answer, so I may seem uncertain a lot of times. In truth, life after death doesn't truly answer our questions about the universe. I've no clue if this experience happening to me is similar to other spirits. Thus, with no comparison to offer, I cannot offer with certainty that events such as this will be similar to others.

When last year's Halloween arrived, I was filled with hope once more. It was a promising day, and I would pray that someone would dare enter my home. Again I saw the kids in their plastic masks and neat costumes skip down the road for a night of trick-or-treating. Just like every year before, they would go up to a neighborhood house, knock on the door, and joyfully accept their delicious treats. The night went on, the kids got their candy, and they all avoided my house once again.

A frown formed on my face as I lost hope, realizing that it would be another boring Halloween for me. I hung my head low and made my way over to my spot on the floor, lazily sitting with my legs spread out haphazardly. I leaned my head against the wall and listened to the sounds of the children's fun dissipate. The moon had risen once more, and the children made their way back to their homes.

Breathing out slowly, I prepared to fall asleep once more. Well, until I heard a strange noise outside the house. I opened my eyes and shifted my head toward the back door where the sound originated. I saw several shadows moving around outside the window, soft murmurs accompanying the motion.

I sat up, my interest peaked. Could it be what I thought it was? Could it be what I had been hoping for all those years? I got my answer in the form of the window near the back door sliding open and a small boy stealthily making his way into the house. He couldn't have been more than 15 years old.

The scene would start with your arrival at a room for a new client, which of course be me. Would love to explore your submission to not only a client you are attracted to, but to your boss that could ruin your job and to a potential sugar daddy if you are worth what the escort company charges. 

I wouldnt know who I was getting until I open the door so it would be a surprise to us both. But if you are willing we can explore my marriage and how you would fit in after our initial night together.

My name is Scott and I'm 42. I'm about 6'5 and 225 pound with reddish brown hair with bits of grey. I'm in pretty good shape and you can tell as you've seen how my clothes cling to my body. I've got a bit of chest hair and hair on my abs along with a thick 8 inch cock.

I have been a nurse for about three years and I have come to believe it is not the right job for me. It’s mentally very exhausting dealing with death and sickness on a ongoing basis 😔. I have always wanted to be an accountant, however, last minute I chose to do nursing. I am currently doing my prep courses for becoming a CPA, I am really enjoying the courses and am doing fairly well. 

I was just wondering if anyone is in the same boat as a CPA student with a non business background, and those who have pursued this route how was it finding a job, internship. Or just any advice would be great ! 

Thank you! 

Also just wanted to add an edit here, this was my first post on reddit and I was a bit nervous that I wouldn’t get responses, however all the responses have been so positive and supportive, so again thanks everyone 😊"

States: Body Fat 15%, Height 6"", Weight: 175; Lifts:3-5 a week, hoping to increase it to daily but because of work it is hard

&amp;#x200B;

Reading: Have read NNMNG, that's about it

&amp;#x200B;

Finanaces: about to graduate next semester, no job promised yet will see in my internship starting in a few weeks; currently work retail, no debt

&amp;#x200B;

Spiritual: I'd say 7/10, I lead bible ministry on campus and with my circle of friends in my community so I am a leader in terms of my social circle; I have prayer and quite time every day, average of 30 minutes to an hour;  I have a handful of scripture memorized, mainly NT

Mission: I know I want to be a leader in some way in the church (a pastor most likely) just not sure how or where at the moment 
&amp;#x200B;

Here's my issue, Girlfriend is going overseas to study abroad for 2 weeks, I heard stories of GF's doing crazy things over there and most end up cheating on their BF's, some of my bro's says it happens, I am a little worried as my gf is 19 (I''m 22) and I'm her first everything, I don't know if she can overcome being tempted in that scenario, she's very outgoing and at times naive and cannot notice if guys are flirting with her, tbh, I fear that she may make a ""mistake"" because she's inexperienced, is this my insecurity speaking? Other then her being really sociable She hasn't done anything that would cause me to not trust her, she's honest and a God fearing women, doesn't party, drink, virgin etc; but will that change if she's in a whole new environment? am I being cynical?  

&amp;#x200B;

What concerns me is that she wants to go on a few study abroad trips at this point in our relationship (one year)...I even turned down going abroad for her (she said we should go together next year when I have enough funds, to be fair my trip was just a leisurely trip, not a study abroad) She did say she understands and that I can go abroad without her after explaining I felt miffed about turning down my chance to go. I just find that a bit strange if you're in a serious relationship you would take all the chances you can to study abroad, in her defense she says its for her studies, for her to learn more in her field ; we have even made plans for engagement (in the upcoming year) (also she was home school for most, not all for  her education)

&amp;#x200B;

My gut feeling is telling me something may happen, but I don't find any evidence of that being a possibility, only weird thing is that she wants to go on these trips and she hasn't really asked me how I feel about her going abroad. (EDIT: she has one time said she thought of ways of me coming along but said that it wouldn't be wise for me financially, she has a point as I don't have enough money to go with her, she's on a scholarship)

Also the fact that most of her classmates that are going are guys, one female acquaintance of her may go but that’s unsure, so 60% she will be the only female (disregarding faculty of course, one female teacher is also going, but I’m talking among fellow peers)

&amp;#x200B;

If I’m overthinking, please slap some sense into me fellow brothers, I’m not usually like this I just feel weird thats all

**TL;DR, Girlfriend wants to go on a few study abroads trips, both lasting 2 weeks, fear that she might succumb to temptation because its her first time in that environment (no accountability), am I worrying for nothing, is this insecurity?**"

Not only do I not come from a high ranked school, but I also did poorly in my first 2 years. Failing and having to retake math courses and getting B/Cs in other courses. My common sense tells me that this enough would make me seem like a ridiculous person to admit into a program. However, the last 2 years, I have been essentially straight A's while working internships during the semesters. I have taken Calc 2 and linear algebra with A's as well. Currently taking calc 3 and should be on track for an A again. I don't have relevant research experience.

Any advice? Criticisms? Anything would be appreciated. Apply to a masters, do well? Try to find relevant research experience, while taking more math courses? "

From the end of 2016 to about mid 2018 I trapped myself inside my apartment when I wasn't doing academic work. 

I didn't socialize, I didn't drive anywhere, and a vast majority of what I did was work and reddit browsing (on an older account).  The only social outlet I found was through connections my brother (a much more successful student who attended the same university with the same major) had. During this period of time I was exceptionally miserable but somehow managed to stay afloat in school. I kept a decent (&gt;3.5) GPA, I survived two internships, and I currently have a few job interviews scheduled. 

I suffered a lot of deep-seated sadness despite doing relatively ok and I never was able to deduce why. I definitely feel like the timeframe of my downward spirals coincides with political events, and I can feel my anxiety getting worse as November gets closer, but I doubt America's political turmoil is the sole reason I feel miserable. It just adds a bitter sprinkling of frustration and hopelessness.

My brother and his roomie graduated just before last summer, and I realized I needed to find another social harbor to live out the remaining semester I have in Uni. So I forced myself to branch out. I started going to the gym, I eat out with acquaintances when I can, and I even became close enough with a person in my hang-out-group to become their S.O. (the second S.O. I've ever had in my life). 

For a period of time I thought I was feeling happier (aside from a few turbulent moments in my current relationship), but I'm currently experiencing a return of the sadness, indifference, and general shit-feelings that dominated the last two years of my life. I had a dream at the end of last week involving a song my parents used to sing before they put me to bed when I was a toddler, and it began a revival of these thoughts and feelings.

I'm not sure how to deal with what I'm currently experiencing and I don't want it to keep progressing into what it used to be. I've tried to do what I can to genuinely feel better and to some degree it works. I feel loved but I don't feel happy. I feel accomplished, but I don't feel like my actions mean anything, and I don't see any purpose to my life. "

I thought over and over about what I wanted to do. First, I thought that anything computer-related didn't sound so bad so I ended up picking Computer Science as a major. Turns out it was too much for me cause of the math requirement. After I passed Calc 1, I decided to just forget about Computer Science and switch to something else. I ended up getting an Associates degree instead and switch to IT as an alternative major.

I'm on my last semester. 3 courses shy of a Bachelors degree and omg, I hate it. Idk if I can stand working in this endeavor any longer because I literally don't know jack shit. I didn't push myself hard enough to learn the things I needed to learn and IT didn't seem as appealing as I'd hoped. My mom is pressuring me to get an internship but I don't think I even can because of my lack of knowledge. My senior design class is like killing me because I'm pushing myself endlessly to do everything when I know so little.

I have a gut feeling that something bad is going to happen to me. I hope it doesn't though. My life is beyond fucked atm because I'm totally clueless as shit on what I want to do with my life. I have no skills - ESPECIALLY social skills. Little to no friends. No connections. My self-esteem is pretty much non-existent. I have a little brother who's doing 1000x better than I am. Making close to 6 figures and living independently while I'm stuck in this rut. 

What hope do I have? After graduation, idk if I'm going to make it because I'm 27 and still clueless af on what to do with my life since I'm stuck with 2 degrees that I don't know much about..."
9s1l6b,0,2018-10-28,My fiance (23m) is angry that I (21f) maxed out my credit card (and other guilt trips about money).,ijustreallyloveshoes,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9s1l6b/my_fiance_23m_is_angry_that_i_21f_maxed_out_my/,"Long backstory:
I took a prestigious internship in California, about 5 states away from my home in the Midwest. I scrounged up the initial $900 fee to attend between myself and a few family members. My fiance wasnt a big fan of me taking this internship, and he thought it was a bad idea. He also was angry that I would be leaving him to pay rent by himself. Now, I was paying rent to him out of generosity. I was only there on weekends to visit from college, and when we picked this apartment it was because we thought he was capable of paying rent on his own because I wasnt really living there. But we talked it out and I left home in January for my internship.

I made it about the first five months running on the high that was working for a well-known entertainment company. However, underlying that was terrible homesickness and depression that had been slowly gathering strength. With the remainder of my $1500 credit line, I bought me a roundtrip plane ticket to visit home in May, because I was really missing my entire family but I was also broke from living in SoCal and being paid minimum wage. I came home to visit and that was really the final nail in the coffin of me deciding that I wanted to quit my internship and come back home.

Within about a month of being back in California, I was on the verge of being suicidal. I reached out to my fiance because I realized that I had no place of my own to live back in the Midwest, but he was getting ready to move into a three bedroom house from our 1 bedroom apartment. He said of course, I could live with him. I told him that I wouldn't be able to pay rent because I also was broke and would have to find a job. He said that's fine because he had a new job lined up that would pay him very well, over double minimum wage. 

My fiance bought a $300 plane ticket so that I could come back home in June. I really do appreciate it so much because I dont know if I would still be alive if he hadn't brought me home. (I'm seriously crying writing this part) A week after I returned, another serious boyfriend of mine (my fiance and I are poly) broke up with me. Then I was really suicidal. My plans for trying to get a job were traded for being put on mental health lockdown and trying to perform basic functions. I was lucky if I took more than 100 steps in a day. I basically went from the bed, to the couch, stared at a TV, and back to bed. June until mid-August is basically a haze. 

On top of that, he confessed to me that he didnt really have a job lined up. He had done interviews, but no one had called him back. So when we arrived into our new 3 bedroom house, neither of us had jobs. By the fourth day, my fiance had found a job as a server at a local restuarant. He wasnt making nearly enough money to support us both.

I really do understand that time had to be extremely stressful for him. He moved houses, was caring for both of us and our animals, we had no money at all, and I know it's difficult to see a loved one how I was then. However, I dont think that I deserve some of the things that he has been saying, mostly regarding money.

Since then, my fiance picked up a different job as a housekeeper at the local hospital working full time. I returned to college two hours away from my hometown, and picked up a part time job. We both are living from paycheck to paycheck, and our funds are completely separate. 

From time to time, he brings up how I am doing financially. Awhile ago, I confided in him that a majority of my paycheck was going to paying off my maxed out credit card that I had purchased my flight on. He was very angry. He said that hearing that made him reconsider if he wants to marry me because of how I handled my finances. He had never said anything like that before and it really brought out the vile side of me. I said that he was a fool for getting into this house that he couldnt pay for, and that he has no reason to judge me when I am graduating with a BA at the end of the semester and he failed all of his classes and racked up thousands in student loans.

I regret saying those things and I apologized for it. He never really apologized for what he said
I think he thinks he was justified in saying them. But the truth is that I've been really trying to work towards financial security for myself, and I feel that he isn't doing the same.

Is he justified in saying that this is an issue that requires reconsideration? Am I wrong in thinking that he shouldn't be taking blows at me or am I just as bad for swiping back at him? We both have been pretty pouty. How do we go back to normal? How can I make it up other than continuing to pay back what I owe?

Tl;dr: I maxed out my credit card to come home from an internship when I was in a bad spot mentally. My fiance found out and said that it makes him reconsider marriage to me. Is he justified in saying that? How can I make it up other than continuing to pay back what I owe?"

1. Level 3 bots are not fun to fight
2. The buffs can lead to situations where, not impossible, require perfect playing and perfect luck to win. 
3. The rewards are trash
4. Level 3 bots are god awful.

I was hoping that when they revealed arcade mode I would have something to do that wasnt PVP to gain steel and XP. I also assumed this meant new bots because level 3 bots are beyond pathetic for a myriad of reasons. I just feel like I have been Ubisofted again with this last second 50 minute side project that some intern worked on.

An easy way I came up with to improve the rewards is that the loot you get is always something you haven't unlocked yet. Their is always that one piece of gear you could never get to drop, now this is a way to earn it. This is just one way to make it worth my time to suffer the bot onslaught.

What are your guys thoughts on Arcade mode?"

My ex girlfriend and I met in our senior year of high school almost two years ago, and we fell in love so quickly. She was my best friend, and we did everything together. I told her I loved her about two months in I think, and it was one of the best moments of my life. We had picked our schools about a month prior to this.



The rest of the summer we spent every second we could together, because we loved each other and neither of our high school friends were as fun as we were. It was so much fun, I wish everyday we could go back to those few months because I was so happy. I had spent the better part of eight years bitterly depressed, and around the same time I was starting to feel better she came along and made me so happy. The whole summer was the most fun I've ever had, but the whole time the spector of the fall loomed over us.



We had long talks about it, and we concluded that what we had was too special to just throw away, and that 20 hours of distance wouldn't stop us from spending our lives together. Everything was already so easy. We both thought it would be hard, but we thought all we needed was love to get us through it. 



I said my goodbyes, and I drove south for what felt like forever. I hate driving and I hated leaving her. I got to college and set up and began my new life. It was really hard, but we called every day for hours. I loved it and I loved seeing her. Eventually I got busy though. I was an athlete at the time and my season started and I spent hours doing that and home work. The hours we called slowly dwindled, and soon we were calling for only a few minutes a day. 



I adjusted to this pretty quickly. Yeah it sucked but at least I got see her. She, as you may have guessed, did not. 



Eventually we started fighting more and more about the dumbest shit, and I hated it so much because we never fought before I left. It was my fault, and she was suffering because of it. She started getting angry, too, and said some things about me not loving her enough and not caring about her etc. It hurt so bad and I didn't know what to do. My school had a big homecoming/Halloweekend thing one day and I spent the morning in areas with bad reception, so I never texted her. When I got back to my room she was very upset, and the hours we talked that day led to our breakup. It was mostly mutual, but more of it was because of me. I thought it was selfish to be with her if she only felt miserable because of it. I hated it then and my God do hate what happened next. Short version cause I know extensive sexy talk is not allowed: I made out with a girl at a party and she got drunk and... Went a little farther with some guy. She called me later that night and we balled for hours (my roommate hated me). Eventually we got back together, but it still nagged at me that I did the selfish thing.



The year went on and we had more fights and more breakups, but never anything to the scale of the first one. Every time it only took hours to get back together. Our schedules didn't really line up and we only got a few breaks together, but they were always fun. In the meantime my mom and I had to move to a city about an hour away from the town my ex and I lived in.



Fast forward to three weeks ago, and we're basically always at a  distance from each other. We both hated it, and the fights never stopped. I still felt awful for being the reason we were apart and the reason she was sad or mean. I never wanted that. Anyway I came back for a quick fall break and she drove to see me. I mentioned on her last night there that I was a fairly strong candidate for a scholarship that would send me abroad to internship for free. Only thing: it was during the summer.



This hurt us both. We always talked about the summer and being together, and here I am again moving even farther away. I feel so guilty and stupid for ever choosing school over love, but I grew up poor and the fact that I even had these opportunities astounded me. I couldn't put my education on hold for anyone. After I told her, we spent hours crying together. Eventually she told me that she didn't think she could handle it, and that the end of Christmas break would be the end of us. I didn't take this well. I really didn't want a knife hanging over my head or an expiration date on the thing that made me the happiest. We decided to just drop it but I never forgot about it as I flew back to school. 



Now it's a year since last Halloween, and we had another fight. I needed help on my Chinese homework and waited for a friend of mine to get home from a Thursday night party pretty late. She wanted to call, as did I, and I said I'd call her after I got help. I finished my assignment and texted her, and she responded that she was sleepy. It was two am at the time so I said I'd call her in the morning if she would like. I did not expect things to go as poorly as they did. 



She was drunk at the time (not happy about that but whatever) and she told me that I didn't love her, and that she was so used to being miserable and disappointed with me that it didn't even faze her anymore. I was so heartbroken. She went to bed without saying I love you or anything and I went to bed miserable, and I thought about all of the times we had fought before this. I hated myself but after talking to a friend of mine I decided I was gonna go through with ending things. Nobody deserves to be in a relationship that makes them feel the way she or I did, and I just wanted to make things better. 



I called her the next day and after a long talk I ended things. We had always talked about being friends if we ever broke up and I thought we could do it. I really hoped I wouldn't have to lose my best friend, and that maybe one day if I was closer we could be together again. I know this is selfish and that I'm terrible but I just wanted to do the right thing and make an adult choice, even if it sucked to make it. The whole time I asked begged her to think of a better option so that we could save this thing that we loved so much. I don't know if it was because she felt angry or sad or stubborn or betrayed, but she just said that if this is what I wanted she'd do it. It hurt me that she didn't fight for us to be together, and I really, really, really didn't want to do it. But I did. She ended the talk by saying she wouldn't repeat last Halloween. I'm so utterly devastated about it that I want to just die and erase the fact that I ever fucked up like this. I really wish it ended there. 



We called a few times after to just talk and try to help each other through things. But she kept saying things I felt were intentionally meant to hurt me. She would send me songs that we used to listen to together, she said she was disappointed and sad and betrayed that the only person she ever trusted or loved broke up with her for no reason (I made explicitly sure to say what I was doing when I was doing it), and she would tell me that I was just gonna abandon her as time went on and I found somebody else to love. She blamed herself for all of it, even though it was all me. 



This may come off as her being a bad person but I really don't intend to have it sound like that. She's the sweetest and kindest person I've ever met, and it's just so hard on her that it kills me. 



I had spent the week preparing my fraternity for our big Halloween party (same frat party that I went to after last Halloween, ""funny"" enough 😢). I got alcohol, decorations, prepped the sober monitors because I'm usually the only one as I'm perpetually sober, trained them to keep an eye out for shitty creepy dudes and how to kick them out if need be, etc. I decided that I put in all this work and that I was gonna go enjoy the night with my brothers and most of the school.



The whole night leading up to the party I thought about her and what she said. I wanted desperately to just call her and tell her I made the wrong choice, but I still thought it was the adult decision to keep away, even though we both hated it. I thought about what she said about last Halloween, and that I was sad and lonely, and that it would basically ensure that I never got back together with her if I did something. I was angry and heartbroken and wanted something to keep my mind off of it, so I danced with people. This turned to more and I'm starting to shake as I type this because Christ I hate this. 



I went home with a girl. Two days after I ended things with the love of my life I went home with a girl. It was fine and it did keep my mind off of everything. I walked her back to her dorm then I started to realize the implications of what I just did. Jesus Christ I fucked up. I had a panic attack on the way back as I thought about how badly I fucked up. I can never have her back now, and I can never erase the feeling that I betrayed her. I never even cheated on her and it feels like I just did something way worse. I just love her so much and I hate that I made this choice and that she wouldn't stop me and that I kept going with it. I hate being an adult, I hate being away from her, I'm starting to hate being alive. She was the only person I talked to about anything and now I have this secret that'll kill us both if I tell her. This has been the worst few days of my life and I just wish I would either wake up or die. I'll never find another person that I'd wanna be with like her. I'll never be with her again. I hate me. 



So you've sat through this and now we're finally at the end and I have so many damn questions. Did I do the right thing ending things? Was that really an adult choice like I keep saying? I don't feel like either of those are yes answers but I guess I just want to know. What do I even do now? I'm worried that if I tell her she'll do something dangerous or dumb, and I feel like I need to shoulder the burden of this awful feeling so that she stays safe. How do I cope with the fact that I destroyed something so beautiful? 



Why is love so hard when it used to be so easy?



Tldr: I ended a long distance relationship with the girl I loved more than anything because I thought it was the right thing to do. Now I've done something that'll basically ensure I never get back together with her, even though I know that's the wrong thing to do. Please help me. I'm so young and I don't think I'm capable of handling this.

What is TangleChain? Its a blockchain on top of iota, written in C#

[Last Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/9aetmu/tanglechain_a_blockchain_on_top_of_iota_update/?st=jnsyae3e&amp;sh=1febfab9)  
[Github](https://github.com/AskMeAgain/TangleChain-System)

So ~40 Minutes before this post i successfully launched and tested the first smartcontract! The smartcontract is really basic: it receives coins and forwards 1 coin to a specified address, but basically there are no restrictions if you want to build something more complex (except the smartcontract language only supports like 5 Operations at the time hehe).

If you are interested in the transactions:  

[This transaction forwarded 1 coin to ""ThisAddressShouldHaveBalance1""](https://thetangle.org/transaction/BEIVSRMFJGHNNSMNCUAYUIFLPKPIHFTBAFKGYOSINJTHIUEWQZOYEWWBY9IMPUN9QBWZQL9OMJCHA9999)

[Here is the smartcontract](https://thetangle.org/transaction/AQDPDNBZPUPUGSU9ABMVNUCIWSFEZMNDIBQATNJULFZZDSPAYJLDVEIQDSOEWFA9FIUTHDNMYZBZZ9999)

I just wanted to give you guys an update to tell you iam still working on this fun project and its moving forward. Iam still refactoring alot because in the start of the project i didnt really know where it would go. So iam moving slowly forward. Also Iam doing an internship right now so i have only time on the weekends to work on it.

There is still lots of stuff planned: Interoperability between coins, different consensus algorithm, a programming language for the smartcontracts, a development environment for smartcontracts, some stuff in combination with docker.

Funfacts: 

- Currently 2246 Transactions were made to the tanglechain just by me since the start of the project.
- The project has around 1800 LoC"

&amp;#x200B;

things with my ldr boyfriend haven't been the best i guess?

&amp;#x200B;

we have been together for like a year and 10 months or so, and i thought we were in a decently good spot. we met back in june for the first time. he spent a week here. went great and my family loves him. about a month after, he spent another week here for my birthday, then we flew back to his house for a week. i loved his family and they me. he moved into school and is just beginning college this year. i am a junior in my university. back earlier this month, first weekend in november, he flew back here for the weekend. we went on an amazing day trip. i spent $150 on him on this trip for an early birthday gift for him. he spent $600 on the plane tix. seems great right?

&amp;#x200B;

i am going in two weekends from now. i paid $400 for tix. his actual birthday is then, so i am going to spend it with him and his family. we have plans to spend most of christmas break together. some him here, some me there. we are 1,323 miles apart. not the worst, not the best.

&amp;#x200B;

we always had tentative plans of him moving here this summer. he will work, and i am getting an engineering internship, so i will help him pay for his place of course, and then we will be together. i can't really move right now, because i have some pretty good \~$20 an hour jobs set up, which i thought would be great to help him with rent. he suggested this btw. then, we will see each other on weekends until the next summer, when i graduate and will move down with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

well, to give you perspective, in the beginning of our relationship, before we met, i was a mess. i was recovering from a relationship that fucked me up, and some depression/ocd stuff, and he helped me EVERY step of the way. never complained. i gave him a hard time ALL the time. we went through some stuff with his ex girlfriend resurfacing. my ex boyfriend resurfaced as well. we dealt with it. its all in the past now. we have genuinely been through EVERYTHING. i was probably a really shitty girlfriend in the beginning, but he did his FAIR share of shitty stuff since. so we are kinda even. it made us stronger, and who we are today. but i need to stress how much i am different now. in a good way. i am patient, don't yell, don't freak out easily. i feel like i am a normal person. and he notices and says how much he appreciates this.

&amp;#x200B;

but recently, i don't really know what to do. when he first started school, we had some problems with him saying he needs time to himself. he needs time for games, time for friends, that sorta thing. it was hard to come to terms with, but i realize it is important for him so i said okay.

&amp;#x200B;

it didn't really happen too much, but he said he was happy. we had such a lovely time earlier this month. he cried to me saying how happy he genuinely was. he didn't want to fight or argue on the phone anymore. i agreed. this didn't happen. his school started taking a toll. he started sleeping through his classes a lot. i said hey i will help you. i help him with everything. i love to. i know how hard college is, so i literally don't hesitate to help. but he yelled and said well you aren't here. that hurt because i can literally not change that. i can only help in ways he will let me. 

&amp;#x200B;

last weekend, he ignored me a full day. it was the first day in our relationship we didn't speak. in almost two years. it was hard and hurt me a lot. the next day, we talked for 20 minutes before he hung up and turned off his phone and then ignored me another day to play video games all day. then, the next day i spoke to him in the morning very very briefly and kept things cheery. then, i went to class in the late afternoon and heard nothing until the next morning. he fell aslee for over 15 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

i called him at 8 am before my day at school and spoke to him. told him a tiny bit how i felt. he said he knew it was shitty. last week went okay. i agreed not to have a discussion about last weekend if it didn't happen again. he keeps promising not to sleep 14+ hours a day so i can actually talk to and see him, but it never happens. i went through the week hiding my emotions, but we seemed better. then, friday we really didn't speak because we were both very busy. at night, we had a misunderstanding, and he fell asleep until yesterday again till 3 pm. he felt bad and expressed this. i lightly began talking about last weekend, how i wished he didn't sleep all the time, how i missed him, how i wanted to talk to him. he said i had to realize he is 1000 miles away and can't always be around. i said i hated being ignored and he insisted he didn't ignore me. i said i felt shafted, like i always get his shit and have to put up with it.

&amp;#x200B;

he hung up on me and blocked my number. still blocked now. almost a full day later. i am so hurt and upset. i don't know what to do anymore."
9s3v6a,20,2018-10-28,Supervisor Appreciation Thread,Herbi_MSc,academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/9s3v6a/supervisor_appreciation_thread/,"Hi r/academia, I created a new username for this post, because my regular account has a bit too much detailed information and could probably be linked to me very easily. Sorry in advance, this is probably going to be long. 

I would just like to take a minute to appreciate my supervisor. Maybe it's valuable to some of you, maybe you will just see it as bragging and move on, that's fine. 

So, I met my current supervisor three years ago when I was starting my Master's. I had recently changed from one subfield of Computer Science to another, which I could not do my undergrad in because it was not offered. My supervisor had just come to my university, taking over a center and the chair that came with it. At that state, the center was an organizational mess and on the verge of being closed. It had existed for about five years at that time, people had stayed there for a few months or maybe a year, seen the chaos and then mostly noped out. So, the expectations towards her were super high. Had she also thrown in the towel, I am convinced the university would have closed the center by now. A few people (well, mostly one), are more or less openly hostile against her. This person walks around on conferences or meetings, telling everyone who doesn't want to hear it that he had deserved the chair and how she only got it because she is a woman. I spent a dreadful year being this guy's RA (it made me physically sick - I think I even posted about it here and people were recommending me to take the data and leave). He did not fail to try to drag me into this. I can honestly say I and most of the people in our field are so so so happy that she got the chair and not him. 

However, she did not give up. Steadily, she is building the institute up again. In contrast to the chairs before her, she is not making any helter-skelter decisions, but carefully considers which steps to take next. 

What I specifically like about her, is that she does not care as much about ""prestigious"" advancement as about building a solid organizational and scientific foundation. It's less about ""Look what the people at X are doing"" than it's about being able to work together in a good and healthy environment. 

She is also super supportive towards her students. I have to admit that we are a rather small lab, so she does not have 30 Master students and 15 PhDs. Still, between being head of the center, teaching, tons of committee responsibilites, and all the paperwork, she makes so much time for us.  

She has supported me and my ideas in so many ways: 

* The Master thesis I am working on was 100% my own idea. When I presented it to her, she was so open and interested. I know I am not really doing research on anything super ""in"" or ""prestigious"". My topic is basically building on something people researched 8-10 years ago. When I will present it on a conference, people will probably think I am beating a dead horse. However, she knows it's something that a) I am good in and b) I am passionate about. So she still sends me out to workshops and conferences, where I can talk about what I am doing. Even though it might be contra-productive for the prestige of the center as a whole. She was even suggesting that I could extend it into my PhD topic which made me so happy.   
* I wanted to organize a student's conference (which we successfully hosted twice now!), which she 100% supported. I tried to organize as much as I could myself, but of course she had to dedicate time and energy.
* I had the idea of founding a regular's table. That might only be a small thing, but she was still supportive (""Of course, great idea. We can announce it on the home page!"")
* When I wanted to go abroad, she helped me so much by writing recommendation letters, being in contact with my supervisor and professors in the other country, being available on the phone during that year. She even said I could maybe go abroad during my PhD again to collect some data. That's time I cannot support her with teaching or anything else. 
* She offered we could apply for a grant for the topic I am most interested in and none of the other post-grads are working on. Something that will cost her so much time and effort. Also, all the preliminary work we will have to do for the application to have a chance. 
* She just told me she got approached by a student from abroad who wants to do a scientific internship with us. She said she usually declines because she does not really have the time to look after interns. But she said she replied and offered him to come support me with my PhD research. I was stunned when I read the email. The only thing I could reply was that I was happy to 100% supervise him. 
* She will make sure that if her students are interested, she gets them an RA/TA position. That doesn't apply to me, as I am working part-time somewhere else. But she has offered me as well. 

I am sorry this got so long. I just had to get it off my chest, and I don't think she would like it so much if I told her in person. She is really humble. My way of paying back her support is to try and cause her as little work as possible, which doesn't always work. Oh, and I brought her a bottle of wine from abroad but idk if she even likes wine.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also, not a native, so excuse me if my wording seems off to you. Thanks.  "

I am 25, a virgin who has never had a girlfriend, never had a stable job that lasted more than 6 month and I have cut off a lot of old friends from my life. My mom has a gambling addiction and depression, and my dad who works is getting old and he can't look after all of us like he once used to. I got bullied as a kid, and I thought it would end after I graduated high school, but I have been getting shit from co-workers everywhere I have gone and I don't know how to stand up for myself, I just get so upset and I end up quitting the jobs from the stressful and negative environment. I am in college, and I recently got an internship with a company I like working for, but I'm on the verge of collapsing because I just can't deal with conflict in the workplace. I'm starting to hate people and not trust anyone around me. 

My weight has fluctuated up and down, and I am currently the heaviest I've ever been, and it's driving me to the point of insecurity everyday. I try new diets here and there and work out, but I just end up not sticking to the regime and fuck everything up. I hate myself for it. I also have a very small circle of friends, because I realized the people I stuck up for did not care about me, nobody sends me a happy birthday, sticks up for me when I am in a conflict, has my back in any situation, I am really out here defending for myself in all opportunities. and I am the fool for having the big heart and treating everyone like a damn brother. 

I wish I had a girlfriend, and maybe its my fault for being a 'nice guy' douchebag with high expectations or having no confidence, but I have never done well in the dating area. It sucks, I hear about my friends having sex or seeing the girl I like with another guy and it kills me inside, it feels shitty being the only person not getting that. I don't hate or blame anyone, I hate the cards I was dealt with.

The only thing I live for now are my siblings and my parents, and I want to at least make sure I can put my parents in a comfortable home they can retire in. I don't know how I'm going to make steady income, and I don't know how I'm going to survive the harsh climate of the real world. I've been telling myself it will get better, but I have been coming across the same reoccurring problems, and to be honest, I am not sure if things will ever change.

I have a lot that I am getting off my chest. I hope someone will have a solution or some day it will make sense, but if not, at least I could get this off my chest and going back to trying to get my shit together.

sorry for the rant.

You took 4 years from my life. Now I'm trying to navigate in a world where everyone is either married or in a relationship. What do you care you're in your prime at 23 ...

You lied to me for 4 years about wanting to move out with me. Every time we set a date you would back off. you never told me you werent ready. you just lied! I got us a studio apartment earlier this year , you said you'll pay a small amount and be with me and you lied about having the money.

You lied. I broke up with you , I tries to excuse it again because of your age and rather then want to work it out, you freaking told me you need to be alone and single for now and dont want to be with anyone. You said you need to focus on this new degree and work and your internship. 

What.  

You just dont want to be with ME. Liar.  There is literally no reason why I cant be in your life right now except you dont want me. You lied to me and I'm the one in deep deep depression two months later.  I have to freaking wear belts because I've lost so much damn weight and xant even sleep in my apartment because I just lay in bed being and and having panic attacks  . 26 is a weird age. Everyone tells me to fill my life with hobbies but it's not working. My mind wonders right back to you. I bet you dont even think of me
I apologized to you forever pressuring you and you tell me you dont want to be in a relationship.  You refuse my friendship if it's with the intent of getting back together at a better time. 

I ask you if you intent to date other girls in the future. you never denied it . You just said you dont know. So it isnt about your work. It's about me. Even at post 2 month break up you still cant be honest. Just that you wont close your heart to us if we reconnect in the future.
Seriously,
No. I'm not your backup. Date any girl in between that and dont even bother talking to me because it proves you are using me as a backup plan.

You seemed so happy with me. Claiming it was the best 4 years of your life. Why tf you throw that away you jerk? I cried in your lap telling you I missed you and still loved you. Why tf you meet me if you were going to be so cold

I hate you

I hate you for making me fall madly in love with you , for lying to me saying we will be together forever and that we would be marriedsomeday. I hate you for telling me not get a roommate because you wanted to move in and then not moving in with me and leaving me in this financial mess. I hate you for telling moving on so damn quickly. I hate you so so much"

9s5uel,20,2018-10-28,90 Days Sober!,gruyereparty,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9s5uel/90_days_sober/,"Alcohol has been a huge part of my life since I was probably about 16 (I'm 29 now, 30 in 2 weeks). I was able to control it for a long time, even having breaks where I wouldn't drink for a month. However, it all started going downhill when I was about 25. I started going to bars every weekend, having about 4-5 (extremely strong) drinks and bingeing every time. My job was stressful and I drank to cope with it.

In the past 2 years, I've done the following:

* Blacked out countless times
* Extreme memory loss (scariest part was in the past few months before I quit I was losing my memory after only 3 glasses of wine)
* Horrible hangovers, including vomiting for 12 hours straight
* Got drugged at a party (I was okay)
* Totaled my car
* Embarrassed myself at my sister's wedding
* Cheated on my husband (we're working through it)

And there's more, of course. My story isn't unusual - dealing with past trauma that I never fully dealt with, coupled with the fact that I started graduate school and couldn't handle the stress. I also have a lot of alcoholism in my family.

It was getting to the point where I was buying cans of wine at the liquor store on a Tuesday night and drinking them on the 15 minute drive home in the car. I'd drink 2! Then I'd come home, have a bottle of wine, and wake up hungover and have to go to school.

One of the most embarrassing things was being at my internship over the summer extremely hungover and having to vomit in the bathroom (and then in my car). 

It's be 90 days so far and I can honestly say I do not miss drinking. I love waking up and not feeling sick and being clearheaded. It's amazing.

Thank you everyone!"

I'll try to give as much background as possible.  I've never really had a stable living situation with my parents divorced since I was a little.  In my junior year of high school my mom and sister were constantly at each other's throats and got into fights where I had to call the police and eventually my sister moved out and lived with my aunt.  Shortly thereafter, my mom ran off with a guy and moved to Florida.  I got my own apartment for the end of my junior year and the summer.  I never really got to know my dad besides visiting him on the weekends, but he didn't like me living alone, so he moved to my area so I could finish high school at the school I was at.  I was planning on joining the Army after high school because I didn't have any money for college, but my dad was instrumental in changing my perception of college.  Even more persuading was the girl I met in my senior year (we'll call her B), I didn't want to lose her and she was the main reason I never joined the military (we could've still had a relationship if I joined the military, but I didn't want to be away from her or risk losing her).    


At the beginning of my senior year of high school I was still pretty set on joining the Army, but I met B and hit it off.  We had a lot of classes together and were able to spend tons of time together.  We applied to a lot of the same colleges, but she also applied to a local community college that I did not apply to.  Some of her friends were going to that school and she would've gotten almost a free ride and would've been able to play field hockey (she loved sports and I think being on a team was a big part of her identity).  I got a really good financial aid package to the state university that we both applied to tried to point out the benefits of getting a nursing degree (what she wanted to major in) from the state school which was perceived as ""better"" or more ""prestigious"" in a lot of ways.  B ultimately decided to go to the state school, but in retrospect I think this was a large source of our problems that developed later on.    


More relevant background: my dad owned a house about an hour (we went to high school about 2 hours away from the state school) from the state school so B and I moved in together at that house and commuted to save money.  Except it didn't really help B because she still had to pay for a dorm.  Her mom did not really like me and I don't know why exactly.  It was always very tense when I went over to B's house and eventually her mom told me I wasn't allowed to come over anymore.  B and I largely hid our relationship from her mom and B got a dorm at the state school so her mom would think she lived there, but in reality we were living together at my dad's house and commuting.  I think a large source of her mom's disliking me was the fact that she had B when she was 14 I believe.  She didn't want the same life for her daughter, so she was very protective.  In retrospect I could've done a lot more to gain her trust but there was an incident that really fucked everything up for me and B's mom to have a relationship.  It was the summer between Freshman and Sophomore year of college and B called me saying she wanted to leave her mom and get away because she didn't feel safe.  I got in my car and drove over to her place to pick her up (called my dad to fill him in on the way there).  When I got to B's house it was just her there and she was packing all kinds of stuff to take and wanted to hurry before her mom got back from the store or wherever she was.  I told B we should just take what you've got packed and we can always come back some time for the rest.  She wanted to get all of her stuff in one go for some reason and I didn't want to argue with her.  Unfortunately, her mom came back and she was pissed.  They were yelling and screaming (a lot in Spanish that I couldn't understand) and I intervened when she pushed B.  I tried to cool things off, which they did but B and her mom were still arguing and B's mom was blocking the exit from B's room on the second floor so there was no way for us to get out.  B's mom was essentially kidnapping us because she wouldn't let us leave and both B, her mom, and brother are illegal immigrants so I didn't want to call the police because of the possible repercussions.  So I called my dad and he showed up to try and defuse the situation further.  Thankfully, one of B's family friends showed up and B was able to go home with her for the night (she ended up spending a few weeks living there over the summer until things improved with her mom) and that solved the solution for the night.    


After that I pushed harder for B to move in with me full time and I could support her financially as best I could, but she didn't want to sever ties with her mom (which I understood, my mom actually moved back from Florida and broke up with the guy she was seeing to be close to me and we had a good relationship(forgive and forget right?)).  I wasn't sure how to help B mend her relationship with her mom because she hated me.  There were numerous occasions when she threatened to stop helping pay for B's college if she kept seeing me (no idea how B resolved those situations).  

  
I had a lot of friends in high school, but never really made any in college (partly because of the commuting I think) and I struggled to stay in touch with them since everyone was so spread out.  I had two friends I would play video games with a lot and when B and I were living together (total about 2 years) she always thought I played too much (there were times I did), but video games have always been a coping mechanism for me to deal with all of the shit going on in my life, so I needed that and it was my only connection to my friends (one lived in VA and the other in AZ), so I tried to keep her happy and myself happy.  I made a big mistake here when my friend in VA wanted me to make a Tinder account so he could do the group swipe function.  I didn't really think anything of making it since I knew I wouldn't use it because I was happy with B.  So I made a Tinder account and he did his thing, but I never talked to anyone or met up with anyone or anything like that.  Months passed and I had forgotten about it until I get a call from B.  She was devastated, a friend of hers from our hometown had seen my profile and sent screenshots to B.  I know this hurt her a lot because she thought I was actively cheating on her and I met with her the same day and she said she wanted to break up (totally understandable).  We were both very emotional and I knew she didn't really want to break up, but damage had been done.  The relationship never really recovered from that I think.  (it happened in July/August of 2017 and we broke up April 2018).  We decided to stay together and we moved in again at the start of the school year in Fall 2017, but this time we were in an off campus apartment (I had saved up enough money to afford it and I paid for everything and B still had a dorm to keep up the cover story with her mom).    


There was still a ton of conflict internal conflict with B because she was frustrated with school (she was a bio major because she couldn't get into the state school's nursing program which was more competitive) and I feel she was still frustrated with me because I betrayed her trust.  I think she was really tormented about everything going on with her mom (it felt like a competition between me and her mom, like only one of us could win and that both of us couldn't be in B's life at the same time) and about what I had done.  One weekend or over Thanksgiving break (I forget) I went to visit her at her house and see her ""sister"" Miley (Miley was technically her cousin I believe whose mom had taken very bad care of her (malnutrition etc) so B's mom ""adopted"" Miley(I love working with kids and would paint with Miley or just talk with her when I got to see her and B).   And I was at B's house and her mom came home from work and I thought   
""uh-oh"" so I started to say I didn't mean to be there when she got there, but she surprised B and I both when she hugged me and said she knew if I had stuck around for so long with everything that was going on, we shouldn't be fighting and she knew I wasn't going anywhere. B cried and I was so happy that I could be on good terms with her mom.  


More relevant background: around the same time B's mom hugged me, B's family was going through a lot.  Two of B's uncles died (both in a very similar manner and B's family blamed the aunt who disliked both of them and stood a lot to gain from them dying.  After B's uncle J died his wife (the aunt) wasn't emotional and said she didn't want the two kids they had had together)).  On top of these two deaths, B's best friend's dad committed suicide.  All of this had B in a very dark place and over the winter break we had for college she was suicidal.  I helped her as much as I could and gave her the resources I thought she needed (suicide hotline, as much emotional support I could give) and there was one instance in January where we were texting and she was mad at me and just wanted to be left alone etc, but I had a bad gut feeling and tried calling her and she didn't pickup, I called my dad to ask for advice and he said if I seriously thought she would do something, I should reach out to one of her friends to check on her.  I contacted her other best friend who I knew better J and she got in touch with B who was ok, but B was so angry that I had asked her friend to check up on her.  I didn't tell J ""I think she's suicidal"" or anything like that, I just said ""hey I can't get in touch with B, can you try and call her?""



Everything sorted itself out and B got better, but still not like we used to be when we started dating.  She wouldn't want to leave the apartment, she just wanted to watch Netflix in bed (which we both love doing, but she wouldn't want to go out to eat or anything like that to switch it up).  Eventually she went home for Easter, but it sounded like she had some family problem and couldn't get a ride back to college, I offered to come pick her up but she didn't want me to come get her.  She missed two days of school (as far as I know) and came back to campus on a Wednesday.  She went to class and went to work and we agreed I'd pick her up from work like I usually do, but she wasn't there when I showed up to pick her up and when I texted her she said she started walking to the apartment (which was really weird because it was cold and rainy).  I picked her up on the way to the apartment and I could tell something was up right away.  Once we got home I told her we should talk and try to sort it out, but she said she wanted to break up and I couldn't believe it.  She got all of her stuff and a friend picked her up all in about 20 minutes and it really rocked my world.  I cried pretty much every day and was just very demotivated in every aspect of life (grades dropped a bit, I was just generally super unhappy).    


Whether she knew it or not, but B was always on my mind in our relationship.  Shortly after we broke up I wrote her a letter trying to fix things and she was receptive.  B and I texted a bit after we broke up and talked more about why she broke up with me.  She said there were a lot of times she felt underappreciated and instead of having me there to calm her down, it added to the stress.  And then she said she started seeing someone else.  12 days after we had broken up.  I was hurt because I thought I could turn things around.  Then we stopped texting about 6 weeks after we broke up (which is when she told me she was seeing someone else).  That's when I tried my best to put it all behind me, but I couldn't stop thinking about her.  Every time I got a notification on my phone I was hoping it would be her.  I thought about her constantly and had dreams about her all of the time.  I knew I had to change something because I wasn't sure I could carry on like that.  I was still playing video games with my friend from AZ but had gotten a little distant with friend in VA (I couldn't blame her for Tinder fiasco since that was my fault, but he just got busier with life).  I have always wanted to travel and that was something B and I talked about often (there was a time she was so desperate to escape the problems she was having with her mom that she said we should move abroad and start our own lives).  I asked my friend from AZ if he wanted to do a road trip across the USA with me, and after a bit of convincing he flew up to my place and we hit the road.  We traveled over 9,000 miles and I spent a month away from home.  It was an excellent time and I had tons of fun, but I often wished I was spending it with B instead of my friend from AZ, or that I could text B about something fun I had done.  I tried my best to push those thoughts from my mind and focus on myself and think about what I wanted out of life and things along those lines. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once I got back I decided I had too much free time on my hands and that if I was busier I wouldn't have time to think about B and that it would be a good distraction.  I have tried everything I could think of.  I am a full time student, I worked part time, I volunteered as a tutor, started two small businesses, spent more time at the gym working towards fitness goals, and being busy helped but didn't solve my problem.  At the end of days when I had gone to class and exercised and gone to work, I came home lonely and depressed and I had no time to try and develop friendships or things like that.  I quit my part time job to have more time for me and figure out another solution.  I started to learn guitar and music has helped me, but still hasn't fully resolved it.  I also tried dating someone else but I ended it because it felt cheap and when I was with her I was thinking of B.  


To make it tougher, B and I still go to the same college and I have been seeing her car parked on campus often, which makes me think of her and puts me in a bad mood.  And just recently I saw her with her new boyfriend and it really hurt for some reason.  I haven't interacted or contacted her since May.  I don't know how she's doing or if she's happy or thinks of me as much as I think of her and I just don't know what to do.  Ultimately I want her to be happy, but I also want to be happy.  Devoting all my free time to school and working and volunteering has gotten me some really good internship opportunities but it's like I don't even care about them.  I have just been keeping my head down as best I can and focusing on school and trying to make friends/be more involved on campus with volunteering and clubs, but it hasn't really helped.  I have a pretty good relationship with both of my parents, but they haven't been helpful in this aspect and I don't know what other steps to take.  I don't know what I expect from this, but maybe it will help in some way.    


I have thought about contacting B and letting her know how I feel (which I don't know if it would help me or possibly hurt her) and even then she could just say she's happily seeing someone else (which very well may be true).  We left it on a friendly note and I think we could have still been friends, but I didn't see her like that.  Bottom line is that I don't want to hurt her by bringing up the past, but I also don't want to carry on like this and can't think of other things to change in my life.  Any and all advice would be appreciated (props to anyone who actually reads this)."

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

I am in a bind and need a room to rent for free or severely discounted until I get back on my feet. I also need some advice. I am willing to cook, clean, rake leaves, and other things. I will do whatever it takes until I get my first paycheck. Unfortunately I can't drive uber or lyft because all of my belongings are in my car (trunk and backseat) because I can't afford to have them stored.

**Backstory**: I moved to CT under the promise of a new job at my friend and ex-bf's accounting company (you can read that post in my post history). I thought it was fishy but I had no options back home so I took the leap and drove out here. Unfortunately a few days ago that opportunity went bust. He said he won't be able to hire me right now but I can intern for 10 hrs a week. 10 hrs a week is nothing so I am currently applying for every job I can get and doing phone interviews and in person interviews. I have a few interviews that seem promising next week for admin asst jobs so I hope to god that it happens and I am hired. I want to stay out here because there is nothing for me back in NV. Also, NV is a terrible place for me because I used to have an addiction issue and living there only exacerbated it.

I have a negative balance in my bank account, my gas tank is almost on empty, and I have no place to stay. I am trying to survive currently with $20. I have been sleeping in my car in a 24 hr WalMart parking lot. I pawned my old macbook, Ps4, and some cheap gold bracelets I had but that money is gone because I need it for gas and food. My cell phone will be cut off on November 17th if I don't pay it.

It's getting colder and I was wondering if someone had a room for rent situation I could use for a month until I get a job and get my first paycheck. I want to stay here and make it work. I am currently in the Meriden, CT area but I am willing to stay anywhere.

Please help me. I have nowhere else to turn. I don't know anyone here. Any and all advice and help would be appreciated.

I have 10 yrs of Admin Asst and Office Manager experience and am willing to send my resume if you know of places that are hiring.

I am so lost and in tears typing this. Never thought I would be in this situation but here I am.

I am a student in a grant writing course who has chosen a long time existing nonprofit in the Cleveland area to do a mock proposal for.  I have noticed that an area where they could improve their organization was in their website and social media presence. I was thinking that a co-op with a local university or tech firm to donate services of educating the organization on media cultivation, and/or an intern to come on board to do the maintenance would be a good idea. 

I am having a hard time researching where to find these services. The Foundation Center Website is a good resources but I do not have access to searching well. 

\*\*Does anyone have a similar idea they have found grant funding for or any experience on how to help search

9s6xys,1,2018-10-28,I am so pissed off.,josie_96,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9s6xys/i_am_so_pissed_off/,"I've been pissed off since last night because I spent my entire Saturday studying for a Sunday morning midterm for a class I hate when I would have rather gone out to one of the Halloween parties happening. I was mad because I felt coerced into studying and like my freedom was taken away from me.

On top of that, the exam didn't go super well, so I am also pissed off at myself for not being better prepared. And I'm pissed because instead of kicking back and relaxing for the rest of the day, I need to study for another midterm I have tomorrow, which *ding* *ding* *ding*, I am not ready for either. It's past 5pm and I haven't started yet. There are so many things I want to do but can't because I have to study. My midterms have been so spread out, I haven't been able to catch a break in like a month. Tomorrow will be my last exam, but even then, I have to worry about stupid projects I don't care about.

This is why I hate school. Learning is fucking great, but only when you get to do it on your own terms. When there's an actual purpose to what you're learning. When you *decide* to take a class because *you want to*. Online courses are the future. Soon enough, school as we know it will cease to exist, and students will be able to learn at their own pace.

I'm tired. I keep going to bed too late, I drink 2 RedBulls a day, almost every day. They don't even have any effect on me anymore.

I wanted to study at school after my exam this morning, but thought it would be wise to take a quick nap first, so I decided to come home. Big mistake.

I am moving to Boston for an internship in January and as soon as I get home, my dad starts talking about how I basically won't have any money left after rent, utilities, groceries, etc. As if taking the job was a big mistake and I was too dumb to realize that. And to make matters worse, I find out my mom told her friend how much the internship is going to pay me. I was PISSED. Who does she think she is to share that kind of private information about me?? I barely know her friend, it's none of her business. My parents seem to think it's no big deal. And now they're basically gossiping about how I locked myself up in my room because their lives are so fucking empty and they have nothing better to do.

They had also offered to subsidize my move by paying 50% of the rent, which I was so thankful for, I almost cried. Now they're saying don't need to pay my half anymore since ""I'll have enough money left."" Just when I was starting to think they were decent people. If you're not sure about paying, then don't fucking make the offer. That's like buying a gift to someone and returning it before even giving it to them because ""they don't need it"". What the fuck.

I am in a horrible mood right now. I just want to sleep or watch TV and forget that the world exists, but I still have to fucking study. And I hate this stupid class I have to study for. The exam will apparently have one long essay question, 5 short-answer questions, and 30-something multiple choice questions. And all to be completed in like 1h because the prof wants to carry on with the class after. What the fuck?? It clearly won't be enough time to do everything.

There are so many other things that are upsetting me right now, but I won't talk about it here. I'm so fucking stressed. Life is hard.

And I have no one in my life right now who I can talk to about this and who won't pass judgment and who will actually understand me, so I have to vent to a subreddit instead. My life is a fucking joke."
9s73kx,89,2018-10-28,[Residency] Tips on researching EM programs before your interviews,EM_Insider,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/9s73kx/residency_tips_on_researching_em_programs_before/,"I'm an EM PGY1 resident and thought that with the upcoming interviews (maybe some of you have already gone on some), I would sit down and write about how I approached researching each program so I could arrive prepared and with a reasonable sense of what each program was about. This was originally written as a blog post on my website [EM Insider](https://www.eminsider.com/), which you can check out along with a comprehensive overview of the entire Emergency Medicine residency application process I created in an attempt to help those unsure of what steps they need to take in this critical stage of medical school. But I still wanted to post some of the more time-relevant content here because my main goal is ultimately to help you guys out. I hope that this is indeed helpful for you and if you have any questions, I'm very happy to offer whatever insight I can within the bounds of my own experience and analysis.


---

&amp;nbsp;

The way I went about this problem was an excel sheet, which I'm sure was most people's solution. I'd recommend using a cloud-based interface like google drive because as it turns out, I lost the single copy of my sheet when my computer crashed a few months ago. Fortunately it was long after I had matched, but that doesn't mean it couldn't happen to you.

 
&amp;nbsp;
 

Starting from the basics, you will want to record the basic, quantitative details of each program. These are things like: the ***name of the program*** (duh), ***how many years*** the residency is, ***how many residents*** per class, ***salary***, and ***vacation time***. Also write down the names of the ***Program Chair***, ***Program Director***, and ***Program Coordinator***. The residency's website will be your first go-to source for this information. Most EM programs have a decent website though there are definitely exceptions, and in other cases, you may find that they may have multiple websites - an official subpage on the hospitals website and an additional website hosted and maintained by the residency themselves. One example of this off the top of my head is Downstate, which has an EM residency page on their main .edu website as well as a separate website they created to consolidate more recent and specific information about their program.

&amp;nbsp;

Another useful resource is [EMRA Match](https://webapps.emra.org/utils/spa/match#/search/map),  which consolidated all of these basic details from every EM residency program in the country and allows you to search them individually, or filter based on search criteria. I prefer to still go to the residency website as well because there can be discrepancies in the data and there is additional data that may be useful on your interview day.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, the other important piece of quantitative data you will want to ascertain about each program is their ***shift schedule***. In general, every program will have 8, 10, or 12 hour shifts with anywhere from 18-21 shifts per block. The specific arrangement of shifts will differ and can be a crucial part of how you determine your eventual rank list. I can tell you that I eventually ranked every 12 hour program at the bottom because I just wasn't about that life, whereas other people appreciate having more days off. And then there are programs that do 12 hour shifts and have the most shifts per block, but that's a different topic. The shift schedule is not something that you will necessarily be able to find for every program. Ideally they would list this somewhere on their website or on EMRA Match, but this might not be there. In which case it's fine to leave a ""?"" and move on. With any of these topics, if you aren't able to find the information, don't panic. These are good questions to leave for the pre-interview dinners.

&amp;nbsp;

Then you should move onto the ***clinical rotations*** residents will go through. I usually only went through the intern year because it was too much information and ultimately wasn't that important. Most programs will provide a list of the rotations you will complete in each residency year. You should only indicate the rotations that are different or seem unusual. I can tell you that every residency program will have you go through ED, PED, trauma, ICU, and probably OBGYN and anesthesia. If a program has you do medicine wards, or a psych rotation, that's something different about their schedule and something you should note down. These aren't too important as no one will ask you questions about this, but remember that you are also interviewing for the sake of determining if a program is a good fit for you. If they have what looks like a crappy rotation schedule, it's important to know if the residents themselves feel that the rotations are not helpful.

&amp;nbsp;

It's almost a meme at this point, but spend a little time researching the ***pediatric EM*** exposure. For whatever reason, it's the one detail that program directors always harp on while on podcasts about interview preparation. You will want to know if the program has integrated or dedicated pediatric blocks, in other words, do you have PEM shifts only during a single block at some point in the year, or are your shifts interspersed with adult EM shifts through the year? The latter will provide you will a more comprehensive exposure to pediatric emergencies, particularly given flu season as well as keep your knowledge fresher.

 &amp;nbsp;

Another related topic is how much time is dedicated for both ***research and electives***. For the most part, a four-year program will provide much more time than a three-year for obvious reasons. Unless you are heavily interested in research, then just find out how many weeks you will get and that will be good enough. If research is a strong desire of yours, then you probably know what you are looking for better than I do. As for electives, again just look up how many weeks are offered. This is usually pretty standard but there can be some pretty notable differences, like Maricopa which despite being a three-year program, offers a massive 12 weeks of electives.

&amp;nbsp;

Then find what ***fellowships*** are offered by the program. Realistically the fact that a program has a toxicology fellowship doesn't really affect you as a resident, but they're usually a point of pride for the faculty. It will also give you a good sense of the resources of that program. Particularly if you are interested in pursuing a specific fellowship, you can insinuate parlaying that interest into receiving mentorship from the fellowship directors. Again, I think this is something that you can just look up and write down a list and move on. It's good enough to know that the fellowships exist but you don't need to go into further detail than this.

&amp;nbsp;

After all this basic information gathering, you start to get into the more esoteric and more personal preference categories. If the basic information is what every program will expect you to already know and will be disappointed if you don't, it's the qualitative and obscure information that will make them think you actually are interested in them. If a program does something differently from other programs, there's a reason for it. Sometimes it's because they're lazy and haven't gotten around to updating their curriculum, but usually there's a lot of thought and planning that went into these changes. They will appreciate you trying to discern why they decided to develop their program in a particular direction and it will give you a good sense of their vision.

&amp;nbsp; 

What additional facts you research will be different for each person because the things you care about might not be the things I care about. For example, I didn't research about EMS exposure because that's not something I care about. But I did spent time looking up whether programs dedicated time for annual retreats because I thought I would prefer programs that did this other those that didn't. It's always 

&amp;nbsp; 

I'll just list some off the beaten path topics and hopefully some of them will catch your eye. Not every program will have these, and not every program that has these will list them on your website. Again, these make great questions for the pre-interview dinner. If you can show up to your interviews with information about a topic that greatly interests you and isn't available anywhere except through talking with people in the program, it will give you a huge leg up in showing your interest in the program itself.

&amp;nbsp; 

* EMS exposure
* Wilderness medicine
* Dedicated research blocks/electives
* Global medicine elective opportunities
* Administration rotations

 

* Moonlighting opportunities
* Event medicine (moonlighting opportunities at big events such as sports games, music festivals)
* Annual residency retreats
* Support for travelling to conferences (ACEP, AAEM, etc)
* Organized mentor program
* Notable faculty
* Current residents from your medical school

 

* Food budget
* Subsidized housing
* Additional salary benefits (education stipend, moving stipend, housing support)



---------

 

For the most part, I would try to shy away from putting a lot of effort into researching the local region or city of a program. You certainly should know some things about where the hospital is located, but don't make it an emphasis of your research. If you spend the entire interview praising the culture and variety of the city, it can come across that you are only interested in a program for where it's located, rather than the actual strengths of the residency itself. It won't hurt to bring up that you love surfing, or hiking, or the country music scene as a side note to support why a program is a good fit for you but be wary of leading with this point. The image you want to portray should be your consideration of the program's educational opportunities with location being the cherry on top.

&amp;nbsp;

Don't forget that while your goal is to impress your interviewers and secure a high ranking on their list, you are also interviewing for yourself. In just a few short months, you will have to rank all these programs based on where you want to dedicate spending the next 3-4 years of your life. Just as you are trying to impress upon programs that you are a good fit for them, each residency will try to demonstrate how they may be a good fit for you.

&amp;nbsp;

Conduct your research with the understanding that you are trying to determine where you will be the happiest and where you will best be educated and trained for the purposes of reaching whatever career goals you have. Try to figure out what place will best suit your needs and this preparation will show through in your interviews. Program faculty aren't trying to pimp you and figure out who is the smartest or best at using Google. They want to know who has the most interest in them and who will ultimately be happy and well utilized within the culture and system they have developed. By figuring out where you will best fit, you can show a residency that you belong and are someone they should be excited to train."
9s7gfv,1,2018-10-28,26 [f4a] New intelligence agent proving her worth,chattycathy92,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9s7gfv/26_f4a_new_intelligence_agent_proving_her_worth/,"I had spent years chasing my dream. Ever since I was a little girl, the intelligence community appealed to me as a future career. The intrigue and excitement I had seen in the movies as a child had always captivated me. The real world was not as fun, however. I had just completed what seemed like an endless amount of studies. A double major in macroeconomics and political science (4.0 GPA) and receiving a masters in international business with a thesis on organized crime in the US. (I even defended it in Russian that I had learned on the side.) Internships with law enforcement every summer and a sterling record with each, all my superiors begging to write my recommendations letters when I was ready to apply to the CIA. They knew all about my dream, It's all I would talk about.

I had been called back for the first round of interviews and could hardly sleep. Just because I was incredibly educated didn't mean I didn't know how the world works. A nice pair of ass and tits walking through the door with my resume would never be turned down. This wasn't the time to play it safe. My interview outfit was a pencil skirt that seemed to threaten to rip it was so tight on my ass and ending just halfway down my thighs. Both nicely toned from the years I spent preparing for the physical requirements of the job. When I bought the blouse I wore, I knew exactly when i would wear it. In the most professional tone, it screamed, ""these perky tits are way bigger than my slender frame would suggest.""

I about screamed when I got the call that I had gotten accepted into a field office in Chicago. I showed up 30 minutes early to my first day and my excitement quickly wore off. My dreams of undercover roles and stakeouts were buried under the mountain of paperwork I was to file. They said it took years of this before I'd even be considered for anything more. This was not what I signed up for.

One Tuesday 6 weeks in to the job, as I was taking the senior agents their coffee during a briefing, I heard them discussing a new covert operation. It was dangerous, exciting, and would require a female agent to act as a hussy to a local coke running group for as long as it took to get the information. (Please include the work ""pink"" in your message so I know you read this) They suggested it might be a couple of days of solo work, mostly just hanging around trying to overhear something good. However, the 2 female agents balked at the idea of being involved with one of the most dangerous groups in the country. I didn't even remember speaking up, just the looks I was given after I did, the male officers looking at each other and then back at me (well my body at least) and nodding. ""You've got the job...err...what was your name again?""

""Agent Allison, sir.""
____

So the premise is that I am sent undercover to dig up dirt on a crime lord. The mission should be fairly safe and innocuous, but I don't realize what I have signed myself up for. All I know is I won't come back without the information.

Open to guys or girls playing anything. I think ideally we could start as the senior agents ""prep"" me for my role, then move to the crime lord. I would ask you play both. 

The main kink for this is the idea that I am ""forced"" to do things for my dream job that I don't want to, but have only myself to blame."
9s7mc3,3,2018-10-28,I'm sorry I left you,boopboopdadeboop,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9s7mc3/im_sorry_i_left_you/,"T, 

I'm sorry. I wish I had never mindlessly signed off under your name instead of mine at that internship we did. I wish I hadn't responded to your message asking me more about the research I had been doing. I wish I had never agreed to go on a date with you. I wish we had never formed such an intense bond that summer. 

It would have been easier. You helped me grow and learn more about myself. But then I left you. I was only 20. I wasn't ready for such a commitment. 

That first date we had, you made me laugh and smile more than I knew I could. I knew you were the perfect one for me. You were my first everything. That year I had with you was the most magical. We fought sometimes, yes, but I would always have your arms to hold me under any circumstance. 

But then you asked me something I had considered, but not for now, it was something I imagined happening in the far future. I knew your family was pressuring you.  When you took me to the same coffee shop we had our first date at exactly one year prior, I thought it was a cute gesture. But then you sunk to one knee. I froze. I didn't run. My mind went blank as I turned around and slowly walked out of the coffee shop to my car. I sat there and cried for probably an hour. You didn't follow me. I think you knew I wasn't ready. You had hoped I was. You loved me more than I could ever dream, and I, you. As soon as I drove my car out of that parking lot, it was as if I knew we could never be. I have not spoken to you since. I changed my phone number. I see your unopened emails sitting in my inbox. It's cruel, I know, and I'm sorry. But I wasn't ready, and didn't want to convince myself that I was. It was self-preservation and I know how much it hurt you. 

I was still a student, trying to finish my engineering degree. You had just graduated. You were already set to do a masters degree at the same school. You never did it. You moved across the country. You haven't used your computing science degree that you were so excited about. I heard you were trying to get help for an alcohol addiction you had developed shortly after moving. 

For that, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that I ruined your trajectory. I avoided you after I walked out of that coffee shop because I was scared and immature. I should have had a conversation with you. I don't regret not marrying you. I am glad I had the courage to know that was not something I was ready for. I regret involving myself in your life to begin with. I wish I had never been a part of it because of how much hurt I caused you in the end. I regret that I know you couldn't be angry with me after I left. I regret that you still love me, and that I still love you. 

T, I want you to be happy, but I want you to be happy with someone else. Someone who won't leave when things become hard or confusing. 

I'm sorry.

# Chance To Win Surveys

This is a 'new' section to this post, but I don't really ever plan on putting much here. These are basically online studies that you aren't guaranteed to get anything out of. I'm limiting this section to surveys/studies that only give out &gt;=$500 in compensation and there are at least 10 winners selected. Also the surveys/studies shouldn't be excessive.

Maybe you want me to lactate for you and every day I bring you lunch in you office and then you feed from my tits. Maybe you want me to wear a butt plug so when you come home to the apartment you can fuck me nice and hard before going off to your wife. Maybe you just spend the weeks with me and weekends at home and every day you come home and make sure I've been good for you, and if I haven't you spank me good and hard to remind me. You love that I wear what you like, that I'm so excited to create a world for you where your pleasure is the most important thing. We go shopping together and you approve everything I own.

Maybe you just need to come home and put me over the trendy breakfast bar, and fuck me good and hard. Maybe what you need after a hard day is to order me over the sofa and take it out on my ass with your hand. You love knowing that I'm at the apartment, waiting for you and so willing to do anything for you.

I'm not looking to be humiliated, just be the eager girl you can finally afford to keep to do everything you want to. Your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't mind, knowing I'm a good way to keep you busy while she has her own life. She can do her high jet set life while you have your obedient girl in the city. She acts as your society wife and maybe she's glad not to have to deal with any of your baser desires.

I still won't use my car for classes, opting to bus instead since parking is a joke here. During the school year I'll mostly use it for work(when I have shifts that don't coincide with classes, so like 2 times a week) grocery trips/ going out with friends, and the occasional 70 mile trip home. 

During the summer it'll be the same except I will be commuting to work every day. During the school year my commute is going to be like 2 miles to work, but during the summer it'll likely be a lot more. My budget is anywhere from 5-10k dollars but I'd prefer to keep it under 6-7k, especially since it's my first car.

As to what I like, I definitely want a smaller car, the car I want the most is a Miata, I love the look of it and convertibles in general, but I feel like it would be a bad idea living in Michigan. I hate spending money so I'd rather find something with good mpg, but I don't know if my commute is long enough for it to really matter.

I do really like convertibles but living here I'd only get to use it for like 4 months a year so I know it's not something I should look for. I've got a friend who's extremely into cars who said he'd help with repairs or work I needed done as long as I paid for the parts, so going for an older car like a 90's Corvette might be something I could look into."

9s9jwj,1,2018-10-28,Should I consider quitting my internship?,ta1515155,TooAfraidToAsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/9s9jwj/should_i_consider_quitting_my_internship/,"Hey guys!

I'm asking this here because I don't know where else to turn for advice. Basically... I feel trapped in an impossible internship and I feel really sick about it.

**The Backstory:**

(My manager is ""John."" His boss, the CMO of the company, is ""April."")

I completed a five month-long, full-time marketing internship for this small-ish tech company (~100 employees) in my city from Feb-August of this year. They paid me pretty well at $15/hour, and I enjoyed my work: I was writing lots of marketing copy, making creative decisions that affected the company's public brand, part of a small and really well-educated and effective team. I quickly took on more responsibility and I did well, and towards the end of my internship the CMO of the company - let's call her April - started hinting that she wanted me to stick around after the summer was over.

Since I was doing my last semester of college (am currently on track to graduate in December), and would need a semester job, I jumped on the opportunity and asked to stay on through December working 3 days per week. She agreed, and offered to give me the job of setting up and project-managing the company's annual customer conference – a $120,000-budget event that is the CEO's personal ""baby."" I thought it was an honor to be trusted with such a significant project, and agreed! She said I'd have about 2 days per week of work on this project, and one day per week of the same kind of work I'd been doing, which I could continue doing with my existing manager – let's call him John.

**The Present:**

Fast forward to now, and the dynamics of my workplace and of my actual work have completely changed. Once I started my second internship, I started being assigned tasks and being managed directly by the CMO. April has begun loading me up with more, and more, and more work, to the point where I feel completely overwhelmed and have had to resort to working 40-50 hours per week to complete all of it. When I miss or push back on deadlines, I am told that I'm lazy, or incompetent, or not meeting the standards of the company. 

Often, April assigns me work with seemingly large consequences (such as designing sales campaigns to potential $10,000 sponsors of this event) but provides little or no guidance as to how she wants those tasks carried out – she just tells me to make them happen, and I am left to invent them from scratch. It's hard for me to adequately express how MUCH work I'm being given. It feels utterly paralyzing. What's worse is that April reacts very aggressively and demeaningly when I ask for help: her standard response is to imply that I'm incompetent for asking, and then tell me to ask John for help. John is always too busy with the mountain of work that April has assigned HIM to help me, and he has told me explicitly, ""Do not ask April for help: she will not help you, she doesn't care how the 'sausage is made.' Come to me and I'll try to help if I have time.""

I have daily deadlines stretching all the way out until May, even though they know I'm graduating and moving away in December. That brings me to my next point: the possibility of a job offer.

**The ""Job Offer""**

About a month and a half ago, when I first became totally overwhelmed with work, I expressed my concerns to John. They were, in this order:

1. I never received a second internship offer letter, so I am working with no contract to specify the hours I agree to work or anything else;
2. I feel totally overwhelmed with the amount of work on my plate, and I don't know who to go to for help;
3. My mom is sick with a terminal disease (this is true) and I need time to spend helping to take care of her instead of working more when I get home;
4. I need to be able to finish my degree and graduate from college this semester, which feels tenuous given how much I'm expected to work.

When I brought up these concerns, he quickly shut me down and seemed panicked that I was pushing back on him (as if he might get in trouble if I quit). He responded by telling me that he knows things are tough right now, but he wants me to know that they're planning to make an exception for me and give me a full-time job offer as a remote marketing contractor so that I can stay on with the company at a full-time paid position when I graduate... AS LONG as I do a ""really really great job with setting up this conference."" That excited me, as I can really use the money and security of that position.

Unfortunately, for the past month and a half since that conversation, nothing has changed. The work load has only gotten worse. Even worse, every time something takes a little longer than expected or I slip up, John tells me ""April is really unhappy and you need to make sure everything is PERFECTLY buttoned up from now on or that contractor offer is off the table.""

**Where I'm At**

I just feel like I'm being exploited, I'm constantly afraid I'll be fired, I don't feel like the organizational structure is clear and I don't know who to ask for help. I'm afraid I'm on the edge of breaking down, but I don't want to lose the money if I don't have to, and I know that it's a little taboo to quit an internship. Interns are just supposed to suck it up and get through, to earn their place, right?

Thanks for reading you guys. I feel pretty overwhelmed and don't know where else to turn for advice. Any thoughts are welcome and appreciated.

Edit: 

So I spoke to a couple coworkers in the Marketing department about April’s management behavior. It turns out that a couple people have gone to HR about her management style and aggression and have been pressured to “get over it or quit”, since she’s sort of a legend in marketing and is “too valuable” to the company to face disciplinary action."

I currently live in the state of Arkansas and it is difficult finding an internship nearby. I don't want to have to travel too far just to get to the internship. I want to do the internship during the summer as that is pretty much the only good chunk of time I will have available. I know that it is hard to get an internship as a high school student but I would really like one as it could give me work experience which would be beneficial in the long run. I also don't have any personal connections related to Aerospace Engineering and even Engineering in general.

Experience:
Have used 3D Modeling software such as Autodesk CAD and Blender ;
Have used programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, MATLAB/GNU Octave, and more ;
Created a STEM-related club pertaining to game development ;
Was part of a Robotics team that placed 2nd in US Open  Nationals (helped by creating most of the robot, driving it around the area, and programmed part of it in RobotC) ;
Am a very passionate and hard-working person who is willing to learn and do whatever I can

What I Have Done Already:
Have looked at NASA Internship but have heard that it is very difficult to actually get the internship;
Looked at local aerospace-related companies and have contacted them but haven't made much progress;
Have talked with guidance counselor and am continuing to do so related to this topic

What should I do?

9s9zoi,5,2018-10-29,Defeating the Catch 22,kparker616,prevetstudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/prevetstudents/comments/9s9zoi/defeating_the_catch_22/,"One of my major stresses going into prevet was this catch 22:

&gt;How do you *obtain* experience without *previous* experience?

There was a long period of time where I felt hopeless about becoming a veterinarian. I was a first semester sophomore and still was not able to lock down a single clinical hour. To make a long story short, my previous college did not have a lot to offer and only wanted to give students with previous experience the internship opportunities that were available. This created an elitist mentality that I'm sure a lot of you have experienced in your time as a prevet. Students with this mindset were given the experience which made them a better candidate for future experience, so on and so forth, only widening the gap between us ""average"" students without a history in veterinary medicine, horseback riding, farm management, etc.

So this is my (quite extensive) survival guide for the *Average Joe* prevet who's feeling the icy grips of impostor syndrome:

1. **Get Involved**: The best way to find internship opportunities in and around your college is by joining your prevet club on campus. If you don't have one, speak to your advisor and create one! This is one of the best ways that alumni share their experiences about vet school and the application process, how upperclassmen share their success (and failure) stories and how they obtained internships/clinical hours, and what internship opportunities are in and around campus!
2. **On-Campus Experience**: You might be one of many prevets that already know what they want to be as veterinarians, but just like a premed student, you need to rack up as many diverse clinical hours as you can to be a competitive applicant. Keep your eyes peeled for any internship opportunities in the area and apply to as many as you can. Of course, be sure that they at least spark your interest a bit - there's no use *hating* what you're doing every day, but definitely be flexible with your personal preferences. If possible, join an animal management program! It's honestly one of the best ways to be super hands-on with animals and get a little GPA boost for doing what you love, even if shit shoveling is involved.
3. **Network**: Networking in the medical field is extremely important, especially if you're planning on applying to vet school. Talk to your on-campus veterinarians, speak with alumni, form a relationship with any/all doctors that you are able to internship with. Find a veterinarian that is willing to get to know you and sees potential in you! This is the person that will be able to write you the strongest recommendation and teach you invaluable lessons about vet med! Also be sure not to cut ties with anyone - always be kind to your peers and anyone you work with! You never know if/when you'll cross paths in the future.
4. **Shadowing**: Whether you were able to get an internship opportunity or not, shadowing is the *best* next step in building your resume and accumulating those clinical hours. Look into all the veterinary clinics in your area and keep a running list with addresses and phone numbers. Go down the list in order of what's most convenient/fits your interests most and give them a call. Explain you're an eager prevet student seeking a shadowing opportunity! Shadowing is unpaid, but it's invaluable experience and clinics (etc) are much more open to having a part-time shadowing student than accepting applications for a part-time unexperienced employee.
5. **Summer Jobs**: The moment you've all been waiting for! Obtaining a summer internship/job is honestly going to be contingent on what you've accomplished on steps 1-4. Build. That. Resume. This is where prevets will learn the true meaning of rejection (I know I did). Apply, apply, apply - and start early! Searching and applying for full/part-time jobs should start as early as March (if your classes end in May). Make and keep a list, just like step 4, and don't be afraid to call every office on your list. Join a site like LinkedIn to create a more professional online presence and find job postings on sites like Indeed. These are invaluable resources that are sure to make you a more competitive applicant. It is also important to mention not to be *too* ambitious. Depending on your previous experience, start somewhere small like a kennel/boarding job (at a vet clinic) - somewhere that you can be around the animals, see what the day-to-day is like, and form relationships with the staff. This will create a doorway for you to possibly shadow in your free-time and potentially get a technician job in subsequent summers. No matter where you apply, be sure to dress professionally, bring a copy of your resume to any interview, and email the clinic to thank them for their time. This will leave a lasting positive first impression!
6. **Catch 22**: As I said before, prevets get stuck in the catch 22: I can't *obtain* experience without *previous* experience. This is often times one of the most discouraging parts of prevet med; DON'T GET DISCOURAGED! If at first you don't succeed, try try again....and again....and again. The more you put yourself out there, keep an open mind, and remain dedicated to success, you WILL see results. Believe me - small anecdote - but I applied to over 15 places, went to 2 interview, and spent about three months beginning in late March before I *finally* got hired. And guess what? It was my *dream job* working under a veterinarian who was *excited* to mentor me just as I was thrilled to work with her!
7. **Keep a Record of EVERYTHING**: Excel/Google spreadsheets are your new best friend! Keep track of EVERYTHING. I can't stress this enough. Every clinical hour, every veterinarian you work with's name and contact information, every barn, clinic, and ride-along that you participate in - WRITE IT DOWN. Keeping a record is extremely important when applying to vet school and with networking. You never want to be in a position where you don't remember the vet you worked with on xxxx day at xxxx place. Just trust me on this one. It's freaking important.
8. **You Got This!**: This concentration is what you make of it - so hang in there! As stressful and seemingly impossible at times it can be to be a prevet, always remember that perseverance is what sets us apart from everyone else! Remember to take care of yourself in the process, take a breath, and know that at the end of the day everything will be okay. Plus, this page is here for you, too! And we *get it*! Life sucks sometimes but we gotta keep keeping on. Together, we'll make it into vet school - I know it!"
9sa649,0,2018-10-29,[F4A] Crime Romance RP (Potentially Dark),writerrp,Roleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/9sa649/f4a_crime_romance_rp_potentially_dark/,"Hello all! So I’ve been binge watching quite a few crime shows and have been inspired by a particular one. I’m searching for someone to play a male character named Thomas Blunt, who is a charmingly young and brilliant CEO of a modern tech company. He’s arrogant and cold, but as you can see this is a romance RP so while he’s still a rich prick, that might change over time.

Here’s the catch though! Thomas has committed a murder.. If you can’t tell already, the 26 year old has some issues. To be specific, anger issues. As a young billionaire, people are always trying to use him or sue him. One day, a particular employee of his attempts to sue and steal credit for one of his newest tech ideas, and Tom simply threatens for him to stop trying. He gets ticked off at the attempt by his own employee though, and takes his anger out on his innocent flight attendant - basically, he accidentally takes her life after excessively expressing his anger and pushing her down the stairs, to which she broke her neck.

Or was it an accident?

That’s the fun part of this plot, because you can make Thomas however you like. He could be a psychopath if  you really want him to be (who has a soft spot for her), or he could feel awful about what he did. Obviously, let’s not kill off the female character I will be playing as, because it is a romance RP after all! I just think it’d be interesting to see how she might handle his situation (liking and eventually having feelings for a murderer), and how he might handle her.

The female character I will be playing is Mika Durand, and she could either be his right hand man at the company who keeps things running smoothly, a mere stranger who recognizes him from the news of his temporary arrest, or perhaps even an intern at the police department who takes a strange liking to him.

If you’ve made it this far, I apologize for how lengthy this turned out to be and thank you for your time. If you’re interested in playing as Thomas Blunt, please send me a message and I’ll be happy to use whatever platform you like!"

I am currently starting my freshmen year of college at my local community college and my state college doing a 2-2 program and I will graduate from my CC with two certificates in CJ, homeland security and private investigations. Then I will graduate from UNC Pembroke with a Bachelors in Criminal justice. 

*during my junior and senior year summer's I plan to apply for an internship with the FBI, since my main goal is to be an intelligence analyst* 

And since IT seems to be a big thing right now, I was wondering if doing my minor in that would benefit me greatly, or if I should minor in something else that I find interesting/tolerable. Like public admin, finance or something else you might recommend that I cannot think of at the moment.

Once I graduate what jobs would be open to me? Traveling is not an issue and I have great social skills and can somewhat speak, read and write Russian. I should be fluent by the time I graduate. 

Thanks for all your help, I really need it right now.

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

9sc8xg,1,2018-10-29,Volunteering is the biggest stressor in my life but I can't seem to say no.,justthrowitawaynow12,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9sc8xg/volunteering_is_the_biggest_stressor_in_my_life/,"A little background on me: I'm a 28yo female and for as long as I can remember, I've been busy. I started working at 15 and at 16 I was already working 25-30 hour weeks while attending school. In college, I always worked at least full time with periods of juggling a second job or internship. I worked 2 jobs my first couple of years out of school. Some of this was out of necessity, but some has been driven by this need to feel constantly productive. When I finally scaled back to one full time job, I felt so guilty that I wasn't doing enough and this is where volunteering has come into play.

I love animals. I have 3 of my own and also foster. Two years ago, I decided to get more involved with the rescue, picking up an additional role where I have so many foster homes assigned to me. I work with the foster homes on any issues they have that arise and also process applications that come in for the animals in these foster homes. This takes up at least an hour of my day, every day, but most days it is more. The problem is that there is a culture developed at the rescue of urgency and of always being available. If I don't try to tackle things as they come up, they build up and become more stressful. For context, I checked my email Saturday night around 830pm and when I checked it Sunday at 930am I had 44 emails. I don't get days off from volunteering. The rescue has a few paid staff, but is primarily volunteer run. 

I currently work in social services and was recently promoted to a management position. I work with people all day and then I come home and work with people at night.  It's exhausting. I've wanted to step down from my volunteer role, but there is constantly new fosters coming in that need someone to step up to work with them. We are all so busy already that everytime someone new comes up they are begging for someone to work with them. So instead of stepping down, I've taken on more work. 

Constantly feeling like I need to be available is so exhausting. I've always suffered from regular migraines, but they have become more frequent as of late and I imagine stress doesn't help. My boyfriend is tired of me being on my phone all the time. If I'm working out or walking my dogs or on vacation, I struggle being present in the moment knowing that there is so much work I'll need to do later. I wake up and immediately have a compulsive need to check my email. Between work, rescue, walking my dogs and caring for my own animals/foster animal, my workout schedule, and taking care of the home I feel constantly busy. 

All of that being said, I worry that if I step down, I'll feel guilty because I know that the work we are doing is important and that I'm not contributing anymore. I've been busier in my life and other people are busier than me that seem to manage this role so what is wrong with me that I cant handle it? And how can I step down now that I just committed to more work? If I step down, that makes more work for the other volunteers. 

I'm just so tired of feeling this way. I'm mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted but I have no idea how to walk away.

9schgu,1,2018-10-29,5 Stages of an Intern,poor_icarus,u_poor_icarus,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_poor_icarus/comments/9schgu/5_stages_of_an_intern/,"**1) Denial**

As the holidays come near an end and the cicadas emerge from their burrows, you are supposed to already planned your move and maybe even pack your bags and car, but instead, you still prefer to roll around in your t-shirt and shorts while singing to your confused and terrified cats.

The terrors of adulthood lie before you, hidden like landmines, but you have to step on them and endure the injuries in order to move forward in life. There's no other way other than staying in the same square till the end of times.

You know nothing about the difficulty of living alone in a foreign city, where there might be no relatives or friends to throw you a rope, and definitely no other college kids to blunder with. 

Subsequently, you definitely know nothing regarding what to do the first week. Like locating the gas station and supermarket and other useful facilities, such as a clinic that sells sick leaves, if you... err... ever need one desperately, and where the best chicken satay and nasi goreng kampung are.

The company you're going to work for remains shrouded in mystery, because, why waste five minutes on Google to look it up? Why not instead enjoy the blockbusters that roll out endlessly in this time of the year? Or go visit your grandmother deep in the jungle and gather some durians? Or play your favorite video games for the third time? 

""Beware,"" nobody said... not even you to yourself. 

Depending on who you ask, the internship is either tiring or boring. But for some reason, you think it's going to be fun because college was fun. You think an internship is like a college semester, where the only thing that matters is you fulfill some of the requirements set.

So then comes the day you start your internship.

There are other kids your age or just a few years older. They are all fresh and bright. This is going to work out easy, you think. You exchange names and backgrounds and go eat together when the moon rises. 

**2) Anger**

So. Many. Rules! 

And you can't seem to remember any of them.

Not only that, you can barely survive with the tiny wage, or catch any sleep in the tiny bed provided by the hot and cramped roach-infested hostel, or get your shit together in such a quick and professional environment, because every minute is money, right?

You write a lot of rants on Facebook or Instagram, and you quietly rebel by taking days off or coming back from lunch fifteen minutes late. 

Of course, this results in punishments or scoldings, and thus creates a feedback loop, until you one day have a mental breakdown and drive to your parents' home at two in the morning and skip work for three days. 

The Human Resource department is alerted and you are transferred to another department. You're shaken. But it doesn't fix anything. You skip work again to fly overseas, just to party with older men and alcohol, as an escape from your life and a way to restart your mind.  

Without realizing, at work, your name has become alike to spoiled garbage, smelly and festering with maggots. 

**3) Bargaining**

It has only been one month, and both parties are already stressed. It's like a quiet war is going on. This can't continue. You have to do something because at this point, your termination seems inevitable and you might have to repeat and delay your graduation and undergraduate studies. Your parents would be furious and everyone in your class would be shocked to find out because you weren't the kind to play hookey. 

So... it's time to better yourself?

Let's try that. 

And try to understand the point of this internship?

Yeah, let's try that too. 

You decide to let go of everything from the past -- your dreams, your fears, your assumptions, and even yourself. If you ever had a dream other than being an engineer, let it go. If you ever liked wearing anything than corporate uniforms and safety boots, forget it. If you dislike big corporations, change. 

You become dust. Wherever they blow you to, there you go. 

Let's hope you finish this internship without any more bumps along the road. 


**4) Depression**

Thumb in. Thumb out.

That's your life now, nothing more or less. You become just another machine in the factory, following orders, otherwise just sitting quietly. You don't feel you belong. Everyone stares at you, or you feel they do. And you know they talk about you behind your back, and they don't say nice things. 

Walking in the factory, you get harassed by the operators, they howl at you, but you don't feel anything anymore. Your heart has shut down, and you don't know when it did that. Your mind is running on autopilot mode. 

People... don't notice you. They don't say anything to you and avoid looking at you. You start questioning your existence. Do people think you are a ghost? You mark the calendar every passing day as a way to remind you that one day, your prison sentence will come to an end and you will see the light again and be warm and happy. 

The only time you're the slightest bit alive is when you're driving because nobody sees or judges you, and you have no expectations to uphold in the car, other than to practice road safety. You're just another driver. Nobody cares if you're a lazy ugly fuck failure when you're on the road. They don't even want to know your name. They just want to get wherever they need to be without you obstructing them. 

Driving is a brief escape from your tarnished identity and the society you couldn't fit in. 

You don't eat. You smoke. You drink. You waste away and start to actually look dead, like your soul. Your skin becomes bumpy and your hair full of dandruff from the showers you skip. Your clothes have coffee and makeup stains. Almost as if you want to present yourself this way, to let everyone know you're suffering. You smell really bad too as if a cat pissed on you. 

At this point, you have long ceased contact with anyone from the outside world and vice versa. You are alone. There's no one to talk to other than the stars. You tumble and tumble in the ocean, waiting for the day God perform a miracle and resurrects you. 

Will He?

You don't know. 

One day, you start asking everyone about God. You read any holy books in your way. You pray in every way possible. 

**5) Acceptance**

The sun emerges. 

But not on its own. You were the one that went backstage and worked on the pulley system to lift it above the horizon. You wanted to see light again. 

In a state of half-awake, you managed to move out from the hostel which you decide to be too toxic for your mental health to live in, and you now respect the schedules and the way they do things in the factory, it's not a problem for you. Not many things are a problem for you now.

Your bad reputation may be irreparable, as people's negative perception of you is like dry cement, but that's okay. You recognize your own growth, which is enough. 

Maybe you have understood the point of this internship, to a degree, but not completely, still, it's okay, you have until your last day and the lifetime after that to understand this experience, as you don't get to decide what an experience mean, instead, it has to reveal itself, time after time.

You've made many friends and created memories that surpassed your low threshold of expectation, so someday, you can say you had a good time here. 

You've grown to love this place, and the people inhabiting it, whether they are nice to you or not, and despite the bitter memories, you choose to remember the sweet ones and make more of them. 

You want to stay, but soon your heart craves an adventure, you long to be beside the clouds again in that blue, blue sky. You want to meet new people, again. And start over, again."

Looking through internship websites, most of them are (understandably) geared towards drawing in students or new grads for possible future employment. On the other hand, I'd just be looking to come in part-time during the weekends when I don't have work.

Asked a couple co-workers about it but wasn't able to get much info. What I know is:

1)It isn't impossible

2)I'd need my current company's permission

3)If income outside my regular job surpasses 20万, I'd be required to submit a 確定申告書.

If anybody has any information or knows if this is a thing at all, it'd be a great help. Thanks!

Here is some context :

* I am a 23 years old boy, 3/10, obese, baldness, brown hair, a lot of friends but I never had experience with women
* She is a 22 years old girl, 6/10, sporty, blonde hair, a bit shy
* We have been friends for 4 years, but we lost sight during the last two years because I had to move. But we still stayed in touch.
* We have many passions and interests in common. We laugh a lot together.
* Carpool every two weeks together.
* In September she moved to the same city as me in order to continue her studies (same as mines).
* In October she complained that we did not see each other enough. I went out with her 2 times and we had lunch together.
* She invited me for a mountain trip (with other friends). I was agree but I denied later because of my schedule.
* I think she is coveted by other men more beautiful than I am.

I planned to start sport next week and I will try to go out with her more often, do activities etc...

Then, when I am ready (December~February I hope), I will tell her how I feel. If she feels the same that's good, we will continue to see each other. Otherwise I will start my internship (end of study) and I will not see her anymore.

So, what's your opinion ? Am I just a friend ? Should I tell her my feeling or keep them for me in order to save our friendship ?

Thank you

This is because ‘normal jobs’ never really got my interest and I didn’t needed the money (don’t ask me about it).

When possible I specialized in 2 Minors:
1. Social Media &amp; Business 
2. Digital Business

I have done a few courses and completed some certificates:

2. Google Ads Search Engine Cert. - Google
3. Google Digital Garage Cert. - Google
4. SEO Traning Course - Moz
5. Inbound Marketing Cert. - HubSpot
6. Email Marketing Cert. - Hubspot
(I want to do more courses regarding Email Automation, Adobe Photoshop, Advanced Excel, etc.)

I got little to some experience with WordPress, HTML, Excel and CMS like Hootsuite and Google Analytics.

I’ve read about +/- 30 books on topics, Business, Entrepreneurship and Online Marketing.

But still I feel like I’m missing things to really stand out. Yes I got some certificates and theoretical knowledge, but that is it. Sooo my final question is:

9se7o4,12,2018-10-29,Want to make better software? Here's some assumptions developers make that could be wrong:,ZerothLaw,rust,https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/9se7o4/want_to_make_better_software_heres_some/,"I'm a professional developer, but Rust is what I do for fun. 

Here are some resources we use at my day job to deliver better software, and given the community's focus on ""Doing The Right Thing"" feel that they would be valued here:

 * [Did I remember to? A checklist of commonly forgotten things to check or do with software](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/micahel/2004/07/07/did-i-remember-to/ )
 * [Falsehoods Programmers believe about time](https://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time ) 
 * [Falsehoods Programmers believe about names](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/ ) 

That last one is particularly relevant as we had an intern with a last name with a dash in it, and the dash broke the new flagship product during development. 

So even major companies with hundreds of programmers can miss these small things. Having actual checklists to reference can be very useful because we are flawed beings. 

Hope this helps! "
9se9ni,22,2018-10-29,Can we talk about how bad armor sets are in BfA so far?,thedude1329,wow,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9se9ni/can_we_talk_about_how_bad_armor_sets_are_in_bfa/,"When Blizzard first announced that they are taking out class-specific armor sets, I expected that they would put more effort and polish into the new, armor type specific sets. For me, the Pandaria challenge mode sets are some of the best looking armor they ever done, and I inevitably compare any new sets to them. Legion did bring some pretty cool sets, and they did a good job with Order Hall sets for each class, as well as the Trial of Valor sets that looked pretty badass. Meanwhile, weapons were a huge focus of Legion, and every class had a ton of exciting colors, models, etc for multiple weapons.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've seen so far from Battle for Azeroth is frankly disappointing and underwhelming. The plate set from Uldir looks like it was slapped together by a summer intern in MS Paint, and other sets are not very exciting either. As a mail-wearer, I have not seen a single piece of armor drop where I was like ""wow, this looks awesome"". Weapons are pretty meh as well, and I haven't seen anything even in 8.1 that is getting me very excited about it from an appearance standpoint. It feels like we have fewer armor sets AND the ones we have are not very good.

&amp;#x200B;

Admittedly, Blizzard is knocking it out of the park with Heritage armor sets, but I feel like this should not take away from showing some love to the raid drops.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Are there any armor / weapon appearances that you've really liked in Battle for Azeroth so far?

I used Treesize Free to [take a look at](http://puu.sh/BSVfN.png) some of the space hogging directories, and I think Ubi might want to re-pack their forge files a bit more frequently like they did during Operation Health.

Last year I took a one year technical training course for web programming and development. This course included but wasn't limited to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C#, PHP, MySQL. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the course I had to find myself an internship. I got one at a small start up, and they decided to hire me after the internship was over with the help of a government subsidy. My boss was more than happy when he saw I also have a degree in Liberal Arts, considering most of the people I work with don't have English as their first language. He decides to use me as his lackey for documentation writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me give a brief rundown on my tasks at this company for the past 8 months:

\- Front-End development with HTML, LESS, and a bit of AngularJS

\- Hot Fixes on front and back end

\- Requirement gathering for projects I wasn't going to work on

\- Documentation writing for projects I wasn't going to work on

\- Then, around June he wanted me to design - all on my own - an entirely new API micro service able to consume several other APIs from other companies and be able to be agile enough to work with the requirements of 50+ other companies with their own requirements regarding data transmission, as well as make calls to other micro services in our system. So for this I did:

\- Requirement gathering

\- Documentation writing

\- UML2.0 Diagrams

\- Oh, and this all has to be done with MongoDB in Lumen using an Apache server in a Docker container. I've used none of these technologies before except for Apache. I've also never worked with micro services.

&amp;#x200B;

So now the time has come to actually implement the project, and I am just feeling completely overwhelmed and falling into a depression. I told my boss I haven't received enough experience on this job in order to implement this, even with the help of one other programmer (who's still in school for his bachelor's btw). I told my boss I'm still a junior developer and I don't have enough experience to do this properly and that I need a team leader to guide me. His response was I'm no longer a junior dev I'm an intermediate dev now...

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest fear is that I've been taken advantage of by writing so much documentation, that I'm actually a worse programmer now than at the beginning of my internship, and that now I won't be able to find a job if I started applying to other companies even though I'm in Montreal. 

Looking for advice please!

Hi  people, i (22M) have got a question for you, some time ago I met a girl  at a festival &amp; we started talking. She mentioned how she really  loved my eyes. We really had a click &amp; made out as well later.

Hung  out for the rest of the day &amp; eventually would also join us for the  afterparty. Exchanged numbers &amp; scheduled a date (1,5 weeks layter)  which went really well.  We also made plans for a second date.(I did  stay over the night since she lives in another town. Was gonna stay at a  friends house but everything went really well so things turned out  differently)

However later she said she  wasnt ready for a relationship &amp; that she really loved the date but  that she just wasnt ready yet.

Another  thing that might be playing a role is that im leaving for my internship  for 5 months. Im just gonna go follow my internship in greece. Maybe ill  meet someone there maybe not if not i might ask her out again when i get back home (if i still want to of course).

What do you think? Am i handling this right?

I have offers from PwC and DHG for my spring internship next semester and I am having such a hard time choosing. Most internships turn into full-time offers (waiting for you after finishing MAC/MSA) if you preform well. 

I really like both firms and all the people I’ve talked to. The thing that is making it the hardest to choose is if I go with the Big 4 and hate it (bc of work-life balance or “I’m just a number”), I’ll be back to looking for a position instead of having one waiting for me after my Graduate year. If I go with the smaller firm, I’ll be worried I missed out on something, and people have told me it’s a a lot harder to work up to a Big 4 than move down from one. Plus after doing some research, the difference in salary is pretty large after a few years. 

Work life balance is important to me, but I have aging parents who are not in a good financial situation that I want to be able to care for.

9shbmb,28,2018-10-29,[30M] My Wife [33F] feels she might need to switch teams,growmal,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9shbmb/30m_my_wife_33f_feels_she_might_need_to_switch/,"My wife and I have had some (manageable) problems for a bit now, but we're seeing an EFT therapist which has helped immensely in some regards. We've been married 9 years and together almost 11. We married young and that's not helped much, but we've grown and worked through it.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this summer she formed a slightly innapropriate relationship with a female coworker (and intern in her office for just a few weeks before moving back to her side of the country), where from what I've been told they just fooled around a little and made out, but all clothes stayed on. It started with just a kiss, and then through a couple/few weeks progressed a bit. We've played around with a few women before, together, so while this wasn't a HUGE deal it blew up a bit with the other issues we've been having. At one point I told her if she continued that relationship beyond just friends, I would consider it cheating. I was willing to ignore what had happend up to that point since it was a bit of a gray area. I made and set a clear expectation that she agreed to, but then ended up kissing her again a couple nights later.  This was back in July/August. Mixed into all this was a lot of lying, deception and the usual affair-type shenanigans. She was staying out late, not talking to me at all, all that good stuff. Very unexpected behavior from her from the patterns we'd established.

&amp;#x200B;

EFT therapy has been going well, we've had ups and downs. Things are improving between us but my wife has remained quite distant, distracted and very guarded against me. Through our talks, it appears that what happened with that woman has really stirred up some deep seeded feelings and confusion in her. She's been attracted to girls for as long as she can remember, but grew up in a conservative town with a fairly conservative (trump voting fwiw) family so she repressed all of those feelings and ended up marrying me. NOW, after all this she's feeling like maybe she isn't being true to herself and that maybe she's supposed to love a woman instead of a man. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's concerned because she doesn't want to throw away a salvageable marriage. If she feels strongly enough that she's going to need to switch teams, she knows she'll have to leave me to chase that down. She can't expect to have her cake and eat it too, and she's smart enough to know that. She also realizes that maybe because it was new, exciting, sorta taboo and forbidden that it could just be a lust and an itch that she scratched and it may not be right. She's committed to, and is trying to find a sexual therapist to help her work through this, and I'm hoping it moves relatively quickly in that regard. I'm strapped into a really shitty rollercoaster, with no influence or control or ability to do anything to affect the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I love my wife, and I know that she loves me. Things are hard right now, but I do want what's best for her. How do I best support her? I want nothing more than to continue my life with her, and I'm addressing and have addressed a lot of my fault into how things got a bit disconnected before all of this went down. She says that if she can get past this feeling and that she can figure out how to stay with me, she's committed to continuing therapy and to try to keep working through it which is great. But we have a MAJOR hurdle to hop before we get there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling lost, empty, helpless, scared, terrified and a nonstop sense of impending doom. I've lost 20lbs (which isn't bad, I could stand to lose a few more) in an unhealthy way (not eating). I'm not sleeping that well, and my work performance has greatly suffered. I'm usually a very high performer and have talked with my leadership about  it -- they and my team have been very graciously covering for my inconsistencies right now and are giving me as much time as I need to work through it. I cry a lot when I think about losing my wife, and the good times we've had, and the work we've done and are doing to improve things with our EFT therapist. I want to spend the rest of my life with her, but she may not be able to spend it with me. Fuck."
9shnmi,2,2018-10-29,How do I (29ftm) get over my sister (31F)?,AbaloneHo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9shnmi/how_do_i_29ftm_get_over_my_sister_31f/,"My sister and I have always had trouble getting along, even as little kids. We're the only children in our family, and I remember desperately wanting her to play with me and her rejecting me. She had lots of neat stuff because she was more forthright about asking for toys, and later makeup and things like that, than I was. I took stuff from her for years. My mom confirms that this was maybe more than the average sibling borrowing of stuff, and it drove my sister BONKERS. 

&amp;#x200B;

She had a very troubled adolescence, and at one point was nearly institutionalized.  She clearly suffered a great deal,  but it wasn't any fun having a sibling in the house who would scream (and if she was in a terrible mood, claw at me) for things like me being too loud or existing in ways she didn't like. I came out as gay when I was 12. My parents seemed overwhelmed in dealing with us, and essentially raised us as two only children. I can remember no occasions where we had to work things out on our own because we always wound up running to our parents to have them solve the problems. We spent a lot of time separately hanging out with one parent at a time. My parents took us both separately to therapy from the time I was pretty young, and that helped me a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was always told that there was some kind of diagnosis for her, but never exactly what it was. She engaged in a lot of self mutilation like picking the skin around her cuticles until they bled, which made me feel sick to my stomach. Those behaviors have mostly cleared up as she's gotten older. She's still very controlling, and particularly of me. For example, I can't sing or hum or listen to music in her presence. She once found what I thought was a pretty innocuous comment I made on Reddit about the importance of taking care of yourself when dealing with difficult family members, and made a huge issue of me violating her privacy.  

&amp;#x200B;

Our parents paid for me to go to a private college because I had the grades for it and a good scholarship, but she nearly dropped out of high school and was only accepted at a not very well regarded state college. As we've grown older, she's found monetary success in a field she doesn't like very much, and I've gotten a moderately prestigious graduate degree in a field I love that doesn't pay very well (yet!). I think there's maybe some envy on both our parts.

There's a million cruel little things she's done over time, but the thing that really haunts me has to do with her wedding. She got married when I was still in grad school and asked me to be in her bridal party. I came out as non-binary a little over a year before her wedding, and our parents were not thrilled. Due to the timing of a required internship and the surgeon's schedule, I wound up needing to get top surgery during her bachelorette party. When I let her know about the scheduling conflict months in advance over text, she told me that I always ruin everything like this, that I was faking being non-binary to steal attention from her on her big day, and generally would always be an inferior person and a child. My surgery went fine, I wore the dress she picked out and stood up beside her on her wedding day. We essentially have not talked in private since. She has never apologized for what she said.

&amp;#x200B;

I got married this year, and she declined to be involved in every way possible, from attending a shower, having a role in the ceremony, to coming to the legal ceremony the day before. I had to find her and her husband as they were leaving at my reception to even say a word to her.

&amp;#x200B;

When I've tried to sit down with her and talk things out, she tells me that I'm a thief who always takes her stuff. I can't tell you how many times I've apologized, and asked what I could do to make it up to her. I've tried asking her about her life, asking her what it would take for her to forgive me, what she would want an adult relationship for us to look like (she says she would like me to leave her alone forever). I've read books, talked to therapists, talked to my wife about this so much that she's absolutely sick of hearing about it, with no progress. I have dreams about her all the time. I feel like I'm still a little girl chasing after my sister, trying to get her to love me.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this relationship is beyond repair, and I need help figuring out how to move past this. She has told me that she wants me to leave her alone, and I do, but it hurts a lot. Talking to therapist about this particular issue has not been helpful. I wind up ranting when I need help not getting so worked up about it. I'm unwilling to give up things like going home for Christmas to never see her again. What do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Sister and I have had a rough relationship all our lives, and she's said some particularly cruel things to me as an adult. She has no interest in repairing the relationship. How do I move on?

NEED HELP !",B_jennings,climbharder,https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/9sht32/switching_from_good_looking_clean_gym_to_dirty/," A brief story: I'm beginner from north east, Thailand. I've been climbing just over a year(only outdoor), before that I did calisthenics for a few years. My highest outdoor: V5+(only 1, my seasonal project).  I got a great internship opportunity in Szczecin, Poland and had 4 months to train my ass off. Priority goal is to climb atleast 1 V7, and a bunch of other grade below. 

* My strength : crimp(but not enough to climb V7, as I tried one problem before I left my country which I couldn't even pull the first move.), core. 
* My weakness : Pumpy forearm,  ~~Technique~~(It's getting way better now just after a month in gym, I gained better footwork, my backstep was getting way more fluid, I was finally able exploit the flag move. I found myself strangely be able to read the routes now, eventhough not the best way to solve the problems and will continue to work on it.

**I have taken ''just climb'' approach for almost a month now, but the problem is..** 

This clean looking gym has limited number of problems(no more than 35 problems including atleast 5 warm up and 10 V0-V1 ), I've done all the problems so far, except the 7B/7B+ gym style that I'm not pysched to work on. It's getting boring to just keep climbing the same problems over and over, So I decided to move to this new dirty looking, old school gym I found today.  


As you can see this new gym doesn't set up problem, only puts holds on different angle walls. Other than that they have weight room (bench press and couple pairs of dumbell) and hangboard.

**Since I have not done any kind of systematic training before, I have no idea how to apply ''Just climb''  approach to this old school gym as I did in my previous gym having problems set up on wall.** 

**Could you folks give me some advice or idea on training ?**

Any advice will be appreciated. Cheers !!!

9shyjt,0,2018-10-29,[M4F] Forbidden Relationships and Seduction Scenarios / Several Prompts,Dan_DPP_,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9shyjt/m4f_forbidden_relationships_and_seduction/,"Hey All -

*disclaimer: I am an adult that is over 18 in search of other adults that are 18+ for fantasy play*

I am absolutely turned on by all kinds of forbidden relationships. Please read to the end. I had lots of fun with this yesterday. 

Think about how many different types exist: teacher/student, boss/secretary, coach/player, father/daughter, the possibilities are almost endless. Today, I have a few scenarios to offer: 

New) The Yoga Instructor - I’d play any number of roles - brother, boyfriend’s Dad, best friend’s boyfriend, teacher, whoever, that walks in unexpectedly to your yoga class (or a class where you are a yoga student) and it turns out I need some extra help, which you are generous enough to offer.

1. You're a new intern in the office, and a bit younger than usual. But that's okay. Trial by fire isn't going to be difficult for you, with a body like that, you've definitely been treated like an adult before. But just wait until you see how I'm going to treat you like you're grown. 
2. We've always had a good relationship as teacher/student. When you join my club and we start to spend more time together, things spiral quite quickly into a mutual affair.
3. We're vacationing in a ski cabin in the Rockies when your mother, my wife (can be step-father or actual father), gets called back to the city on business. I've had my eye on you for about a year. How nice it is to have my own little snow bunny to myself.
4. It's Wedding time, and you're a bridesmaid. A good ole cliche.
5. So many more scenarios. What's on your mind? I’m definitely open to variations on a theme of any of these.
6. I’m also open to chatting about why these scenarios are so hot.

My limits are simple: Feet, Bathroom, Gore

My kinks: Seduction, Dirty Talk, Big Cocks, Cum Play, Lingerie, Reluctance to Enjoyment, Eating Pussy, Blowjobs, Multiple Orgasms, and so much more.

Please be able to put a sentence together while playing. I'm open to playing with a guy that can play a female convincingly.

Hope to chat soon.

9sid0c,7,2018-10-29,My ex hates me even though he’s the one who dumped me.,Hounddoom76,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9sid0c/my_ex_hates_me_even_though_hes_the_one_who_dumped/,"My ex dumped me last month. I cried and pleaded with him to change his mind for a few minutes, but ultimately let him go. I kissed and hugged him one last time. The breakup was difficult because it was sad, not because there was yelling or anger. He cried a lot when he did it, saying he was selfish for leaving me but that he just was no longer in love with me. He said “I’m just a man. I deserve happiness too.” My response was “of course you do! You do! You deserve all the happiness in the world!”

He always victimized himself in our relationship. He made me believe I was abusive and manipulative. Whenever I was upset about ANYTHING, he got defensive and then blamed me for us having a “fight” (usually just a discussion where I would try to convince him to see why I was upset). Whenever I started to get him to see why his behavior was hurtful, he would start to cry. I would feel bad and then try to comfort him and end up apologizing. Then he would be distant and bitter for weeks over the “fight,” saying that I had caused a fight for being upset by his behavior. He said he never got to “win.” I don’t know why but I never thought to say “It’s not about winning. It’s not a contest.” I would always just weakly say “you do win sometimes.” 

For some reason, he convinced himself that I was abusive and would call him a “piece of shit” and “p—sy.” I never EVER said those words to him. Whenever I was upset, he over exaggerated the reaction in his memory. The most I ever said was “You’re being an asshole,” which is still bad but not as degrading and dehumanizing as telling him he was a worthless piece of shit and a p—sy. He had a very, very bad memory, and he would leverage that to say “Just because I can’t remember specific times you’ve said those things to me doesn’t mean that you never have. You would never admit to me that you’ve said them.” 

He had it in his mind that I was an abusive, manipulative toxic person and it breaks my heart because I loved him and cared for him so much. I did such nice things for him that he might not ever remember. I used to bring him coffee fixed just how he liked in the mornings while he was still laying in bed. I used to make him waffles in the morning. I used to wake up in the middle of the night to put the blankets back on him when he was cold, careful to cover his feet. I used to cook his favorite foods every weekend. I’ve helped him clean his disgustingly messy apartment. I always let him spend time as much with his friends as he wanted without intruding, and was happy when he went out and had fun. I was happy whenever he went to visit family. I supported his life and relationships apart from me. When he couldn’t spend time with me for weeks and weeks last year because of school and work, I told him “don’t worry about me! Don’t worry about the relationship right now. Your mental health is more important.” I made him a list of self-care tips to put on his fridge. 

When he broke up with me, he said “I love you so much” and I said “But if you love me, then why do you have to leave?” He looked me dead in the eye and said “THIS is manipulation.” And I weakly just sputtered out “No, I don’t mean for it to be. I just can’t understand why.” I was barely able to speak because I was so sad and so scared that it might be true. I was afraid that I was manipulative, toxic, and abusive. 

He made me see myself as a monster. In the weeks after he left, I blamed myself a lot and went to therapy where I discovered that I am not manipulative or abusive. I’m a mentally and emotionally stable person who has normal, human reactions to things that upset me. 

But now, a whole month after the breakup, my ex hates me. He unfollowed me on Twitter. I don’t have Facebook, but he unfriended all my family, even though my family was very good to him. They loved him! We always had him over for holidays, always got him gifts, and took him on vacations. My dad (who doesn’t have FB but still) gave him an internship this summer so that he could have enough hours to graduate early. We’ve helped this guy a lot! And I understand breakups are awful and he wants nothing to do with me, but why do this to my family who loved him so much? Why couldn’t he just unfollow them all and then quietly unfriend them when everything smoothed over? We were together 6 years. It’s only been a month since we broke up. The wounds are still fresh. And for some reason it feels like a punch to the gut to discover him unfriending all my family NOW. I would have felt better if he did it all at the very beginning. 

After he dumped me, I did not contact him at all. It was a clean break. I was respectful of his decision. I can’t fathom why he’s doing all these hurtful things. It feels like he’s poking painfully at wounds that are still trying to heal. I feel like he hates me and is consumed with thoughts that I am abusive and manipulative. I don’t want him to remember me that way! Especially since it’s not true! I was just a normal girl who loved him. He wants to believe I’m a monster. 

TL;DR: my ex of 6 years convinced himself I was abusive and manipulative, dumped me, and though it was an amicable split, now hates me.

9simfg,2,2018-10-29,"I [F, 24], have a big crush on this INTP guy [M, 24] living 4000 km away, and I wonder if I should tell him...",lilijek,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9simfg/i_f_24_have_a_big_crush_on_this_intp_guy_m_24/,"Here's the situation.

I'm 24 and I'm a French student. I did an internship in Russia from March 2018 to July 2018. There, I met this boy, he's 24 too and he studies in the city where I did my internship. He's French too, I think it's important to mention. He's really my type in terms of physical appearance AND personnality. I began to develop a crush on him a few days after having met him. It took us some time to really get to know each other because we're both introverts. I'm INFP and he's INTP.

We were meeting at least once or twice a week, with our other friends, as we were often going out to parties, for a beer, to eat... After a few weeks, I convinced myself I mistook deep appreciation and friendship for love. I began to see him only as a very good friend. Noneoftheless, I still felt this ""weird thing"" for him, like a weird connection. And I couln't really tell what it was. It's like I was forbidding myself to like him, like if I was thinking it could never work anyway. After some time, we used to spend hours and hours, sometimes the whole night to talk about different topics, meaning of life, relationships, religion... He's a person I felt I could trust 100%. We also share common values, have the same political views...

When I left Russia, it was really difficult to tell him good bye. But it was not as difficult as the way I'm feeling now. We're still in contact. We text daily. We talk on Skype once every week or every two weeks. Our conversations usually last between 4 and 6 hours... My affection for him is growing bigger and bigger. I feel that he likes me too, he sometimes drops very subtle hints...  I sometimes do too... A few days ago, he sent me a funny meme of a couple, and wrote ""It could be us, but you live in \[name of my city\]"". I know such a hint sould be interprated as ""yes, he likes you!"". But he's so good at hiding his feelings, I really don't know anymore... I always tell myself he's just telling jokes... Because he'll drop a hint likt that and then... We won't talk about it for a few weeks... And then again... And he doesn't really react to the hints I'm trying to drop too...

I don't know if I can tell I'm in love with him, because I don't really know what being in love means... But I think of him daily, I miss him so much it hurts, thinking that I don't know when we'll see each other again makes me cry at night... I wonder if I should tell him, I thought about writing him a letter... But I'm terrified. If he rejects me, it'll break my heart. And I'm also so scared to destroy what we already have. It won't be the same ever again after that. But this situation is really making me suffer. He's not my boyfriend but I'm unable to be interested, even just a little, about an other guy. I'm unable to get even a little flity with another guy too.

On the one hand, I really feel the need to tell him I have feelings for him. On the other hand, I feel like an egoist for imposing him situation. It'll maybe put him in an uncomfortable situation, he didn't ask for it... Maybe I should just shut up and appreciate what we already have...

I know it sounds lame, but I feel like I've never felt such a thing for a boy before. I feel like no boy could be better than him, for me. And believe me, I used to be really cynical about love. I've had a few boyfriends before, I'm not that naive kind of girl who believes she found Prince Charming. It's just... Him.

Should I tell him? How can I cope with the situation? I feel lost.

Thank you to anyone who will read this whole post. I tried to make it as short as possible, I hope I didn't forget any important details."
9sitr1,452,2018-10-29,"War Dialer attempts to out-stubborn me in text. Trench warfare continues. I find the ""broken record"" method of gray-rocking effective. Nparents are secretly losing their marbles behind the scenes but still refuse to close the joint bank account.",Dracarys_Bitch,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9sitr1/war_dialer_attempts_to_outstubborn_me_in_text/,"**Edit**: [Here's the update](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9st6kp/update_war_dialer_attempts_to_outstubborn_me_in/). That joint account is annihilated. 


There is relevant backstory for my posts. Here's a quick recap:

*War Dialer is my nmom, and edad is her ever-loyal servant and faithful co-abuser, who really wishes everyone would placate WD so he doesn't have to be the scapegoat when we’re not present. He gladly offers up his children and his relatives as meat shields.*

*I recently returned their puppet-string car (title was always in their name), they don’t know where I live or work or how I’m getting transported around, and the last strings I have are the joint bank account and the health insurance. I have several severe autoimmune conditions that require constant monitoring and lab testing, so going without health coverage is not an option for me. In America you can stay on your parents' insurance until you are 26, but that's only if they re-enroll you each year during the enrollment period (typically Oct-Dec, Nov-Dec for the government marketplace plans). If they do not enroll me, my second choice is to enroll in the student health insurance offered through my university (which includes my doctors as in-network providers), and if all else fails, I will go on Medicaid (which is the free/reduced cost coverage for people under a certain income level, but none of my doctors accept it and I would have to pay them out of pocket.)*


********

Not sure how much I’m allowed to write about my sibling on here since this is MIL and Nmom focused, but I wanted to at least give a quick positive update since so many of you were SO helpful and supportive on that front. The update is more bittersweet, I guess. Edad and JNAunt completely cut off sibling’s access to all funds even though they promised they would support them for 3-6 months after GF’s death to help them get back on their feet. This is incredibly stupid as that means all the bills for GF’s house and properties will bounce – in addition to the car payments on the car GF bought for sibling after he totaled theirs. Hilariously, this also includes the cell phone plan that JNAunt is on, because she hasn’t paid her own phone bill in over a decade! That’s right, sibling or GF were paying it! Anyway, that will take a few more days to take effect. This week, actually. 

The GOOD news is, sibling is a hardcore planner and persister like me, and saw this coming as a worst-case scenario. They contacted some connections in a major city states away and was able to get arranged for a job interview and an apartment. They have turned off their phone, refused to be Edad and JNAunt’s secretary and errand-runner, and have flown the coop. Btw, their phone will also be cut when the cell phone bill bounces… but they retained a back up burner phone from years ago that they never used that was on a different plan. Plus, to tie it all up in a bow, a family friend came forward after seeing how sibling was hosed by all of this, and paid the retainer for their own lawyer to look into the estate, to make sure sibling gets what GF wanted them to have (and trusted his kids to dole fairly). There IS an argument to be made that by Edad and JNAunt receiving $14,000 a year from GF for pretty much their whole lives, their portion of the inheritance has already in fact been paid out… we’ll see what happens. That part is moving slowly and I probably won’t have updates for months. But all the cut-off notices and denial of access to funds and accounts is looking to be hugely incriminating. Edad and JNaunt are using a relative’s recommended lawyer (that works in the SAME FIRM as said relative) and swear that the lawyer is lawyering for “free” out of the “goodness of their heart”, but we all know no lawyers work for free on a huge estate like this. Huge conflict of interest going on there, but I’ll leave that to sibling’s fiery lawyer to sort out. And even if sibling gets nothing out of this, we are both happy that at least this might make Edad and JNAunt’s hosing harder. I mention all of this because I 100% believe War Dialer is pushing Edad to do this, and that Edad is also motivated to do this because he blames sibling for GF not wanting to see WD when he was dying. Instead of owning up that WD deserved her admonishment for her treatment of GF and his family for decades, Edad is choosing to attack sibling because they’re the easier target, and it takes WD’s heat off his back. Like I said, eager co-abuser.

*******

Throughout all of this, I’ve been fighting a war of attrition through text. WD often bragged that she is “the most stubborn person in the world” and would crow that she “can always out-stubborn me” any time I resisted any of her punishments as a little child. She seems to still believe that to be the case. What she is refusing to realize is that I am in no hurry to give a shit now that I’ve severed so many puppet strings. Even if their health insurance thing falls through, I can at least scrabble together some coverage for a year while I desperately apply for jobs with benefits (really hoping my internship will soften my fall with that route).

On and off over the past few weeks, I have been texting the nparents. I typically do not reply to texts the same day, and I especially do not reply on weekends when they are home and spending all of their waking hours on Facebook on their phones. My hard and fast rules are no personal meetings and no phone calls, because those have been abused in the past. My way or the highway.

Here is how the exchanges have gone – I am open to critiques on my replies as I am trying to be a firm, gray, broken record, that just repeats my needs over and over with no regard to anything else.

**Me**: The joint bank account still isn’t closed –as the primary owner, you have to walk in and sign a paper to close it. The bank says it takes 5 minutes tops. Either that, or you can mail them a notarized signature on a letter of intent to close the account (their neighbor is a notary). Most locations are open until X on weekdays and X on Saturdays (showing they can’t use work as an excuse for missing the bank). I don’t need access to the account anymore, close it so it’s over with.

**War Dialer**: How about we get together and talk about the car, the health insurance, the bank account? (Aka: how about I get my narc feed off of you in person for hours upon hours and then refuse to do anything you asked at the end of it!)

**Me**: We currently ARE talking about it. (Through text, is what I meant.) The car decision is out of my hands (aka nice try on that hook). If you call [bank], they will repeat what I have told you (you don’t need me to recite in person what I said through text.)

*[A day passes between messages]*

**War Dialer**: I don’t follow, who is this “we” and what are they talking about? (Aka: I suddenly don’t know English! Pander to my red herring! Look, a distraction!)


**Me**: The same “we” you were referring to. Us 3 in this group text.

**War Dialer**: [Dracarys], this isn’t talking. This is texting, it doesn’t substitute talking. Bring your bills and we can sit down together like we did at the [meeting place for the GODDAMN taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8chg2a/jnmom_in_we_have_to_do_the_taaaaaxes_part_2/) and talk. I don’t want any more misunderstanding. (Um, I understand everything perfectly, is this where a narc would say, “Sorry for your lack of understanding”? Also, lol at the implication that text is not somehow a valid form of communication. Yall KNOW the only reason she hates it is because she can’t interrupt me, can’t yell at me, can’t show me aggressive body language, can’t humiliate me in front of others…. The list goes on and on. Plus text is creating a paper trail of everything and I’m sure that’s not lost on her.)

*[For that attempt at strong-arming, I didn’t reply for 3 days. During this time, edad was texting me asking if I was going to JNaunt’s party thing in memory of GF coming up. Since my sibling had peaced out and the whole rest of the extended family knew why (and supported sibling, apart from the lawyer side of course), I saw no point in going, but I didn’t reply to his text. My presence or absence shouldn’t make a difference to their plans.* 

*Well… apparently he blew up sibling’s phone asking over and over if they’d heard from me, saying I was “giving them the silent treatment” and that was a “bad idea” and I was “acting strangely”. Sounded a bit threatening really, like bravado sputtered out of desperation.*

*Sibling lit them up saying they are not responsible for what every person in the family is up to on any day and they are done playing secretary, shut that shit right down. Basically this and a few other things confirmed my nparents are GOING NUTS that I am calmly spacing out my texts to them like this, and there’s not a thing they can do because I gave back their favorite puppet-string car to threaten to take!! They blame sibling, of course, for me returning the car, by the way. Insane.]*

**Me**: I have no bills to bring you. (I promise you that was a shock to them. I’m sure they felt smug that I would have to crawl to them to beg them to pay a bill eventually.) If you believe the health insurance premium will rise, use the car to pay for it, that’s the only bill relating to me. There is no point in talking if the joint account remains open. As the primary, you are the only one that can close it and my presence is not needed, just your signature. 5 minutes in and out.

*[A day later, day of the party]*

**War Dialer**: Why did you bring the car back? (Ah, another red herring to distract and divert! I know that question has been eating at them ever since I returned it a month ago. I let it sit for 2 days since I don’t reply on weekends.)

*[Today]*

**Me**: My reasons do not change the circumstances going forward, nor do they affect the closing of the joint account. (Aka, I know if I give you a reason you will latch onto it and dig and pry. Instead I’m not moved. Redirect back to what I want.)

**War Dialer**: Okay, what are the reasons? By the way, it is my account that I chose to share with you. (No shit lady?? That’s the literal entire point of why it has to be you to close it?? Kind of sounds like humble bragging about power at this point.)

**Me**: Obviously. If you would like to keep it, do so. Just remove me as a joint user.

**War Dialer**: Why is it so important to close the account?

**Me**: Because I have requested it, that is reason enough. It’s curious why you refuse such a simple request that does no harm to you. (I mainly said this in case I have to use these as evidence later in a civil hearing. Because I WILL use legal resources to get my name off that account if it’s the last thing I do. Plus she used “I said so!!!” as a reason a million times when I was growing up, I liked to pettily use it against her.)

**War Dialer**: That is not reason enough for me. Refusing to discuss anything is not going to solve anything. (Agreed, that’s why I was direct and to the point about what I want. I’m not the one filibustering here. I think she knows this is her very last thread of power over me and she’s dragging it out as looooooong as she can.)

I got a bit annoyed.

**Me**: Refusing to do a simple request for someone you claim to love on the basis of “I don’t wanna” is certainly not going to win any favors either. As an adult it is normal to separate joint accounts so as not to affect each other’s credit. It begs to question what you are hoping to gain by refusing this normal and routine task. (Aka, I see what you’re doing with your little power play bitch, though I think it went over her head.)

**War Dialer**: Why not discuss it like an adult then? (Are we… not doing that already? This is the most civil conversation I’ve had with WD in years!! No name calling even!) Why do I need to gain favor? What do I gain from it? I don’t understand (Ah yes, we forgot the English language again!) 

You can have your own account, No one ever said you could not, not ever (I’m aware? That’s completely not the issue here? I’m asking to be removed from an account, not make one!) But gaming around the answer is not good communication if you want to be understood. (Ahhhh, there it is, the victim blaming and gaslighting begins. Look back at our string of texts and tell me where I lost you. Is it “my” lack of good communication, or YOUR lack of cooperation?)

*I almost took the bait on this one, but remembered my strategy. Don’t budge. Wear them down with your demands. This is a war of attrition, and I have more resources this time.*

**Me**: We are discussing it as adults right now, using the latest communication technology to do so. I did not ask for an account, I am asking to be removed as a joint user from yours. That is all. (I don’t owe you an explanation bitch and you aren’t getting one. Plus lol at your implication that I’m being childish or less of an adult by only responding through text, love the classic infantilization there.)

That’s where it stands folks, minus a few random texts where WD claimed she couldn’t download my message. She only sent those messages to me and not the group text with edad, which I found suspect. I ignored those texts and found she would respond if I waited long enough.

**EDIT**: I had a feeling there'd be live updates.

**War Dialer**: My love for you is not based upon a bank account. (The biggest lie of the century, but we'll move on.) The bank account was something I shared with you, and I did not have to. It was because I wanted to, so as to help you, even after you turned 18 and an adult, as I did not have that first dime of help in life. (Cool, so you did what all normal bare minimum parents do, got it.) Somehow you took that for granted (??? by asking you to take me off the account so I DONT receive more money?) and somehow, when at times I tried to explain that I had bills too, you would berate me that I was not taking care of you. (Because you weren't. Because you bought a six figure house despite having your current one paid of, as well as a brand new car, and then cried to me that you couldn't send me grocery money like you promised when you forced me to go to the college of your choosing. When you KNEW I was incurring huge medical costs and needed help affording my medical diet. When you only offered to buy me food that I told you I couldn't eat, and then scoffed and acted like I was rude for politely declining.)

We are not talking as adults face to face. (Aka I can't suck any narc supply out of this, it's not fun). There is much to talk about (Aka I would like to give you an earful about ME ME ME ME for a minimum of four hours somewhere where you are a captive audience.) I did not stop caring, I still would help you, but at times I need help too. (I would be ashamed if I was 60+ and asking my broke college student kid for money when I was still working full time and able bodied, but that's just me. No judgment to you decent parents out there.) You were asked to help with bills, as you should. (What bills? I never received any nor were told about any.) We should be able to talk about that, and that is my expectation from any adult.

*She's hurting because I am rejecting her joint bank account, fine. But like. I don't need her money any more. Most parents would be proud of that and keep any personal feelings of nostalgia to themselves. Not be resentful that their kid has become independent.*

*AAAALLLLSOOO, she knows the vast majority of my income is scholarships and grants. Which as any of you familiar with college and the FAFSA and FERPA know, IT IS HIGHLY ILLEGAL TO SHARE THOSE FUNDS WITH ANYONE BUT THE STUDENT THEY WERE GIVEN TO. In other words, if she is hinting that I should have shared my large scholarship refund semester with her, she is fucking stupid. She used to work at a college for gods sake, though that didn't stop her from breaking FERPA to log into my account and snoop (before I educated myself on what FERPA meant).*

**Me**: Yes, you shared it with me, and that time is past. (I acknowledge you did the thing, there, that's all the validation your martyrdom gets.) I no longer want to be a joint user. Sounds like you should be happy that I no longer want to receive your money if it was a burden to you. (Eat your words, bitch. I am immune to guilt now.) 

It would be highly illegal for me to share any federal or state grants with you, as well as any scholarships. As a former [employee of college], you know better. Any [scholarship] refunds and pittance I earn covers out of pocket medical expenses, housing, and food. 

There will be no face to face talking if you refuse to remove me as a joint user. (Note I didn't promise that there would be if she does follow through. Just that there sure as heck won't be any before.)


The fucked up game of chess continues. 

****** 

I’ll be up for a bit doing studying, but I’ll update with live updates if any more stupidity rolls through. I think I may have stumped her for now. For all of edad’s whining to sibling that I haven’t been talking to him, he hasn’t texted me more than about two times in the past month or so. 

I’m hoping I learned from my past posts and from reading other people’s success stories. This shit is hard. It amps my adrenaline, gives me stomach cramps, makes me furious and agitated. I’m supposed to be trialling some new medications, but I am too amped from anxiety most days to take them (mostly from a fear of an allergic reaction, struggling to survive said reaction, and then navigating the costs of the ER care if said reaction occurs). I keep meaning to make an appointment with an EDMR therapist before it gets too close to the end of the coverage year, because I’ve read their methods can be very effective in people who have severe bodily stress symptoms from trauma and anxiety. I really do think my immune system thinks we are still stuck in survival mode 24/7 and that is why it’s so reactive to every little thing, even foods and smells and different kinds of water. I am trying my damnedest to cut these last strings so I can block them both for good and start to really heal and recover. I’m tired of my immune system being held hostage by their manipulation games. 

*******

As for now, my short term plan is to contact the student legal aid center to see what my legal options are regarding this stupid fucking joint bank account. If I have to sue War Dialer to get my name off, I sure as hell will, and I won’t pay a dime because I’ve paid into the student legal services fund. 

For those of you who weren’t present for my earlier posts, War Dialer made a bank account for me when I was a minor, once I was 18 I apparently signed on to be a joint holder (I definitely did NOT understand the implications), and now I can’t get myself removed because she’s the primary account holder. I can be removed from the checking and savings, but not the credit card attached, even though there’s no balance on the card. 

I explained my situation to the bank and they said as a joint holder, I could cancel all the cards WD got in the mail so that they’re invalid and she would have to go to a physical bank to order new ones (which she won’t do, and if she does, I’ll just keep cancelling them!) But otherwise they will not remove me as a joint holder without her signature. 

If I had just been put on as an authorized user, I could remove myself from the credit card and everything else. Seems pretty fucky that as a joint holder I am equally liable for debts on the account, but not equally allowed to take myself off of it???? Yeah I’m going to let student legal aid figure that one out for me. If it means serving my nparents, so be it. I would love to see the looks on their faces, even though I know WD would use it as a chance to pull teeth, suck up sweet martyr “woe is me my horrible child” supply, and demand “reasons” out of me in a court room. To which I would present my large log of texts and state I don’t need a reason to be taken off the account, the reason IS that I want it and that’s that. Advice welcome, of course. Relevant state is Ohio, land of people who flee the earth in flying machines. I’m pretty tempted to do so myself right now.

I am just beginning to realize how much I'm limited by my mind thinking deep down I don't deserve to be happy. I'll be brief, but I want to share some of my background so anyone who is like me can maybe give insight. Partly I want to let it out.

I'm 23, about to graduate from university. I grew up poor and have been poor most of my life, I'm the first to go to university and I'm close to finishing. I have been hit with random health problems (pituitary tumor, PCOS, and hair loss) this latter half of the year, so I'm taking an extra semester to graduate so I can have more time to find full time jobs. I've struggled a lot these past 6 years in college (had to take a semester off to work) and all I really want in this life is to provide for my mom and give her the means to enjoy her life. But I have such low confidence that employers will want me. I have worked really hard with what I've been given, and have had internships with prestigious companies, but have a low GPA. I know rationally I can get a job, but I find it so hard to believe. All of my life I've gotten through the death of my 2 dads to cancer, money issues, and struggling to keep up with the university lifestyle that my  imagination has been my escape. I've gotten by just being happy off my imagination of what my life could be like one day. When I see beautiful furniture (I'm an architecture major) I can't help but think how nice it must be to have it. Not, Oh, this would look nice in my home one day. More like, I can't have it or something. I also really want a car, I know it would help my life so much but it's hard to imagine. I am so used to not having things that I don't know if I deserve them. My friends are all starting their lives, and I can't help but feel stuck and still see everything as being so lofty, but with things that are attainable.

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend came to visit me yesterday and we were talking about what would happen if we won the lottery.  I was telling her I'd want to be an angel investor and set up scholarships for non traditional students and single moms and that I would not want to live above my means. And she told me, ""Kiramekki, you should definitely treat yourself. You've spent your entire life depriving yourself of things you want, 23 years and now it's time for it to pay off. I think it's ok for you to get what you deserve. You've worked so hard despite your circumstances and you're here now. What's not to say it won't keep working out for you? You deserve so much."" And it hit me that I really need to change my beliefs because they are wrong. I keep thinking it would be so nice to get a job that pays at least 50k/year but I'm so scared I won't get one. I just need help. I'm crying so much right now because I do want to be happy. I do want to have a car one day and travel with my mom. I want an actual relationship (I also suck in this department) I want so many things and I want to give so much but I'm really stuck by my mind and I don't know why.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm listening to subliminal affirmations and trying to find what I have deep down why I am this way, but it just makes me so so sad. I can't help but sob so much. I don't want this sadness to be negative energy or something. Any advice?"
9sjm1m,2,2018-10-29,"Me(24m) and my gf(23f) broke up and she wants to remain friends, and so do I but I dont know how to cope",ILIKECAPLOCK,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9sjm1m/me24m_and_my_gf23f_broke_up_and_she_wants_to/,"So me and my girlfriend met through mutual friends in college 4 years ago. We hit it off really well at first, however I was dating someone at the time. About 9 months later me and the girl I was seeing split up and 3 months after that I started talking to my girlfriend. We hit it off right away, we were both super attracted to each other, we loved the same things, and being with her was seamless. It felt just like I had a best friend who I just happened to be dating, she would look at me with this look and sometimes I would wonder if someone would ever love me that much again. Anyways about 6 months into our relationship we got a dog (I know a dumb idea for people our age) and they were my world. They were all I had in the way of family since I'm not entirely close to mine. 


We used to be able to see each other every day, I would drive to her apartment about 15 minutes away from mine and would stay there for days and vice versa. About a year into our relationship, the cost of living in Denver (all you Colorado folks know what I'm talking about) became too high for college students with minimal financial aid to continue living in. I moved in with my dad and she moved in with her mom. We only lived about 20 minutes apart and saw each other often but it was much different. Staying the night was a bigger task, since our parents were around and such. Sex became kind of difficult to fit in as often as we were doing it and so on. Anyways during this time I was going through a very rough financial time and had owed about $900 in debt I could not pay, and she offered to pay. It was the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me and quite frankly I was just shocked at how selfless someone could be.


And this is where things get rough... She was going through nursing school and I was going through a fairly rigorous internship at an investment firm. We lived stressful lives and it made things difficult. She had the tendancy to take her stress out on me and snap at me for minor things... like really often. But I understood and held my composure (or so I thought). In reality all I was doing was just distracting myself. Instead of paying the money back I bought a new gaming computer, I know I'm a fucking idiot. But at the time I thought nothing of it, and gave her a little bit of money and like new iMac as part of her payment, to which she seemed okay with.


 At this point I had noticed her acting different, and would ask her all the time what was wrong and if she was okay and each and every time she said she was okay. Now I should mention that all my life I had never seen what a healthy marriage looked like and my dad has said I love you maybe 5 times in my entire life... Essentially I have some intamacy issues I never realized I had. Meanwhile she would always bring me food, little gifts and just constantly do things for me. I thought it was the sweetest thing in the world. But at the time it never occurred to me to reciprocate that, like it just never popped into my head. This eventually stopped from her and I was lucky to get 3 texts from her throughout the day, I stopped seeing her except when we were trading the pupper off and on and she continued to deny anything was wrong.


I come to my breaking point and just ask her straight up to tell me if shes happy and she said no. And she proceeded to send me a text almost as long as this thread saying how she lost trust in me about the money (I dont not blame her at all for that, in fact I wouldn't blame her for never speaking to me based on that) and said how she felt let down by my lack of intimacy and making her feel appreciated. I felt guilty to the point of I could literally not eat for weeks it made me sick thinking of how I treated this person who loved me with all of their heart. Anyways, I give her some space and we try to work things out for about 6 months. During that time I express that I feel guilty for ruining the relationship but also frustrated she never came to me with how she felt, she was understanding and said she still loves me and is attracted to me but she just cant trust me in her heart. As of 5 weeks ago we decided to call it quits, not because I want to but because I need her to be happy. But man it fucking hurts....


I still love her but it's clear she is no longer *in* love with me and she wants to remain friends. And I want to remain friends too, but being around her is painful, and I'm not sure its something time will heal. I still go visit to see my pup but most of the time I cry in my car on my ride home. Do I keep trying, do I take a step back and come back later, do I try to win her back? I dont know what to do, I feel like a lost kid who just had their family stripped away. If anyone has been in a similar position or can give some insight I would be grateful.


Thanks guys


tl;dr: Girlfriend I've had for 3 years and I broke up, because I was neglectful and partially because she lacks communication skills. She seems content and wants to stay broken up even though she loves me, she just cant trust me. She wants to remain friends; as do I, but I'm just not sure I can see her and move on from her. But I'm conflicted because I want her in my life.

First time posting here. Recently I've started the internship at a research company. btw I am not statistics major.

Anyway, they asked me to research on 'number of registered vehicles by country' and I could not obtain latest data(2017year)

and as I try to find more sources, I've noticed numbers are soo different from each other even from so-call reliable sources. 

So I couldn't even decide what source to use. I feel even national organization's stats aren't so correct. I've almost lost faith in dtatistics. I think I will never be able to 100% believe in stats on the news, articles and reports anymore.

I've been thinking for a while about how to write this prompt, and I wanted to get it out there to see if I can connect with someone on it! I'm worried this will end up being too specific/exclusive for many people, so read the last paragraph if you feel that way!

If you read my post history, you'll see that I'm from Washington, DC. I'm really proud to call such a transient city home, and going to college this close to where I grew up was a great decision. Today, I want to find someone to write a story with who can help me make this amazing town a character, somewhere that feels as real as it is to me every day. I'm hoping to use specific places as settings, and have our characters behave like locals here do.

Because I'm so dedicated to the setting of the story, the plot is something I'm still undecided on. Are we lobbying interns meeting at our bosses' cocktail hour at the Watergate? Are you my intern coordinator, taking me to Eastern Market to socialize after work? Are we long-suffering Nats fans meeting at an open air bar before a game? Maybe you have another idea completely! I'm open to a lot of ideas, as long as we can set them somewhere that feels authentic to DC. We'll definitely discuss our plot and content before we start off.

**If you feel like this is too detailed about a place you've never been, no worries! I'd love to talk about any DPP prompt I've posted before.** Either way, send me a couple options for what you want me to look like so I know you read my whole prompt! Hope to hear from you!"
9sjucv,8,2018-10-29,Squidward’s Spermicide,ohlonelyme,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/9sjucv/squidwards_spermicide/,"I just want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn’t one.

I was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn’t paid of course, most internships aren’t, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would go crazy over it.

Now, since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I’ll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the SpongeBob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several months.

Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be “Fear of a Krabby Patty” and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn’t final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as “How sex doesn’t work” instead of “Rock-a-bye-Bivalve” when SpongeBob and Patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card “Squidward’s Spermicide” we didn’t think it more than a dirty joke.

One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Squidward practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear SpongeBob laughing outside and Squidward stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. SpongeBob says okay and goes to see Sandy with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward’s concert. This is when things began to seem off.

While playing, a few frames show the crowd shooting Squidward lustful looks; there are even a few fish who looked like they were flashing him. As he ends his performance, there is slight murmuring in the crowd before they begin to go absolutely wild, moaning in ecstasy. Not normal cartoon moaning that is common in the show, this was incredibly breathy, sexual moaning. Squidward’s in full frame and looks visibly aroused. The shot goes to the crowd, with SpongeBob in center frame, and he is giving what can only be described as bedroom eyes. It then switches back to Squidward, who has reached down and unzipped his pants. That isn’t the oddest thing, though. What is odd is Squidward had a hyper realistic cock. Very detailed, with every vein and inch of his big squid penis perfectly crafted. Clearly not shots of a real cock, but something a bit more real than CGI. Some of us looked at each other, obviously confused and mildly aroused, but since we weren’t the writers, we didn’t question its appeal to children yet. Looking back, that’s kind of fucked up when I think about it.

The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking down  at a naked Patrick with lust in his eyes. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn’t very long after the concert. The weird part is at this point there is only one sound: the sound of Squidward fapping. It’s as if someone in the room was masturbating vigorously, and as far as I know no one was at that point. He just stood there, masturbating vigorously for about 30 seconds, stroking his massive squiddy penis as Patrick raised up his ass, presenting a hyper realistic butthole to Squidward and all of us to see. He put his hands (tentacles) onto Patrick’s hips, and positioned his hyper realistic cock right near Patrick’s hyper realistic pink butthole.

The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his cock as it waits in front of Patrick’s butthole. By slow I mean it’s only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His stroking gets faster, more full of lust and sensuality. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The fapping gets slowly louder and more severe, as if someone was fapping right in our ears. The eerie part is this sound sounded real, as if the sound wasn’t coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound (and almost Squidward judging by his grunts) was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don’t purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality.

Below the sounds very faint, something sounded like laughing; it was coming from Patrick as he pushed his butthole back on to Squidward’s meaty calamari cock. After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced.

The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was insane. It was a still photo of a strapping young man. He couldn’t have been more than 24. He was lying in bed, completely naked and drenched in cum. His penis still seemed to be erect, and he had a look of pure ecstasy on his face.

The most bizarre part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. The thing is, the shadow looked strangely like Squidward’s, and in the bottom of the shot was a hyper realistic Squidward cock like in the rest of the episode. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the cum all over this man. We were of course distressingly aroused, but pressed on, hoping that there would be more like this.

The screen flipped back to Squidward, still grinding his cock against Patrick’s butthole. There was now what appeared to be precum oozing out of the tip of his penis. The precum was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you’d get the sticky fluid on your fingers. Squidward sounded as if he was close to cumming at this point. Patrick’s laughing lasted at longer intervals and coming more frequently as he pushed his ass down onto Squidward’s cock, letting his cephalopod meat enter his ass. After about 20 seconds of Patrick’s ass being pounded, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo.

The editor jumped at the chance to go back, we all were excited, we had to see this. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a young woman, no older than the first man. She was laying on her stomach, her legs raised  up and her back and feet drenched in a sticky white fluid. Her head was turned, showing off a sly, seductive look; she was clearly pleased to be covered in sticky man juice. Again the photographer’s shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to Swuidward, and there again was the hyper realistic cock. I sprung a massive boner at the sight and one intern, the only female in the room, reached down her pants and began furiously rubbing her clit. The show resumed.

About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Squidward  started to grip Patrick harder and thrust in at a faster pace. He pulled out his penis, and it zoomed out to show his whole body was now done in hyper realism. His cock was throbbing and pulsating. He gazed lustfully at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he turned back to Patrick, and with a mighty thrust went balls deep into his neighbor’s puckering anus.

Sweat was dripping down his face at a heavy rate. Squidward thrust deeper and deeper for a good ten seconds before finally busting a mighty load into Patrick’s asshole as the sea star giggled, and then a still photo appeared that lasted for a good 5 frames.

The animator was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a young person of unknown gender, about the same age as the girl before, but this time the scene was different. The person had a hyper realistic cock deep into their throat, their eyes closed in sheer pleasure. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn’t tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I ejaculated all over the floor, the animating and sound editors gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the cock slowly go in and out of the person’s mouth, their eyelids fluttering in joy as the meaty hyper realistic cock filled their mouth.

The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Hillenburg arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, it went back to the scene with Squidward and Patrick.  Squidward was lying in bed, smoking a cigar, as Patrick cuddled up next to him, for about 30 seconds. The shot quickly panned outside to a teeming mob of characters from the show, and they all cried out “LET’S DO IT” and we see in Squidward’s hands his hyper realistic cock, a hyper realistic Dreamworks smirk on his hyper realistic face. What follows was a good hour long sequence in which Squidward has hyper realistic sex with every single character on the show, male, female, and what have you. He penetrated every hole on Spongebob’s body; he rammed his cock up Mr. Krab’s ass as he flung dollar bills over his boss, eventually calling in Pearl for a threesome; he jacked it all over Plankton while Karen watched; he blew such an enormous load into Mrs. Puff’s mouth she inflated; he fucked Sandy in every hole one after the other in a lovingly detailed and hyper realistic sequence that went on for ten minutes; he put peanut butter on his balls and had Gary lick it off. It went on and on, with every character ever to appear up until that point on the show getting the hyper realistic squid dick inserted into one or more of their orifices Then the episode ends.

Mr. Hillenburg was absolutely blown away at this. He demanded to know who made this. Most people left the room at this point so they could clean themselves up, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me wet dreams for the next six years. God, I’m so glad I stayed.

The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don’t know what happened and to this day nobody does, which is a real shame because Hillenberg wanted to promote the person who made it for giving him the greatest spank material ever.

I never believed in unexplainable phenomena before, but now that I have something happen and can’t prove anything about it beyond anecdotal evidence, I think twice about things. I just wish I could show you guys this shit, because hot damn was this the sexiest shit I ever saw. I basically can’t even jack off to anything but Spongebob porn now, but none of it will ever be as good as this."

9sk7jv,3,2018-10-29,Should I take a pay cut to go big 4?,SoccerGuyFanatic,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9sk7jv/should_i_take_a_pay_cut_to_go_big_4/,"Hi guys.

I want to give some background on myself first... there is a TLDR...

I’m a CPA and a senior accountant in audit at a mid tier firm (think top 30) with about 3.5 years full time experience with 1.5 years of that being senior. (Also had internship but not counting that).

I work primarily on financial statement audits of state and local govt clients (cities and villages) and a few construction and manufacturing &amp; distribution clients with revenues topping out around $300 million. Also have experience working on NFPs. 

I have about 30 clients a year that I in-charge so busy season doesn’t really stop. Along with that we write all of our clients financial statements. By ‘we’ I mean ‘I’ write them. So I have gained pretty great exposure to a lot of challenging situations and I feel very comfortable with auditing and public accounting in general. 

Along with that, I spoke with my partner in-charge a few months ago about my progress. He said that I will for-sure be up for manager promotion summer 2020, but 2019 isn’t out of the question.

I’ve been thinking about what I want to do in the future and I came the the realization I don’t really want to work on govt for the rest of my career. Unfortunately, I’m starting to become more specialized in govt at my current firm and there really isn’t enough for profit work to go around for the whole year at my firm. So I’ve started to look elsewhere to see what other opportunities might present themselves. 

Today I interviewed with a big 4 in their FS team that promotes to senior after 3 years (guess which one). The partner gave me a call a few hours after the interview and said they wanted to extend me an offer, but they want to bring me in as an experienced hire. I don’t really have a problem coming in as experienced since I don’t have exposure to this industry, but I’m concerned after my discussion that this may come with a somewhat significant pay cut. Anywhere from $4k - $5k. They mentioned I would most likely be promoted after busy season in the summer. 

With all the time and effort I put in at my current firm, is it worth it to take a pay cut to go to big 4? I was actually hoping to get a pay increase to be honest ... 

I guess I was under the impression big 4 paid better than mid size....?

TLDR; senior auditor with 3.5 years of mid size firm audit experience primarily in govt auditing to possibly take $5k pay cut to go to big 4 FS. Am I dumb?

I just recently found this thread. I'm 24 and I've been strongly considering a career change. I got my bachelors degree is business admin with a minor in marketing (which is as broad as it gets) and am now kicking myself for not majoring in something more specific/employable and geared towards what I want to do. I am working at a full time job unrelated to my degree. I've found jobs very hard to get with almost no hard skills and I'm wanting to change that. I'm very interested in going back to get my computer science degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been browsing this sub for a bit, and it's been very helpful, so I figured I'd reach out. What are your honest thoughts on this program at WGU? Seems like it would be a great opportunity for me to get a degree at my own pace while working (which I would try to do quickly). My wife is considering WGU for getting her teaching degree, so we would just study together after work during the week and just grind it out in general for a year or so (or however long it takes). I don't really have any background in computer science, but have been researching career changes, and this is what I've landed on and seems to interest me a lot. I've been taking python courses on codeacademy and find it interesting, but still feel like I don't have a firm grasp on what computer science fully is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in the Seattle area, and have even thought about reaching out to tech companies partway through my studies to see if they have internships or any way I can get my foot in the door even on weekends just to learn more. What are your guys' honest reviews on the courses so far? As someone who has basically no knowledge in computer science, is it doable? Could I finish in a year (I know this question is related to how much time I put in so it's hard to answer)? Are the jobs fairly in demand/would a CS degree at WGU be valuable in the job market. From what I've read, this seems like the best option for a degree when you don't know exactly what you want to do within the field. 

&amp;#x200B;

We already have a little bit of student debt, so I would definitely want to find a job right away and start saving towards student loans. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!"

I posted this on /r/cscareerquestions, so no need to refer me there, but I'm starting to get extremely worried.

I'm a senior, majoring in computer science and looking for a software engineering new grad position, who's graduating next semester and I have yet to have an offer, and it's starting to take a toll on my emotions. The thing is that I know I'm not the worst candidate out there, I've had two internships my past two summers, and on my real reddit account, people said my resume was good, on the resume critiques (the only criticism was to make it easier for autoparsers to parse the data).

Even then, I struggle so hard to get interviews. I applied to close to 100 places and the only interviews I get are basically the ones that everyone gets for applying (Twitter, Amazon, Linkedin), and I can do the Hackerranks/coding assessments well, as in passing all test cases, but I still get rejected. I get really upset and jealous seeing how easy it is for everyone else I know, including the people here, get interviews easily, and seem to be comparing Big N offers, whereas I can't even get my foot in the door anywhere. At my school's career fair, I was the only person I know who got solved a company's technical question on the spot, and still not get an interview from it. Otherwise, I went 0/10 at my school's career fair in even getting interviews. I practice leetcode daily but what good is that if I can't even get an interview?

The only thing I have left for me is the final round for Amazon, but if I fail that, then I really don't know what I can do anymore. I don't even know if therapy would help, because therapy won't land me a job. And pressure from parents and seeing how peers seem to have it easy only makes my depression worse. It seems like nothing is working and I am starting to get overwhelmed with just how shitty everything is.

Can anyone lend a hand and help me out? If you know that where you work is looking for a new grad software engineer, could you let me know? I'm starting to get very desperate"
9sklnn,2,2018-10-30,30 yo Canadian. Think I’ve ruined my life (long text),K-donnager,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9sklnn/30_yo_canadian_think_ive_ruined_my_life_long_text/,"So having just turned 30 I’ve realized I’ve pretty much wasted my life. Burned all my bridges and squandered all my opportunities. I was a really artistically gifted as a kid but by end of grade 9 started hanging around losers who only lived to party.  This led to unhealthy interactions with immoral and damaged girls and I became obsessed with getting a girlfriend. I spent all my money from my jobs post-high-school on drinking. Many people do this but I feel like I should have held myself to a higher standard. 

I did however begin to increase confidence with approaching and talking to girls at bars, which positively boosted my self-esteem and made me more outgoing overall. I started to become more interested in video production and made a few short videos and a Halo machinima video-game movie) and eventually decided I wanted to pursue university in another city for it.

Unfortunately since my mom and dad never graduated high school they couldn’t offer any advice about taking on a student loan, so for 5 years I ended up spending very recklessly. I was completely invested in my studies at first, but wanting some form of a social life, I got in contact with a high school acquaintance who was attended University and began partying with him and his small clique almost every weekend. I still did great in my courses, but wasn’t taking the extra initiative to stand out. I was naive and thought of my classmates as only my friends rather than my competition. 

Under a bad recommendation from my friend I dropped from 5 to 4 classes. Because of this I wasn’t able to register for the advanced 3D class the following semester as my student credits were lower and I was put as last priority for course registration. As a result of this I never really was able to do any of the higher level core classes including After Effects, only these overly artistic and vague project based courses that never challenged my skills. 

I was too caught up in the party lifestyle and eventually started a fling with a bar-star girl. Was dumb enough to start dating her into the end of the 1st school year. 
That summer my mom killed herself.

Went back to school in the Fall and still carried enough charisma to maintain positive relationships with my peers (still in denial about my mom I think) but I became disillusioned and suddenly decided I was going to take a semester off to go backpacking in Europe. 

Racked up my credit card and spent the few thousand my mother had saved for me getting drunk across Italy, Spain, Czech Republic, and Germany. I met some really awesome people and had alot of fun but I screwed myself in the long run. 

When I returned to University the next fall I couldn’t properly reintegrate as my peers in my core classes were all now one stream ahead, and I couldn’t seem to make any new connections in the new stream. Eventually all my party friends graduated and I didn’t really have a social circle anymore. This led to becoming needy and trying to chase women too much to validate myself. I started going partying with acquaintances or classmates, which either led to me wandering off drunk and embarrassing myself, or the classmates making moves on me and starting false rumors when I’d turn them down.

By the summer realized I had to catch up so I stayed in my university town to take extra courses. I was getting depressed about being alone and becoming unsure of my degree but kept pushing forward. For the remainder of the summer I started worked at Home Depot. Started fooling around with too many coworkers. Started drinking too much again. 

Going into the next semester I was seeing a severely damaged girl who would drive drunk and found out her friend was getting her to do coke. Basically tried to distance myself after that but was way too invested in the drama instead of my classes. Ended up dropping a film class I was initially dying to get into my first year since I felt I had no peers to make good projects with and I was broke as hell and needed money. 

I started getting severely down on myself.  I remember my 4th year I was lying in my bed listening to Macklemore’s “Fallin” on repeat and realized this was the most depressed I’d been since high school. Iceberg in my chest, concrete in my arms and legs, feeling like burning poison in my veins. Forced myself to go to classes even though I felt I was losing it.

I would soon meet my long-term girlfriend. A cheery studious girl in the teaching program. She had her share of anxiety issues so we sort of bonded over the mental health thing, however we quickly developed a very unhealthy codependent relationship. 

She however did keep me strong in my last year of uni, and I finally was taking steps to get my shit together. I got my portfolio online with a website builder and started putting my name out for graphic and photography contracts on kijiji (never got anything though) I was thrilled to have landed myself an internship in my home city for my last semester, but a week before I’m suppose to start they call me up telling me they can’t afford a paid intern. I was crushed. I did find another internship with the recruitment department at the university, but it was kind of a joke. 2 months later the first company called me re-offering their internship but I let my ego get in the way and turned it down. 

Post graduation I moved back into my dads and my life since then has basically consisted of a series of odd-jobs and eventually getting my Emergency Medical Responder License. I was proud of myself briefly but it simply made zero sense. The only jobs you can get with EMR are industrial which is hours and hours up north away from home for weeks at a time, and both the client companies and your employer treat you like trash, since you only sit there alone until someone actually gets hurt. I’ve patched up a few guys who cut their hands but don’t think this job is healthy for someone who has a history of overthinking and depression as you’re isolated in a truck for 12 hours always dreading something fatal happening to someone, which is why I could never see myself pursuing my EMT/PCP.

I also finally lost my girlfriend after 5 years of periods of on and off dating. We had some great times together but we’d get in small bickering or she’s get mad for no reason. I got a knack for timing as I tried to move in with her right after her doctor had prescribed her with the antidepressant Escitalopram for her anxiety. She treated me terribly as it was like she had a complete personality shift (she was treating everyone in her life badly for a while) But I also felt she just got fed up since she had managed to put a down payment on a townhouse duplex and was frustrated that I couldn’t get my shit together to pull my weight in the relationship.

Now this very year everyone rushes to get married and I’m just going through all these key decisions that led to me being a failure. My social skills have basically died and I can barely hold my head up. I just want to get away and start over. I’m registered to take a TEFL course in the Czech Republic, and was going to sell all my possessions and car to move abroad, but after doing the research it seems like a terrible idea as its freelance working minimum wage for individual English lessons in an oversaturated market. Even if I was getting by, without anyone to really share the experience with I could see myself getting depressed and drinking too much again. 


My flight leaves in 2 weeks and I’m debating just cancelling it even though I don’t really have another plan. I figure I’ve wanted to do personal training for a while so maybe just do that since it’s the same pay but less risk. The responsible part of me however, says I need to go back to school to get a real career so I can eventually have a family, but I’m already close to Canada’s undergrad cap for student loans. I feel trapped. 

A lot of you may have zero sympathy since I’ve had all these opportunities, but while I’ve managed to keep my head above water, I have to some degree, always had depression and my mom passing away made it that much harder, until it started slowly making me crack and start making self-sabotaging decisions all the time. I feel that many people are distancing themselves from me since my life doesn’t make a hell of a lot of sense anymore. I tried to see a counsellor but I find them rather useless. Not suicidal yet but it just seems practical to not be around. I feel like I’ve lived a somewhat “full” life compared to most and there’s isn’t really anything left to look forward to now. Just a dead end street with years of becoming more lonely and isolated. 

If anyone has any input it would be appreciated. If not let it just serve as a warning to younger people to keep focused on your goal, stay away from drinking, and hold yourself to a higher standard.

I feel like I missed out on a lot of opportunities for friendships and great experiences in university (it's my final year now) and only as I am about to graduate, I begin to enjoy uni abit more. 

Here is my backstory -- I previously suffered from bad social anxiety and depression, but the lord delivered me from all that as I intensely sought Him in reading of the word for 6 months at an internship in ihopkc(international house of prayer Kansas city). (Seriously Thank God for this)

After that I matriculated into university. However, having freshly recovered from social anxiety, it is the first time I ever begin to make friends normally. Coupled with the new environment of university and the challenges already present to every college student, I basically spent my first 2 years friendless because I didn't click with anybody  from my school and I  did not know better to join an interest group or even a Christian group. I thought the problem was just with me. 

In year 3 I decided to break the  inertia and joined a christian group. I'm still in it now, though it was only after a year(this year) that I kind of got  more familiar with them. 

Also, I finally joined a dance club in my final semester and I'm beginning to enjoy it. But it's my final semester on campus and I feel like all the friendships I made are not nearly as solid enough for them to last when uni ends. 

I wish I had a good first 2 years of university to which I could look back and see what I have accomplished. 
But my first 2-3 years were like barren and I am most afraid I will graduate with a bunch of acquaintances and no true friend. 

What is it like after graduation? Do I get a clean slate when I start work? 

I know the word of God says for all the years the locusts have eaten, He will restore them back 7 times. But I don't know how that would happen, or if that would happen (yes I need to be stronger on my faith) 

Can anyone encourage me? :&lt;

Dear lovely Reddit people. I am new to Reddit, so if i make any mistakes in my post, I apologize.

So Here is my Case, I am a Danish student moving to Oostende here later this month, where I will do one of my many internships, this one will be for 6 months. I almost just finished another internship in another part of Belgium.

Now while I am during my internship in Oostende, I was hoping to have a part time Job, so I can save more money for my future internships, I am 23 years old and have a good bunch of experience as a waitress and normally it takes me a very short time to find a Job, however I know that since I am limited to English, it´´s going to be more tough when normally. So I hoped to come here to get some ""insider  knowledge""

My first thought was to get like a dishwasher job, cleaning job or something in that direction, I am really open for pretty much everything, I am just worried since Belgium for a start is not so keen on hiring an only speaking English people and since Oostende seems to be a beach/retirement town. As well as I can only work evenings and weekends.

So Really I am here asking for tips! I was thinking to print my CV and go in places and present myself. but is there Anything special I should look out for ? I really feel like I am having a hard time finding information on the topic.

Thank you so much for reading my post and do you have any advise, please share!"

9sm91l,3,2018-10-30,Computer science(Data science) SOP,vipul115,StatementOfPurpose,https://www.reddit.com/r/StatementOfPurpose/comments/9sm91l/computer_sciencedata_science_sop/,"Ever since my reminiscing can recall, computers have been the protagonist of my life. My interest in the subject has grown with each passing year, so much so that my mind inundates with ideas and questions which, at present, need a platform for expression. Despite an intensive study throughout my undergraduate in this field, I believe that there is an enormous proportion of the subject still in need of assimilation. Therefore, I aspire to take up an in-depth program in Computer Science at &lt;UNI_NAME&gt;. My current interests lie in textual data computation along with predictive and statistical analysis to collect valuable facts and insights from it. 

Right from the beginning of my Bachelors, I had the luxury to study math intensive coursework. In every one of my initial four semesters, I got acquainted with concepts such as multivariable calculus, continual integral transformations, elementary statistics, and probability theory. Additionally, I studied data structures which played a crucial role in laying the foundations for my current interests. I discerned how they affect data examination by optimizing the data retrieval times. This spurred the thought of what we could do with large amounts of data and how? Consequently, my curiosity steered me toward the field of analytics.

Promptly, I familiarised myself with data exploration libraries in python with an aim to address and analyze a problem that affected me directly. Upon finding an air quality dataset of my state on our government’s website, I started an exploratory project aiming to analyse the effectiveness of yearly government schemes to mitigate the rising pollution levels. My work delineated the proliferation of NO2 and CO2 levels in October and November due to excessive burning of crackers. Also, the graphs showed a drop of 5% in PM10 levels from previous years, which was close to the figure seen in the news. While this insight was not ground-breaking, I did feel a sense of achievement and acknowledged it as my baby steps into this field.  

The results of this project compelled me to explore further into this field. Being a part of today’s inquisitive youth, I fostered a burning intellectual curiosity of how lifeless frameworks could learn through data. I saw machine learning as a way of identifying the story data could tell. I started reading OReilly’s Hands on Machine Learning book and built strong theoretical foundations behind the most prominent predictive and optimization algorithms. I was also teaching myself web scraping during that time so that I could work on real and messy datasets. Soon, I began building projects so I could portray my skills to a potential future mentor, under whom I could learn more. 

I got selected for a winter Internship in 2017 where I worked under Dr SSG Guruprasad, a scientist at The Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory who unfortunately passed away during the last week of my internship. We developed a Parkinson disease detection model, a disorder with no specific diagnostic test, using GAIT data analysis and predictive modeling. My previous conversance with statistics helped me recognize univariate descriptive analysis as a means of scaling down our dataset and catch a sense of how it was distributed. Due to my mentor’s death, I kept working on the problem from home and drove it to completion. I presented the research paper along with my co-intern at the International Conference of Applied Computing and Engineering later in October 2018.
Unlike my previous personal project, this collaborative experience bore solid results that could potentially solve a real-life problem. It furthermore confirmed my penchant for this field and made me realize how much I loved investigating and applying theoretical knowledge to find solutions to actual problems. This was when I decided to get a masters degree in future, one that would aid me in getting the necessary mastery in the area enabling me to solve problems on a larger scale.

With that decision came a clearer vision of my long-term goals. Leading a team in the research department of a like-minded company is where I see myself in the future; a place where I can make informed decisions through data. To achieve that goal, I would require proficiency in the theoretical concepts at an advanced level, [describe which course will help].

I got introduced to Sentiment analysis while reading a paper which talked about usage of CNNs for sentence classification. It turned out to be extremely pertinent to my interests around then as it leveraged the concepts behind natural language processing for analytical purposes. I completed a side project quickly after where I mined information from social media platforms and measured the opinions of the public on any given topic.

I was also participating in multiple hackathons by that time, one in which I secured the second position with my team. It was a Fin-Tech hackathon where we built a loan advisory application for banks. The idea was to use regression techniques to recommend a loan amount to the bank’s customer based on his financial record.

In the summer of 2018, I interned at CivilCops, a social intelligence company where I developed an analytics engine and worked with their data science team on an intent classification model for their chatbots spread throughout social media platforms. The key takeaways from this experience were to understand the role pragmatics play in solving a problem dealing with textual data and getting hands-on experience with syntactical manipulation techniques used for corpus preparation. 

My interest in natural language processing stepped onto a different plane when my professor Mr. Hashmi suggested working on a text summarization as my capstone project. After building a two-layered bidirectional RNN with LSTMs on the input data and two layers, each with an LSTM, on target data, I’m now independently researching usage of attention mechanisms and how they can improve performances when dealing with longer texts. Conceptnet Numberbatch’s pre-trained word embeddings have been used for this project.

[Para for why this Uni]

All my past experiences have contributed to my intellectual development, and every step as an undergraduate has been taken by me keeping in mind my future endeavours. An upward trend in my GPA each year is reflective of how committed I’ve been to my objectives. Constantly stepping out of my comfort zone by taking advanced courses each semester, indulging myself in challenging technical projects which have shown concrete results, and the experience that I’ve gained from internships is what I believe has prepared me to take on the advanced practicum at &lt;College NAME&gt;."

They were happy and in love until a little under a year ago, ben loses his job. Nancy was doing an internship and was getting paid a really low income but all of a sudden she had to start paying for both of them for everything. Ben tried to get jobs but just nothing was happening for him. He then starts to get depressed and angry at life but takes it out on Nancy by blowing up at her for the smallest of things. At the beginning she was really considerate and loved him because she knew he was going through a tough time. But skip forward a year later and he still has no job, they are sharing her car (because he sold his) and Nancy is still supporting them both on a really small wage. Nancy and I have spoken about it, and she says she now has anxiety and sometimes can’t leave the house or even get out of bed she feels so anxious. I knew she was not happy but I thought that she still loved Ben and wouldn’t want to leave him so I never suggested it to her. But recently, she confessed that she is depressed, wants to leave Ben but he has said that he will kill himself if she does, so now Nancy feels she can’t do anything. What can I do as her friend to help her? I love her so much and just want the best for her because she’s already been through a lot in the last year. Has anyone else had this happen to them, or had a friend go through it? What did you do and what happened? Any advice will help! Nancy has not told me this herself, I have heard through our other best friend. She got drunk with Nancy a few weeks ago and Nancy spilled everything. Thanks in advance "

I told her I would really appreciate if they know because they are going to flirt with her. This guy used to text her the entire summer and I repeatedly told her that I would appreciate if she told them. She says they're just friends so I tell her what negative effect can happen and she said it can impact their friendship? The thing is, some other guy also asked her out and instead of telling him that she had someone already, she just said she was busy. I don't have a problem with her hanging out with guys but when they hang out alone and the guys don't know she's with someone, to me it feels like she is getting attention from other guys and letting them flirt with her.

All characters and scenes within are purely fictional.

- - -

Nobody really *expects* the unexpected. No matter what your daily routine is, the terms always seem to change on you. Wether it be finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground, meeting someone new for the first time, getting robbed in an alleyway... or getting caught up in a museum robbery between two international superheroes and a couple of terrorists. That’s always fun, right?

Totally not what I was expecting when I brought my little brother to the museum. Poor kid broke his arm on the school playground and wanted to go outside after mom practically jailed the kid in his room. Told him he needed to rest or it would never heal, and as inclined as I was to agree with her... well, the poor kid was miserable. What was I supposed to do, ditch him at home? Poor kid couldn’t even pick up a game controller to pass the time. It was horrible.

That’s why, on a sunny Autumn morning, I decided to take little Timmy to the Overwatch Memorial Museum. I figured he’d get his fill, run around, get yelled at for climbing on Rocketman’s rusty armor again, and we’d go home, right? Except, yeah. That whole thing about the unexpected and what-not. Glass shattered, bullets flew all over the place (except for the gorilla, who mostly swung his fists), and... well, that’s all I remember of the actual fight. I kinda spent the majority of it staring at purple and gold latex-clad butts, and then one of those butts started coming towards my hiding place, and *then* I panicked. Next thing I know, I’m putting on some antique mechanical fist and telling knockoff Spider-Girl to eat shit.

Well, I guess the one in the gold spandex (Tracer, I learned her name was, then Lena later on) kinda figured out where my eyes were the entire time, because when I emptied my pockets a week later for laundry day I found an interesting surprise in my pockets... and when I say *interesting,* I’m more or less saying *earth-shattering, rock-my-world, mind-blowing development,* because apparently during the fight— yes, *during,* I can see Winston in the background— she found time to duck into cover, take a picture of her bare tits, write down her number, and sneak it into my pocket. Of course I called right away. Or... well, right after a handful of panic attacks and acting out a couple of worst-case scenarios in my head. But I did call!

I wish I could tell you the exact conversation. Word for word, each breathy, teasing syllable. Unfortunately, I was too busy trying to keep myself from falling apart to focus on much of the conversation. In all fairness, I probably sounded like a complete tool. Just a lot of bubbly-sounding ‘uh-huh’ and ‘yep’ noises. But out of the entire conversation, I remember two things: the address she told me to meet her at, and the cutesy kissing noise she made at the end. And, no, you don’t get the address.

After that, the next nine months kind of blur. We fucked on a regular basis, sometimes as equal, sometimes as a sub and dom. A couple months after that, we started going on actual dates. I learned she was in town on a terror watch, and that Lena had a girlfriend back in London (who she swore up and down was cool with her having another boyfriend). She learned a lot about... well, school. I don’t think I’m super interesting, but she very *passionately* disagreed.

Just as fast as she came, she left. That’s the one thing I really remember the clearest. March sixteenth, Lena said she had important business and would get in touch soon. I figured that would mean a few days, or maybe weeks. By the time the last week of school rolled around, I was starting to panic. Did she find someone else? She certainly didn’t seem super loyal to her girl in London. Was I just tripping balls or something the whole time? *Was my life naught but a lie, plugged in to the matrix as my body was drained to power a mechanized race?*

Apparently not. Just as I was about to spiral into tinfoil hat conspiracies in my school desk, I got an email from an address I’d never seen before. “oxtonfree69@overwatch.net.” Of course I opened it in a heartbeat, and I closed it just as fast when tits flashed across my screen. Once I got over that scare and made it to the bathroom, I opened it a second time. Inside were three things: A picture of Lena, knuckles deep in her cunt, a two way ticket to Switzerland, and a long letter that began, “Congratulations on your acceptance into the Overwatch Internship Program...”

- - -

So, just shy of ten paragraphs condensed into a small synopsis: Lena gave Brian (the kid in the blue hoodie) her phone number. Booty calls turned into an actual relationship between the fifteen year old kid and the twenty-six year old woman. After dropping off the map for a couple months, she resurfaces in Switzerland for the reformation of OW, offering Brian an internship for the summer where he builds up a harem of Overwatch women.

I would play Brian in this game. He’s fifteen years old (we can go younger if you want), neck-deep in horny teenager hormones, and can’t believe his luck. You would play the various women of Overwatch, as well as the world around them.

I have no limits, but I’ll respect yours.

My kinks are toiletplay, transformation, vomit, bestiality, cheating, futa, traps, hairy pubes/pits, petplay, impreg/pregnancy/birth, costumes, latex, bondage, loli/shota, sadomasochism, non-permanent snuff and gore (Read: Mercy is a healslut), toys, exhibitionism, drugs, voyeurism, choking, cross dressing, and chastity.

9spo3v,272,2018-10-30,A little victory [Well-being],Altare21,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/9spo3v/a_little_victory_wellbeing/,"I pride myself on being a great doctor, but I want to let you guys in on a little secret. I made it to almost halfway through intern year without ever suturing before, because I was scared. You read that right. When I type it out it seems so stupid, and yet it’s easily my greatest shame in medicine. How did I develop such an irrational fear over such a simple thing?

This ridiculous saga started early on in my third year. At this point I was still gunning for surgery (now a budding basement-dweller), and I was determined to crush that rotation. Before it even started, I practiced suturing and knot tying on whatever I could get my hands on for hours at a time. I got pretty good and felt confident I’d be able to handle whatever they asked me to do. My first week on trauma, a guy came in with a deep neck laceration. We took him to the OR for wound exploration and it turns out the blade missed any critical structures. The cut itself was also pretty clean, so it ended up being a good opportunity for the medical student to close with some simple interrupted sutures. Great! My time to shine, right? I stepped into the field, loaded up my needle driver, annnnndd – I completely froze up. To this day I have no idea how or why I had blanked on something I had felt so prepared and excited for. The trauma fellow looked at me like I was the dumbest person in the room, and I sure felt like it. He took over and berated me for failing such a simple task. After that incident, I developed an irrational mental block around suturing and avoided it like the plague. Somehow it worked, and over the next couple years I never sutured once.

I knew I’d have to learn eventually though, and that bothered me for the longest time until everything came to a head last night. I was getting close to the end of my ER shift when an attending comes in who I hadn’t worked with before. Now, most of the attendings know I’m going into radiology and are perfectly okay with me cherry-picking my patients. I try to see people who might have interesting imaging findings, so I’d been avoiding the psych patients, the drug seekers, and the like. I could tell this new attending was more old-school when he told me to see patients I wouldn’t normally see. That’s fine. I’ll see whoever, it’s my job after all. Well, it *was* fine until I saw a patient with an arm laceration pop up on the screen. He asked me to see her and my heart sank a little, now faced with having to confront this irrational fear of mine. I mustered up the courage to tell him that I, somehow an actual doctor, didn’t know how to suture as I had never done it before, and that I would feel uncomfortable seeing that patient. I expected the same look and verbal beating I got from that trauma fellow all those years back, but it never came. Instead, he told me in a measured tone that now was the time to be uncomfortable. He reassured me that he wouldn’t let me fuck it up and told me to meet him in the patient’s room. I wasn’t reassured. I figured I was about to mangle this poor girl’s arm, but I put those thoughts aside and just went with it. He took the time to teach me every step, and thankfully the patient had a good laugh at the whole situation which put me more at ease. He did the first one, watched me do the second one, and then left while I finished the rest. When he came back he saw my work and said I did an excellent job. And just like that, the switch flipped. It felt like that first episode of Scrubs where Dr. Cox pushes J.D. to put in a chest tube on a crashing patient, when just a little earlier he was too scared to even place an IV. Just like J.D., my attending forced me out of my comfort zone and I came out the other side with this ridiculous, irrational weight off my shoulders. I can’t wait to suture again.

A lot of you might be thinking, “Who cares? That shit is trivial”, and maybe you’re right. But medicine is hard, and I think it can be hard in different ways for different people. I posted this because it’s been one of the few genuine reflections I’ve had since starting this whole process, and I wanted to share for anyone who might be similarly struggling with something that seems to come so easy to others.

Vor etwas mehr als 2 Monaten habe ich meine selbstgenutzte Eigentumswohnung im nördlichen Ruhrgebiet verkauft. Gekauft hatte ich diese als meine Karriereoptionen noch eeeeetwas besser waren als heute und vor allem weil sie billig war. Nun folgte dank jahrelange psychischer Zermürbung nachdem ich mich mit meinem Standortleiter verkracht hatte, im Juli letzten Jahres, endlich die Trennung von meinem Arbeitgeber. Ich wurde freigestellt für meine gesamte Kündigungsfrist und konnte so in Ruhe auf 450€ Basis jobben und einen neuen Arbeitgeber suchen - wurde dann mein 450€ Arbeitgeber. Neue Rechte Hand der Betriebsleitung, super Arbeitsklima, super Arbeitszeiten, okayische Bezahlung. Der Haken: Scheiß Arbeitsweg. Keine echte Verbindung mit Bus und Bahn und sowohl morgens als auch Abends scheiße viel Verkehr. Also was tun? Neue Wohnung und die alte loswerden.

Hat geklappt - sogar mit gutem Plus

Also Wohnungssuche. Vor ~7 Wochen habe ich angefangen ernsthaft zu suchen. Mittlerweile ist der Verkauf Rechtskräftig und ich bin 2 Wochen vor Schlüsselübergabe mehrere hundert Euro an Spritkosten ärmer, habe 50+ Vermieter angeschrieben, zwei Dutzend Wohnungen besichtigt und hätte viele davon auch gerne genommen.

Die Highlights aus meiner Sicht waren die folgenden:

Geile Wohnung Nummer 1: Super Lage, endlich mit dem Fahrrad zur Arbeit, bisschen alte Küche, dafür gibts die billig dazu. Die Vermieter sagten mir gleich das die Wohnung ein Abschreibungsobjekt ist und die letzten Jahre als Pendlerwohnung an eine BMW Niederlassung vermietet war (Damit man die Pendlerpauschale schön voll nutzen kann während man nur 2km Arbeitsweg hat). Da ist die Wohnung dann auch wieder hingegangen weil die sich doch nochmal gemeldet haben...

Geile Wohnung Nummer 2: Nachmieter gesucht. Ich stelle mich vor - man versteht sich, man teilt Humor. Ich will nicht mit Möbeln umziehen, er will seinen Kram da lassen gegen gutes Geld. Ich bin finanzkräftig und sein Favorit. Er sichert mir zu das meine ""Konkurrenz"" von ihm handverlesen wird, damit ich die Wohnung bekomme.  Die Wohnung geht an einen Studenten ohne Nebenjob oder Bürgschaft - der die meisten Möbel weder haben will noch bezahlen kann...

Geile Wohnung Nummer 3: Wieder Nachmieter blabla. Man einigt sich wieder  blabla - höre Tagelang nichts. ""Ach die Wohnung war schon weg. Hab ich verpeilt"" BITTE WAS?

Wohnungen 4 und 5 werden ""Intern"" vermietet jeweils am Tag an dem ich die Besichtigung habe. Abgesagt hat mir natürlich werder Mieter A noch Mieterin B. Und wieder 200km mehr auf der Uhr für dumme Nüsse

Geile Wohnung Nummer 6: Die abgehobene Studentin in dem Altbau mit der sanierten Wohnung. Etwas teuer, etwas alT, aber würd ich nehmen. Sie will 1500€ für IKEA Möbel die das nichtmal neu gekostet haben... Weißte Watt? Egal! Nehm ich trotzdem!
Bleibt natürlich auch in studentischer Hand.

Nummer 7 vermietet der betagte Vermieter lieber an die junge Dame mit dem tiefen Ausschnitt die keine zwei geraden Sätze sprechen wollte (Assi-Deutsch) und gleichzeitig mit mir da war. Wer braucht schon Charisma wenn Frau Titten hat?

Doch lieber /r/de ler seit Freitag bin ich ein gebrochener Mann. Ich besichtige #8 der Wohnungen die ich ungesehen nehmen würde. Die Vermieterin ist Nett, hat Humor, kommt aus der Ecke in der ich meine Jugend verbracht habe - man versteht sich, man einigt sich. Sie warnt mich vor das vor mir ein älterer Herr da war der ein besseres Angebot hatte. Sollte der sich nochmal melden... blablabla Natürlich bekomme ich sie nicht.

I was one of the few who went out of state for school and am in my last year of school in Connecticut for Accounting. I've had a lot of opportunities here since I am near Hartford, the insurance capital of country and all of the Big Four Accounting firms with offices here. With great paying internships at Accounting &amp; Insurance firms and a good starting salary once I get my 150 credit hours to sit for the CPA. 

Recently I have been missing Maine a lot more than I have during my past years at school, looking up accounting jobs and even grad school. My friends who stayed in Maine are happy living simply but the jobs they have or money they are making are not up to my standard, especially now that I have grown accustomed to Connecticut wages. I understand there is a difference in cost of living between these two states but I feel like there are really a lack of career opportunities in Maine. 

I am wondering if I have not done the proper research and if there are opportunities, some good corporations in Maine that I would be able to find a good paying job with room to move up? I would love more than anything to move back to Maine (certainly not Northern Maine) and start a family in the state I grew up in. My boyfriend is also an accountant so we both need competitive salaries and numerous options. Is there any sign of an economic boost in the next few years?

Would love any insight!"
9sqhja,5,2018-10-30,Recommended to move it here.,ScarletSunder,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/9sqhja/recommended_to_move_it_here/,"Posted originally on JustnoMIL: So if anyone has seen my (super long post ) from a few weeks ago you know my boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years. Well cause his parents have basically done everything to stunt his and his sister growing up he has no car, and a job that does not pay him. Fast forward to this weekend.

So I asked him if he could come down this weekend so we could celebrate his birthday early. My mom has season tickets for all college football home games at my school since she’s an alumni and the next one happens to fall on his birthday weekend. So he comes down and keep in mind they’ve not helped him get a car yet. First it was a mustang that he had to work to pay off improvements well then insurance was too high so they’d fix up this Volvo at his dads work but that keeps having issues. So back to the mustang but the convertible top isn’t working so that’s another stall. Well his ex step dad drives him down. After forgetting he was gonna bring him he asks me to meet him half way (I live  an hour and half away and the area they wanted to meet has three major exits) with no location given like a restaurant and I was told at 5 pm when I can’t see to drive well in the dark. So his dad drives all the way. Well bf has been working at his dads shop he is a manager at (shop got new owners and are running the franchise into ground like cutting employees pay without discussing with them).  His been working there since May old owner had an agreement that he could work off books and he’d help pay for big college. New owners didn’t follow thru so got 4 months of free labor. Finally got him on payroll in late August early September expect then they only did direct deposit. So boyfriend had to sort that out and still has not been paid. So his looking else where finally. 

Well I try my best to give him a peaceful visit we go to the zoo ( he loves the zoo), feed giraffes, and go on a ghost tour since he loves ghost hunting. Come Sunday my church hosts ocktoberfest every year. Every year I look forward to it but it’s always far away so I leave early. This year I had time to spend the entire time. But his dad after we told him we are leaving in 10 minutes for the church texts us after I had started drinking he was leaving the house. So I said we aren’t gonna be leaving till almost 5 so his gonna have to wait. ( also his dad forgot he was in my city and he needed to pick him up). So he gets him and all after making him a wreck like normal.

Then I talk to my mom who has been trying to break us up since we started dating saying it’s puppy love. Yeah he has a crappy life while I don’t. He also has no moral support but me and has thought of suicide (I’m not positive if he is being dramatics not. He has enough issues for him to not be so I try to push crisis centers and such), I also don’t really want anyone else. I want different traits but I knew going in he has Autism and what that means on his social ability. Just between his just no family and my helicopter mom 🤦‍♀️. I’m an only child with divorced parents from a young age. So mom has always been I don’t want you to waste your youth like I did. His parents always seem to be wrapped in their own lives and less their children. 

I could write a soap opera on his life since I’ve known him. And sorry on mobile and it’s super long again. If your wondering why he doesn’t just find a place to walk to work. His dad has moved to a rental far from anywhere to easily walk. And his mom does live near several places his looking at applying at. But they make both him and his sister (she’s now in high school) flip houses since they divorced when we graduated high school. 



Edit: I had a miscommunication yesterday with a commenter. At this time I currently am the only one who watches out for his mental health. Pushed him to seek counseling on campus and call crisis centers if needed. He needs so much more then that. Only so much I can do over the phone. He started applying to new jobs today (finally!). I’ve told him when it’s only  my money paying for the apartment he can move in (currently dad is helping as I go to grad school,TA,and intern). "

9srksv,1,2018-10-30,"Failed web development student, failure at life...",Failingdude,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9srksv/failed_web_development_student_failure_at_life/,"Hello all, I'm a 20 year old guy and I am a failure at life. I'm currently a second semester sophomore at college (I graduated high school a semester early and went straight into college), and I'm probably going to fail out this semester. I'm currently on academic probation, and I seriously doubt I'll get my grades up enough to stay in. I'm studying web development (name of degree is Media Arts and Science) and I can't understand any coding other than basic html and css. I completely fail at trying to understand javascript, which is one of the most basic back end languages if I understand correctly. My dead grandfather who I never knew payed for my college through a trust fund, so at least if I drop out I won't have to worry about pointless debt or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Supposedly I could come back after being out a semester (supposedly, I don't really know how the academic readmission process works), but what then? If I'm not able to understand this shit now, why would I be able to understand it then? They say insanity is doing the same shit over and over again and expecting things to change, so I don't even know if coming back would be a good idea if I (and I probably will) fail out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hell, all I want is to be able to get a decent paying job so that I can build some sort of life for myself away from my critical mom (parents are divorced, I mostly live with her when not in my dorm). If I can't get that, then I honestly truly think I should just kill myself. I know failing out of college isn't the end of life, but I just don't think there will be any path out there to get myself financially independent. So what is life then? Would I just end up working fast food while still living with my mom?

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all this, I'm a failure in a lot of other ways too. I don't have a drivers license, never had a girlfriend, and I haven't had even a basic job ever since my senior year of high school ( I worked for minimum wage at a Little Caesars). My mom constantly tells me what a failure I am and that I need a job/ to do internships at my college. Except my GPA is too low for internships. I've tried to get a job in the past few years, without luck so I'm honestly pretty discouraged at this point. Obviously I will put in a lot more effort into that area if I fail out, since if I'm no longer going to college I would be doing literally nothing with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. Even if I manage to not get kicked out this semester, I'm definitely going to get fucked by my classes in the next one. And if I do fail out, I see no path to me ever gaining financial independence. So I honestly am starting to view suicide as more and more of an option. Am I missing something? Is there some way I can actually not be a complete failure and end up with a decent paying job?"
9srmxz,2,2018-10-30,Searching for an internship,ey38,askswitzerland,https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/9srmxz/searching_for_an_internship/,"Hello people that are interested in Switzerland

I would like to tell you something. First things first. My English isn't that good so I can make horrible mistakes. Excuse me for that. 

So beginning with who I am and what I do. I live in the Netherlands. I'm a Network Engineer student. I'm in my second year. For this year I have to do internship for a total of 6 months. 


Before the summer vacation I found a company where I could be an intern. I worked there for 3 months. But the 3 months were like nothing. The boss didn't care about me. He just gave some exercises to do which he expected me to finish what was not achievable. So he got pissed off and decided to fire me today. 


Now I'm stuck and searching for an internship as a Network Engineer. I have to do intership till the end of January so that's another 3 months from now. I thought the whole day about where I can do my internship. Then it came up in my mind that my school gives me the possibility to do internship overseas. 


So I thought why not do it in a different country. Because I'm very interested in Switzerland, I want to do my internship preferably in the German part of the beautiful country because Dutch is kind of similar to it. If I had to choose a city I would go for Basel. But anywhere else is fine if the circumstances are good. 

But the problem is that I don't know where to start and where to look. So I decided to post this on Reddit. Maybe there is someone that can help me. I would really appreciate it if you can suggest me some companies or places. 

Remember that I have bills to pay if I decide to do my internship there. For example paying rent for where I stay. I wouldn't mind sharing a room with another student and dividing the bill. 


So I ask you all dearly to recommend me some places and companies I can look for. And also how I should apply and what not. Any other tip will also be appreciated :)

For your information, I don't speak German unfortunately. I can speak Dutch, English and Turkish.

Feel free to message me about it. Thank you in advance!"

Dealing with that and the rampant abuse at home, I was pathetically desperate for attention/wanting to feel like I mattered to someone.

This is where **R** comes in. He was the same age as my sister, she was still alive then, and supposedly he was good friends with her so I thought I could trust him. *I WAS SO FUCKING WRONG.*

 - He tried to pressure me into either sending him nudes/give him my virginity more times than I can count

 - He revealed that he was using me to get close to my sister cause he was more or less obsessed with her. When I flipped out he called me a ""stupid little girl"" and that I only have myself to blame for the situation.

 - Despite actually having a **GIRLFRIEND** of his own, that clearly didn't stop him from trying to get in my pants.

 - My sister saw him as a creep as he blatantly hit on her several times despite warning him that she's already taken and I didn't initially listen to her when she told me to cease contact with him.

 - He called me ""clingy"" and ""too much to handle"" but he'd get pissed if I acted formal(?) with him?? He'd even go as far as asking if I missed him *(he joined the Marines)*. When I'd say no, he acted like an inconsolable brat.

 Why I allowed that so-called friendship to continue for at least a year(?), I don't know. I wanted to matter to someone, I wanted to be useful....just so many shitty excuses that even after all these years I still feel gross for playing his mind games.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when he demanded I send him nudes of **MY OWN SISTER** and I realized then I had to stop talking to him for good. After ghosting him for one week, I told my sister (almost) everything and how she had a right to tell me off but she ended up blaming herself for the whole situation.

The result? We started to treat each other better as sisters and we never heard from **R** again, thank God.

Well, its been 3 years now since my sister passed and while therapy has helped, I can't find the strength to put myself out there socially until I get my mental health in check. My narcissistic father constantly shits on my lack of trying for not having any friends or even a boyfriend. I will admit I'm terrified that I'll deal with someone else like **R** again.

Well, today at my internship I check my student email and what shows up in my inbox? An email from **R** asking/looking for me. How in the flying hell he found my student email is beyond my comprehension but I immediately deleted it. My Discord group is being very supportive but I had a small panic attack. 

This is supposed to be a good week for me (applying for graduation, new job with the city = no more dead-end retail) but this happens. To anyone who's dealt with this nightmare, what did you do? Even if he has changed for the better, which I *seriously* doubt, I **CANNOT** allow myself to get sucked back into his crap. I just can't. It'd be a huge shitstain on the progress I've made and in my sister's memory. 

*EDIT:* To also add, his ex-gf hasn't touched her FB from **2014** at the latest, so I can only hope she broke up with his cheating, scumbag self. What happened to her or where she is now....I have no clue. 

**tl;dr:** So-called friend from my past took advantage of me when I was in high school so I ghosted him. After all this time, he's apparently found me and I'm actually scared."

I’ll try to make a long story short: I’m a 23 and I never had a serious relationship or even dated a guy for more than a couple of times. Thing is: when I was younger I used to think that I was different, stupid and not pretty enough. I ended up being a confident 23 year old woman. I graduated in business and economics from one of the best business schools, while studying I’ve opened a startup, did two internships, did my exchange semester. Ive graduated last year and now it’s one year that I’m working in consulting where I’m having a great career. I work really hard, I’m motivated and everything. I’ve always been told that I’m good looking, I regularly work out, I’m in a great shape right now! I take care of myself. I go out with my friends, I try to meet new people everyday (I’m extrovert), I have a great family that I love. Now, thing is that I’ve always been so focused on achieving my goals, and I’ve understood that kids of my age actually have a different life from mine, but still, I’m really trying since I was 16 to be a better me, to be kind, not to be jealous, and so on.. now I feel so hopeless and I really can’t understand what is wrong with me.
What should I do? My friends say that sometimes I can be intimidating, that I’m too “too much” in everything I do, that I’ll meet the most amazing guy someday, that I have to be patient. Now it’s years of being patient and I’m getting worried. Should I see a therapist (I used to when I was 18)

However, I'm scared this isn't enough (mostly compared to other pre-meds at my school.) My advisor is no help and won't give me a straight answer as to what I'm lacking. I'm not involved in any clubs on campus because I commute to school and it's tough having to drive back and forth (plus traffic is horrible where I live, takes me an hour just to get to school sometimes) and I'm not interested in research at all.

9stay1,56,2018-10-30,Natsuki vs the Vending Machine,AphoticAmaranth,DDLC,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/9stay1/natsuki_vs_the_vending_machine/,"Natsuki had just eaten her 420th protein bar that day, but she was still hungry. She turned to look at Monika with pleading eyes, waiting for another snack. Much to her dismay, however, Monika only shook her head and sighed. “Sorry Natsuki. That was my last protein bar.”

“Fine! I-It’s not like I specifically wanted *your* protein bars, dummy! I’ll just buy some myself…” Natsuki pouts. She grabs her purse and opens it, only to find that it was completely empty. “Hey Sayori! Lend me some money, will you?”

Sayori nervously retrieves her coin purse. She fumbles with the latch and gets it open. Then, she turns it upside-down and lets its contents spill onto the desk. Only two small coins fall out.

Currently, Natsuki has found **2** nickels inside Sayori’s purse, and now has a total of **$0.10!**

Unfortunately, that's not enough for a protein bar. Each bar costs $0.99. Maybe one day, they'll finally have enough nickels to buy one! 

“Why don’t you go look for coins under the vending machine?” Yuri suggests.

“Yeah! Let’s go!” Sayori exclaims. Sayori holds Natsuki’s hand, and drags her out of the clubroom before she could object. “Adventure time!”

Soon, the duo reach their destination: the vending machine. An artifact shrouded in mystery, it was believed that if you offered it a few coins as a sacrifice, a snack would drop from above into its metallic maw, free for the taking. Many an adventurer have attempted to visit the vending machine, only to encounter the cruel fate of dropping their coins beneath it. But it was there, in the unexplored abyss under the vending machine, that our heroines would find untold fortunes!

Natsuki lies low, trying to look for coins. Finally, she notices one. She puts her hand under the vending machine, trying to reach for it… “AAAAAAAA! A spider! … Just kidding. I can’t reach the coin though, help me, Sayori!”

Sayori pulls out a rope and ties it into a lasso, using it to pull out stuff from under the vending machine.

“Eww! A spider!”

“Eww! A slimy pen!”

“Aha… Aww, a couple of dollars? I wanted a protein bar!” Sayori grumbles.

“Dummy! Those dollars can buy two protein bars!” Natsuki retorts.

“What?! Explain how!”

“Money can be exchanged for goods and services.”

Natsuki takes the coins and inserts them into the vending machine, buying two protein bars. She hands one to Sayori, and starts eating her own. Sayori goes behind Natsuki, then wraps her arms around her.

“Ah- Jeez… I get it, I get it…”

Sayori suddenly leans down and takes a bite out of Natsuki's protein bar.

“H-Hey!! Did you seriously just do that?!”

Their antics are interrupted by a thunderous roar from the vending machine. The vending machine dissolves and contorts into weird shapes, before finally taking on the appearance of a metallic dragon. It towered over the heroines, and glared at them menacingly. “Who dares to steal from my hoard of coins!!”

“Who, you ask?” Sayori is the first to speak up. “A hero… of justice!” She retrieves a long rope from her pocket, and swings it around wildly, whipping the dragon with it. A few moments later, however, she started to get dizzy, and hurt herself in her confusion. She spinned around while advancing on the dragon, only to end up wrapped in rope. Oops.

Natsuki is the next to act. “Square up, thot!” she declares, as she runs forward and falcon punches the dragon. It’s not very effective… “Oof! My fist hurts.”

The dragon roars, and raises a claw to swing at Natsuki. Before the hit connects, however, the dragon is interrupted by a barrage of knives flying over Natsuki’s head, barely missing Natsuki by a hair’s breadth. It recoils in pain, and takes a few steps backwards. “A wild Yuri has appeared!” Yuri announces her arrival from behind Natsuki.

“Yuri! Thanks for the assist! But i-it’s not like I needed that, anyway! I’m the best, after all… Hey, why are you just standing there? Help me out, dummy!” 

“No can do.” Yuri states matter-of-factly. “It’s not yet my turn.”

Suddenly, all the lights in the cafeteria went out. The only thing visible was the dragon, whose eyes now had a crimson glow. “I’m chargin’ mah lazor!” it bellows with a resounding shout.

The party trembled in fear at this hopeless situation. Is this how it all ends?

“Hewwo!~” A high pitched voice interrupts them. “Are you in twouble? Don’t worry, I’m here! I’ll dewete the enemies~”

The party turns to face the new arrival. It was a humanoid creature with luscious brown fur, dressed in Monika’s school uniform and signature white ribbon. “Hi, I’m Fluffnika!”

“Please just delete me.” Natsuki groans, as she collapses and loses consciousness.

…

Meanwhile, in a dark and dilapidated lair, which was so dark because the owner forgot to pay the electricity bill, an old man paces around the room while furiously yelling at his newest intern. “God damn it, MC, are you dense?! How many times must I repeat myself?! Deliver the protein bars to the cafeteria, and the weed to the dark alley! Not the other way around! Do I make myself clear?!”"

Interestingly there's a lot of propaganda around how there's a shortage on manpower, while at the same time people having difficulty finding jobs. There are notable instances of similar experiences, political opponents' family members getting fired for no reason, etc. My father did a big disservice to the local Fidesz by being a key figure against the prison project (which was going to be built by a company very well known for overpriced projects), my grandfather is a well known tankie (who's so racist he's often accidentally agrees with both Fidesz and Jobbik), not to mention I had a lot of bullies in secondary school who thought I was severely mentally disabled (long story short: I had some speech issues I've since overcome for the most part, but thanks to the Hungarian R-word I got some serious shit, such as being accused with my mother taking up huge benefit money which she spends on shoes and jewelry, which leads them having to pay a lot of taxes on their motorcycles, game consoles, phones, etc) and probably wanted to take their revenge this way (which is ironic, because the hard time I had financially radicalized me from an actual centrist to a radical leftist).

My father is seriously thinking on kicking me out to the streets if I won't pay, which makes me to go back to my mother, and my abusive stepfather who cannot accept my autistic quirks, implying if I can go back to them and my stepfather will let it all go through. 

I unfortunately cannot just pick up any job I could. I'm physically weak, thank's to the ""ergonomics are luxury"" policy of Hungary my back is all busted meaning it wouldn't be very feasible to get on the average level, which also hard due to how Hungary sees sports (they think it's completely interchangeable with other physical activities such as wood chopping which I can't do) and the local food culture (very high in calories). Due to my autism I'm very bad with people, have very little job experience because I couldn't find anything, and I have no qualifications besides my unfinished software engineering degree which is in danger because I'm unable to find internship. I get a lot of harassment from my family because of it: They think I'm a know-it-all computer guy, who can find a job anywhere as a computer repair-man, my father tried to get me a network engineering job once (all I know is how to set up a router and troubleshoot common network errors), and I'm always being told I should get a CNC programmer job. I haven't focused on web development because it paid way less and required me to learn more languages, so I put all my effort into software optimizaton and languages like C, C++, C#, D, and Java instead."

Secret Stuff: We will try and reach out to Syrian rebel groups (such as whatever remains of the [Syrian Opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_opposition)) and officers in Damascus Alliance forces and try and persuade them to our side. While we do not expect much success we will take any chance to give ourselves some form of advantage and weaken our enemies. Even if we only get a couple of rebels or officers it will help us in defeating the Damascus Alliance.

Damascus Alliance: We have gained effective air superiority over the Damascus alliance and will capitalise on this advantage, we will focus our air-force on destroying Syrian and Jordanian Armour and striking defensive positions. We will also try and launch more cyber attacks on the Damascus Alliance, the communications will again be the target, if we are able to effectively damage the communications network between the forces of the Damascus Alliance then they would be disorganised and lacking of leadership when our offensive comes. Our ground forces will focus on closing the gap between Damascus and Amman from our forces. Palmyra is an important city to control and we will focus on trying to force the FSA and Syrian Army out of the city. If we are able to close the distance to the capitals of both nations then they will draw forces from the Turkish border and it might persuade Turkey to join in on our side and move their forces into Syria, effectively sealing Syria's fate (and with the US's inaction in recent affairs we doubt they would mind another nation joining this conflict). If we were to further push into Syria then Turkey would realise that it would be their time to invade and take northern Syria, helping defeat Syria.

Iran: On the Iranian Front we will focus on defending our borders (and the new border at Basra). The Iranians have shown that their equipment is outdated and ours is better (except in the aerial front) and thus we should be able to simply stay put and wait till the Western Front is sorted out before we begin our offensive/discussions with Iran.

Intelligence Gathering: [Our efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/9s7ah4/diplomacy_we_need_allies_quickly/) to reach separatist groups in Iran was met with limited success, we could not contact the groups but we were able to find individuals willing to help us in intelligence gathering. We will ask these people provide intelligence on Iranian movements on the front as to help us pre-empt an attack and ensure that we are not caught out by a surprise attack.

Kuwait, you wanna help a friend out?: We will approach Kuwait and ask that they allow our (remaining) navy ships to intern themselves in Kuwait until the end of the War (in which they would return to Iraq).

9surqv,1,2018-10-30,26 [f4a] New intelligence agent signing up for more than she bargained for,chattycathy92,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9surqv/26_f4a_new_intelligence_agent_signing_up_for_more/,"Tweaked this a little since my last post...
___

I had spent years chasing my dream. Ever since I was a little girl, the intelligence community appealed to me as a future career. The intrigue and excitement I had seen in the movies as a child had always captivated me. The real world was not as fun, however. I had just completed what seemed like an endless amount of studies. A double major in macroeconomics and political science. I had gotten perfect grades at the cost of graduating a virgin. Receiving a masters in international business with a thesis on organized crime in the US. (I even defended it in Russian that I had learned on the side.) Internships with law enforcement every summer and a sterling record with each, every cop begging to write my recommendations letters to apply to the CIA. Maybe it was to try to butter me up so I might let them fuck me in the back of their cop car, but I didn't care. 

I had been called back for the first round of interviews and could hardly sleep. Just because I was incredibly educated and a virgin didn't mean I hadn't learned how the world works. A nice pair of ass and tits walking through the door with my resume would never be turned down. This wasn't the time to play it safe. My interview outfit was a pencil skirt that seemed to threaten to rip it was so tight on my ass and ending just halfway down my thighs. Both nicely toned from the years I spent preparing for the physical requirements of the job. When I bought the blouse I wore, I knew exactly when I would wear it. In the most professional tone, it screamed, ""these perky tits are way bigger than my slender frame would suggest.""

I about screamed when I got the call that I had gotten accepted into a field office in Chicago. I showed up 30 minutes early to my first day and my excitement quickly wore off. My dreams of undercover roles and stakeouts were buried under the mountain of paperwork I was to file. They said it took years of this before I'd even be considered for anything more. This was not what I signed up for.

One Tuesday, 6 weeks in to the job, as I was taking the senior agents their coffee during a briefing, I heard them discussing a new covert operation. It was dangerous, exciting, and would require a female agent to act as a hussy to a local coke running group for as long as it took to get the information. (Please include the work ""pink"" in your message so I know you read this) They suggested it might be a couple of days of solo work, mostly just hanging around trying to overhear something good. However, the 2 female agents balked at the idea of being involved with one of the most dangerous groups in the country. I didn't even remember speaking up, just the looks I was given after I did, the male officers looking at each other and then back at me (well my body at least) and nodding. ""You've got the job...err...what was your name again?""

""Agent Allison, sir.""
____

So, the premise is that I am sent undercover to dig up dirt on a crime lord. The mission should be fairly safe and innocuous sounding in the prep. It's supposed to be a short-term in and out, but when the crime lord won't give up the information and start pushing me, I have no choice but to drop to their level of incivility. 

Open to guys or girls playing anything. I think ideally we could start as the senior agents ""prep"" me for my role (in a realistic way though), then move to the crime lord. I would ask you play both.

I would ask that this try and stay in the realm of realistic, no threesomes on a desk with two agents in the middle of the day. However they might help me dress up to find the right look for my role, etc. With the crime boss, I am desperate to keep things professional but my safety is put in jeopardy if I don't learn to bend the rules.

The main kink for this is the idea that I am ""forced"" to do things for my dream job that I don't want to, but have only myself to blame."
9sux8q,10,2018-10-30,SW intern with a ton of anxiety about a meeting with a parent,followmewhereverigo,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/9sux8q/sw_intern_with_a_ton_of_anxiety_about_a_meeting/,"Hello fellow social workers. I’m an MSW intern and I work in a school. This is my second internship at a school. Meeting students’ parents has always given me sooo much anxiety. I even get anxiety calling them. This anxiety is a lot worse when either A. It’s my first time talking/meeting with the parent so I don’t know what they are like or B. They have been rude to me in the past. 

I think I get anxious because first of all I don’t have a lot of experience with it. And second of all, I’m very young (22) and I look like I’m in high school (in the beginning of the year I would forget to put my ID on sometimes and my supervisor told me I have to make sure I wear it all the time or else people will think I’m a student. Last year at my placement one of my students told me she thought that I was also a student when she first saw me 🙄). So I feel like parents just look at me and assume I have no idea what I’m doing, but maybe that’s just me. Every student on our caseload that we see weekly has to have a biopsychosocial (BPS) completes with the parent. These give me anxiety because the questions are extremely personal and I hate making the parent feel uncomfortable. I mean I’m a stranger to them asking all of these questions. 

Anyway, I have anxiety specifically about one parent meeting. This meeting hasn’t even been scheduled yet but my supervisor told me today that I’m going to have to do it eventually (the child of the parent is only being seen by me as needed, not weekly. Normally we do not complete BPS with as needed students, but the child comes to me often so my supervisor said it would be best to complete one). So let me give a little background. I met with this girl a few weeks ago and did a suicide assessment and found out she has severe suicidal ideation. I called my supervisor and she told me to call 911 and have her evaluated. So I called her mother to tell her our decision and the mom flipped a shit on me. She SCREAMED at me over the phone, called me names, and argued with me until she realized she wasn’t going to win this battle. The mom was at work so the girl’s grandma cane to the school to escort her in the ambulance so I didn’t meet the mom and still haven’t. After the girl was evaluated and came home, the mom kicked her out of the home and they haven’t spoken since. She completely downplayed everything that happened and scolded her daughter for what she said before kicking her out. Her reaction is soooo fucked up to me. How can you kick your daughter out after finding out she thinks about killing herself? So as you can see I’m not very fond of the mom already. And the girl also has told me her mom is an alcoholic and I grew up with an alcoholic mother so I guess that’s my counter transference. You guys can probably see why I’m so anxious to meet with this mom. She already has screamed at me and insulted me and now I have to meet with her and ask her extremely personal questions? I’m sure she hates me for all of this. How do I even deal with this? Part of me wants to just brush it under the rug in hopes that my supervisor won’t notice because I technically don’t HAVE to do it but she would like me to. Maybe the mom won’t even want to come in. I hope that’s the case. 
Thank you all in advance. 

TLDR; I already don’t like meeting with student’s parents and now I have to eventually meet with a parent who screamed at me for sending her daughter to get a psychiatrist evaluation after she admitted to having suicidal thoughts and I am terrified. "
9sw5f9,6,2018-10-31,I feel suffocated by my mother [53f]. My darker-skinned boyfriend is the last straw.,timeforolive,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9sw5f9/i_feel_suffocated_by_my_mother_53f_my/,"Last year, I started seeing someone who has a darker skin colour \[23m\] than I do \[23f\]. Let’s call him Oliver. He's Indian and I am Chinese; we live in a very multicultural part of Canada.

My single mother \[53f\] was vehemently against me dating him, as his skin colour is darker than mine. My mother is college educated and speaks english with an accent.

She almost threatened to kick me out of the house. I was a poor university student, so I finally agreed to break it off with him and stay friends, as I'd only known him for a few months. Oliver is patient and caring and has a delicious body to top it off.

After I broke the news, Oliver and I sat together and did nothing but cry before class, for a week straight, I kid you not. I was in love with him.

We kept hanging out with each other and gradually, we started dating again, in secret.

Over the past year, I have started to quietly… view my mother differently. How can I relate to her with such a fundamental difference?

**To give you some background on her parenting:**

She has taken me to music lessons and paid for them and waited for me for years. Sometimes there were 2-3 lessons a week after school. I’m not Mozart, but I have a performer certificate and I still play for fun.

I can read, speak, write Chinese, because my mother took me to Chinese lessons as a kid (5 days a week) and I enjoyed it. We got free candy, yum!

My younger sister, on the other hand, did not enjoy these things and quit a while after she started. She can only *speak* Chinese, for example.

I attended university using scholarships or “my own” internship money, but my parents always offered to pay.

My mother supported all my hobbies such as photography (buying me a camera), art, and more.

But, my mother has a temper and in the past once in a while, has physically hit me with her hands because it was “my fault” for provoking her (up until two years ago). She has told me to eat dinner by myself at another table at a restaurant (elementary school). She has used a clothes hanger to chase and hit me (high school).

When I was younger, I had a lot of energy and it was hard for me to quiet down, so the hitting began at least when I was around 4. It hurts, I cry. I assume I don’t get hit as much as my other asian counterparts from what my mom tells me, but I wouldn’t know.

It turns out that I was sick when I was 7, and the high energy was a symptom of the illness. I was on meds from then on. My dad also hit me when I was younger, but stopped when I entered high school.

Three years ago, my mother grabbed my backpack and turned it inside out to dump everything down the stairs because she was against me dating this older person who was from across the country. It was like confetti. She was against him because she didn’t want me to move away (I was never going to move with him—we weren’t serious), and he seemed too prepared to meet my parents by shaving and bringing a gift. A big no-no. Means he’s too old and calculating.

She has also grabbed all my shoes and THROWN them out the door like baseballs, in the rain, because she didn’t like the way I moved her shoes on the rack.

My mother criticizes all aspects of my life; my clothes, my friends, my hair, and says she’s the only one who will tell me the truth. She wishes she had someone to “tell her the truth” when she was younger.

I have seriously considered killing myself, twice in my life. I won’t go into this here and I’m not proud of it. Both times were related to my mother. I won’t try it again, don’t worry. :)

Last year, she declared that one of my good friends is making me depressed, so I should stay away from her. This friend was there when one of my family members passed away, amongst other things. I could see why my mother thinks the friend makes me sad, but I don’t think that’s enough to get rid of her.

My mother has asked to keep half of my future salary to help me save. When I was an intern, I didn’t save much and spent money on travel and yummy food and university tuition. I figure I might as well live my best life while I still have time and freedom.

I paid for plane tickets for her and my sister to go on vacation last year (but then she unexpectedly also gave me some money to go on my own vacation around that time) so it almost evens out.

All the money that I earned teaching piano and art in high school, went to my mother. Those accounts are still collecting interest today and I get notifications about them because they’re under my name. I don’t touch that money, though. I don’t mind her having it. (Taught myself a lesson to invest when I have funding!) She asked for that money, she said it belonged to her, and I said okay. I’m asian. Money belongs to the family, honour your parents, blah blah.

**Okay. Fast forward:**

A few days ago, we had an argument about an unrelated issue, and I said I feel controlled and suffocated, and I named some of the reasons above.

She says she didn’t hit me very often or very severely, or else “I’d be in the hospital”. I actually wish I was in the hospital at least once, then maybe someone would’ve educated my parents about how to discipline their kids. My sister was never hit; she has a way with words, and she was cuter.

She says I’m selfish and spoiled. I’m too accustomed to getting everything I want.

My mother says that I am controlling her, if she cannot be open around me. She says that she has given me all the best things that she had, but I am still not grateful. She says I am self centred. She says she is only giving me suggestions because she cares.

“Am I allowed to not follow your suggestions?” I say.

“Well,” she says. “It’s best if you follow them.”

“Then that’s controlling and forcing.”

“It’s not controlling because…” a bunch of reasons. She’s worried about me, she’s caring for me.

She keeps asking me questions like, “If you had a dark skinned boyfriend that I didn’t like, would you choose me or him?”

She keeps bringing up the “hypothetical” dark-skinned boyfriend. She knows I am seeing someone right now but I have not brought it up to her and I’m pretty sure she knows he’s darker skinned.

In the past, she has said that she will “never” accept a boyfriend with dark skin (she doesn't use the word lightly). Her reasons include: Oliver and I don’t look good together, we’ll never be happy, indian/middle eastern people have violent genetics, no one in our family has darker skin like that, people will look down on us, extended family will never accept it, and more. There is no extended family in my city.

If I say that I’m suffocating, I get my whole life story in return: She came to the city and worked 2 jobs to support the family; she worked hard to take me to chinese lessons and piano lessons; she has done so much to care for me and this is what she gets. She is now a single mother who works and pays property tax in an expensive Canadian city. Property tax is expensive!

I do a lot of charity work and volunteering, and it hurts when she starts with: “I cannot believe that such a kind/loving person can say such cold words to their mother and if I didn’t hear it with my own ears, I wouldn’t believe it.”

Two days ago, my mother apologized about hitting me in the past. She says she was a different person back then and she didn’t realize how sad it made me. She also says she thought I provoked her on purpose.

So, I am moving away in a few weeks, to a city that’s a few hours away for a well-paying tech job! I got the offer when I was in university (this is common) and I signed the offer one year in advance (also common for companies to sign students before they graduate). My mother is sad that I’m leaving.

I’m still with Oliver. We’ve stuck by each other through a lot and it’s been a year already. We have opposite personalities (I tend to be a loud, happy person, but hate confrontation, where he can be quiet as a kitten and very blunt). We also travelled around the world for four weeks and I still love everything about him, except his stinky socks!

I wanted to repair my relationship with my mother last week, but man, perhaps it wasn’t meant to be.

**Alright, so my questions!**

1. It’s dawned on me that it’s a possibility that she will try to have a say in my life decisions… forever. I’m asian. If I ask for more control over my own life, I get the arguments she listed above. She cares. She has given me the best of everything. What do I do?
2. How/when do I break the news about Oliver to my mother? Getting rid of him is not an option at this point. Also, it’s not killing me that my mother ""doesn’t know"" about Oliver right now.
3. Am I self centred or spoiled? Am I unreasonable? Is this emotional abuse? (I am not saying it is or not; I’d like your opinion as I have had this my entire life and don’t know anything different.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr** \- Mother controls many aspects of my life but also has given me many great things like music lessons and chinese lessons. She hit me when I was younger, up until two years ago. She objects to the love of my life because of his skin colour. In fact, she doesn’t know we are still together. She says I’m spoiled and self centred. I have a great education and mostly got everything I wanted when I was younger. 

She doesn’t know I’m still with Oliver [23m], who has dark skin. I’m moving out in a few weeks, to a city a few hours away.
When/how should I break the news, if at all?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a junior recruiting for summer internships. I have narrowed my options down to EY FSO Assurance and PwC Risk Assurance in Los Angeles. My goal is to stay at Big4 until manager then attend a top MBA to transition into finance/consulting. My main question revolves around the types of roles I would eventually be able to exit to down the road in either practice? Are there any opportunities that one role would open/close compared to the other?

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally Questions:

If talking to PwC recruiters about switching into core, is it best to ask prior to signing the internship offer or wait on until after the internship ends to ask? 

Are there any pay/workload differences in these 2 roles?

How easy would it be to explore outside of FSO at EY?

Would I be able to specialize in a specific industry doing risk assurance and PwC?

How hard would it be to switch to core assurance with PwC?

What are day to day differences between these 2 roles?

Does the fact the EY have a dedicated FSO mean it will have bigger/better clients in FS than PwC?

Would either firm pay for an MBA contingent on me staying for a number of years?

Any cool/random perks that either company throws at you? (Cell phone, gym membership, etc...)

Any general comments on life/balance at either firm?

&amp;#x200B;

Would greatly appreciate any feedback to any and/or all of these questions!

  
Cheers

9swy10,226,2018-10-31,"A too ""heavy"" loan laptop",kanersps,ChoosingBeggars,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/9swy10/a_too_heavy_loan_laptop/,"Good morning/evening/afternoon/night reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

So I've posted here before with something that happened at my intership at a IT servicedesk. Here I'm back with another story that happened recently. Some eleboration on the company if you haven't read my other post. You could skip this part if you'd like:

&amp;#x200B;

The company issues laptops to every employee, these laptops are however still owned by the company. You have to give them back once your contract is terminated. If a laptop breaks for whatever reason you get a loan laptop until your one is fixed. You can choose to not get a loan one but you can't pick between them. We have older models ready as loan laptops and no other ones(No exceptions). 

&amp;#x200B;

So this lady a bitlocker key issue, she called ahead and told us she had to enter an unlock key. Sure, this happens from time to time and we could fix this within an hour if she came by. So we asked her to come by so we could fix the issue, as giving this key over the phone wouldn't be feasable. She said she could not come by because of an injury she had. After a hassle and about 5-10min of talking about that it just wouldn't be possible without her coming by she said she would get her husband to take her. Because with her injury she couldn't drive.

&amp;#x200B;

So she arrived about 15-20min later looked just fine but alright not all injuries show that you are actually injured. So without issues she threw her company issued laptop on the table and said to fix it. So I took the laptop and said it would take about 20min to retrieve the key. As we need another employee to get them for us, that person was at a different location so I had to send a skype(Yes we use skype for business) message to him and had to wait. Calling wasn't possible as he wasn't at his desk and didn't have a cellphone with him.

&amp;#x200B;

So I told her all of this and said: ""Ugh that takes way too damn long, just get me a loan laptop so I can atleast work! And keep the laptop here!""

&amp;#x200B;

Uhmm okay I responded with: ""It's company policy that for fixing software related issues that take less than an hour that the employee stays with us incase we need you to test things.""

&amp;#x200B;

She declined and insisted she had to go for about 10 minutes which ended with her calling her supervisor. Which is fine I suppose, so I called mine to make an exception for her as I was having a difficult day. My supervisor approved this, she came back mad almost threw her phone into my hand and said her supervisor was on the phone and I had to talk to him. I said that my supervisor already approved us keeping her company issued laptop until hers was fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

""Ow okay then, hurry up so I can go"", she took the phone back and I just started getting a loan laptop out of our storage. I came back and instantly she asked: ""Uhmm, is that laptop heavier than my current one? I can't carry heavy things now!"" These laptops were indeed a bit heavier, about 1.2x heavier. So I said: ""Yes it's a bit heavier."", she didn't even try she used one finger to lift it a bit and said: ""No we can't do this! It's way too heavy! THIS WONT WORK!!"". I said this is the only loan laptop we have. She did not agree: ""Uhmm no I \*\*need\*\* to work with a laptop! Get me a different one."". I insisted that this wasn't possible so I took the laptop back.

&amp;#x200B;

She just instantly went away leaving her laptop there and just saying: ""I'll contact my supervisor about this, awful awful service. Can't even consider that not everyone is a f\*cking body builder.""

&amp;#x200B;

Well, fine I guess! Leave without a laptop, I can continue doing my job just fine. I did send my supervisor a mail about this whole thing so he would be prepared to get an email about her supervisor about this. I was a bit agitated about this afterwards as I was also this a student and an intern and this made me very uncomfortable."
9sx99r,2,2018-10-31,My Story and the process,Fujimari89,NarcissisticAbuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/9sx99r/my_story_and_the_process/,"&amp;#x200B;

I was with my (n)ex for almost 7 years.

I try to type this down, because I thought about it and I think it might help me heal.

(Please spare with me for any typos, since english is not my first language)

We met when I was still in a relationship with another man. He didn't give me anything and so I fell hard for this charming man in front of me, that told me I am the most beautiful woman in the world and outstanding and perfect. I still don't regret this decision, because the ex before really put zero effort in and we had a long talk about that and ended it maturely and I knew that was not how I wanted my life to go.

The first 2-3 years were amazing, we barely fought, we couldn't stop seeing each other and we moved together about 6 months into the relationship, because we already didn't spend a day apart.

After this time we started to talk ""seriously"" about marriage, kids, house etc. we were both on one page. He would finish to study, get a job and we'll get married. Of course he promised and never delivered. After he finished his studies, he went on another field, that took a year - it was okay to me and I supported him through all that time. Then he went abroad for 3 months - I supported him though it broke my heart, but I wanted him to go where he wanted to be in his career.

I had a hard time, because a collegue and friend of mine got murdered. All my ex did was ""I wish I could help"" and went away. This made me angry as well, because I just wanted a hug and some shoulder to cry on.

After those years it slowley crawled in, he started belitteling me about my own flaws and quirks. I changed for him, because I loved him and wanted this so badly to work, but as soon as I concentrated on one flaw 2 or 3 others came that bothered him - it was an endless cycle.

When he did overtime and I asked when he would come home so I know when to start cooking, he acted like I was totally controlling.

He guilted me when he couldn't sleep - though he was the one that played on his tablet or watched TV deep into the night, leaving me sleepless as well. When I asked him to stop (which was not that often, because I am a relative deep sleeper) he would guilt me into dictating his habits. He had his friends over for a boardgame night every week on tuesday, leaving me sleepless as well.

When we started dating he was a student and I worked in retail. I wasn't happy there so he supported me as good as he could. I then started a job which I really liked, but my collegues were untruthful and gossiped  about each other. I was complaining alot about that, because I was raised to be upfront, which not everyone likes. Then the cycle of ""I wish I could help you"" and turning around playing on his phone or PC started. I finally decided to switch fields again.

We then worked in the same field and as soon as I told him about a success I had with something, he told me this was nothing, he faced XY and that was so much harder. I felt useless. And he did that all the time

I encouraged him to apply for the job he had, he started out as intern and worked his way up. I was really proud and told him so often. When he had the job he studied his field this year.

Marriage on that point was out of question, because we both were busy and he needed to adjust from student life to work and student life. I totally understood that and not brought it up. As soon as he worked full time he got offered a project abroad in his company, which he wasn't sure to take. We talked alot about it and I figured this is a one time opportunity and we both made pros and cons about it, until he decided he wants to do that.

When he was there I flew over almost every weekend (even on my own birthday and that was my decision). He started to tell me how expensive that was (it was the cheapest airlines and flights I could possibly find), which I understood and offered to stay and not see each other. He then said that this was not what he wanted either so I left the choice to him. He then told me it was my fault he didn't get to see his parents, and that hit me hard.

He was still very attached to his family. If for him he would see them every weekend from friday after work till sunday evening. Considering we met when I was 21 and he 22 I thought it was nice for him to have such good connection. The only problem was, that this never got looser over the years. He guilted me alot for not seeing his parents enough, though we were driving to them almost every second weekend (sometimes even more) and stayed over night mostly. I always told him he can go whenever he wanted, but I didn't want to come with him all the time.

When I would raise concerns, that he might need to detach a litte he blew up on me. He told me just because I have a shitty relationship with my father (which is so untrue - my dad and I talk every week on the phone, but it happens that we don't talk if there are no news, and we both know we are there for each other when a problem arises) I can't understand his amazing relationship with his family. I was dragged there everytime. His parents were nice, but I always had the feeling they didn't ""approve"" of me, because I didn't study and I had tattoos and piercings. Also it just got boring sitting there around every weekend.

After 4 years or so I started to talk about marriage again and was blocked immediatley. He said he wanted to make a career first. He already worked and made alot of money... but okay. I waited, but anger about that grew in me if I am honest.

The other thing is - when I started the relationship with him I accepted his aunt to be my doctor (and his mother was her assistant), since I needed one anyways. I am really afraid of doctors (I had a whole in my heart and spend alot of time in hospital when I was little, so I assume this stems from there). And there were times when we drove to his parents and they laid suringes next to my plate. I always felt examinated and got really anxious when going there. I told him about that and all I got was ""you should get used to it by now"", ""we have always done this"".

In the relative end of the relationship I refused to go with him to his grandmother and parents, because I had headache and honestly I was exhausted and anxious. I should have communicated better with him (I admit that was totally my fault). He then drove off angry and started sending me pictures of the laid table and guilted me, because he would look bad in front of his family ... he admitted after that, that this was not okay at least.

On my birthday in June on year 6 of this - We were away for my birthday, because tbh I insisted. We had a relativly pleasant time and I still had the thought of marriage in my head (I don't know what drove me there). As it didn't happen again, I bursted out in tears in a restaurant - followed by him telling my I was embarrassing him.

After that the worst part and what sticks in my mind is what happened at a birthday party from his friend (I take this out of a comment of mine, because even writing it down hurts so much):

We were running around with waterguns, because it was hot in august and it became kind of a tradition since the year before.

My ex told me I was embarassing him and how childish I was to run around with it. I then sat down, played on my phone while he continued to play with the others.

I called him out on his double standards and he actually apologized.

As I was sitting and playing with my phone silently (to not embarass him any more), one of the guys that didn't know me stood behind me and threw a bucket of cold water over me, my personal belongings, and my phone.

First I screamed in shock that all my belongings are now wet, since I was sitting there at least 15 minutes doing nothing. I then looked at my bf who looked at me like it was totally my fault. I then stood up, asked for my shoes and left.

I just wanted 10 minutes to cool off the shock and go back and I could have probably laughed about it.

My bf ran after me, held me and said I was ruining the party for everyone, I am so embarassing and overreacting. He grapped my hand and it hurt. I told him I just need time to cool off, he insisted on me going back immediatley and apologize (??).

I initialy just wanted to go for a walk to get dry again and come back shortly after but after that I went to the railwaystation wich was 40 minutes by foot and went home completely soaked. While I was going home I received a couple of messages of my bf telling me how it was all my fault, how I am the worst, how I can embarrass him that much.

I was crying all the way home. He stayed there with the car until after dark and came home with more accusations about his friend (whos birthday party it was) had health problems and continued to tell me how I ruined his birthday now and what a terrible person I am and I should have known and so on.

I should have left the relationship immediatley, but I wanted to make it work so bad.

As I confronted him, that I just wanted him to say something to the dude (not much more like ""this was not ok"") - he then continued to tell me how it was my fault.

This was the breaking point ... At that time I felt so angry, because my gut screamed ""WTF - stand up for yourself"".

&amp;#x200B;

We had a HUGE fight, where I was honest and told him EVERYTHING that has been bugging me about him (and that was a long list tbh) and all he had was that I screamed, so I must be abusive and I need help.

Stupid me then still continued to work on the relationship, because we had such a perfect time at the beginning.

We agreed that from now on we'll be open to critizism and start working on the little things to get the relationship going again.

I had a scene where I waited for him over 2 hours (I think) and he didn't write me and then were unhappy - he then said it was my fault, because I should have gone home. I always picked him up when he told me he makes it on time, because we both worked in walking space from our home. I thought it was a nice gesture, but he thought it was controlling.

I leased a car (that I couldn't drive, because I was too anxious), because he always told me it was my fault he didn't see his parents enough. I told him he can take it whenever he wants to get to his parents, he just has to write me that he is gone, so I won't worry.

Backround to that is that he and his sister shared a car and she became a doctor herself, so he was not really able to get to the car often.

In the end I started to really SEE what he does. For example - I pointed out that he never asks me how my day was and I always ask him. I said it nicely as something I want him to improve. He didn't ask me once after I talked about that and told me it was my fault, because I always write him, while I'm at work and there is no need to talk about that for him.

He was calling his parents DAILEY, both of them, and his sisters as well. So when I would pick him up he was on his phone at least 10 minutes. If I didn't he was on his phone at home. After a while I stopped saying ""hello"" to him, because I felt stupid standing next to him, while his attention was not with me. So I played PC, which was a HUGE issue for him. He had alot of double-standards in the relationship and always turned it into my fault.

I got discarded on new years eve last year. We had a home party with a couple of friends, I prepared everything and it was nice. He gaslight me (wich I know now) this evening, but I ignored it, because I wanted to have a good time.

We went out to the bridge at midnight and he didn't walk next to me and he didn't kiss me after midnight and ignored me to party with his friends. Still I managed to stay calm, but I told him that it bothered me and it ended up in me being controlling again. I let it slip for the sake of the evening and at 4 AM our guests left. We were joking around cleaning up - I really felt a little happy in that moment. When we were finished he went to brush his teeth and I fell asleep on the couch (apparently with open eyes?) and all I remember was that he screamed at me, that I shall not ignore him. I was like ""WTF? I fell asleep"". He then called his sister, told me he couldn't take this anymore and left.

I was a broken mess still trying to find an answer to what the hell just happened. I waited for him to come back, wrote him - and didn't get an answer. After 2 days or so he told me it was really over (I still thought for us and begged him to come back and talk to me).

I was a mess the next days after, didn't sleep, my whole world broke down. As soon as I felt a little stronger I started searching for an appartment. I talked alitte with him, because he didn't want to come over to sort our stuff out.

I told him I would leave some stuff here and he is free to sell it or dump it, because I couldn't take everything.

One evening I was playing on my PC, before I packed it up, because I made endless calls and appointments looking for a flat and I was exhausted and needed to distract myself a little. He then guilted me that if I have time for playing PC, I have time to sell my stuff myself to get money out of it.

After that I went almost NC, because I just couldn't take it anymore. I found a flat and with the help of my lovely collegues I could transport new furniture and organize someone to get my stuff to my new place. This happened in the first month. My ex didn't come home and thought he was super generous to let me stay one month in his flat and don't just drag me out.

He made a contract where he told me he would give me money for the stuff we bought together (which tbh wasn't even a little close to what I gave him and we bought together over the last 3 months but I was thankful still). I honestly was shocked as he sent me a 2 side long contract of what I am allowed to take. He then argued with me because I had to sign first or wouldn't get the money - it was just more than awkward for someone who claimed he loved you for so long. He didn't find the courage to come by to sort our stuff out until the end and I just saw him twice after he rushed off. Once when I moved my stuff and picked up my cat and when I reached out to him once to get some stuff I forgot (and he wouldn't even let me into the flat).

After 3 months a collegue of mine joked about getting in tinder. I thought okay why not, without any intention. I made an account where I took a stupid photo at the office and just started, because whatever.

First thing I saw was his profile, perfectly managed - Bio, pictures, as if it was there for ages (with pictures that I took from him as well) ... I don't want to know if he cheated, because this would have ultimatley crushed me.

I am still NC and I don't intent to ever have contact with him again.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things he did that stick in my mind still:

He twisted truths. I remember one time I stood in the kitchen and cooked and I sneezed, he was on his PC with headphones on and suddenly told me I screamed. This happened many times until it was more of a question in my head like ""I screamed?"") .. I was defending myself and as I look back, I think he never apologized for that ... In the end, I didn't even know anymore and apologized anyways for the sake of the relationship.

He always compared himself to his friends and collegues - everything. If they have a bentley, he needs one too. If they go into fancy restaurants, he goes there too etc. (His collegues were way older then him and earned alot more ofc - so where is the point?)

He started pointing out things I could do better for me to ""improve"". At first I thought I wanted to help me so I took his adive. It started small with little quirks I had, then the way how I dress, my piercings, my tattoos, the way I naturally behaved (very cheerful), and so on.

He acted distant and I was always overreacting, a dramaqueen, immature, childish and embarassing. He told me those things for so long that I still get triggered if someone tells me stuff like that, even if it is a joke.

In the end I wasn't even able to make a phone call and get anxious, when someone called me. I made my drivers license and was so proud at myself until he told me he doesn't like to be in the co-driver seat and wants to drive himself. Stupid me let him as I became too anxious and I wanted him to be happy.

When I raised concern about something it was always not that bad, just the way he is or he has always done that and I am the only one who finds this weird, so I must be wrong.

He always interrupted me when I talked to him, no matter about what. He always apologized, but did it almost everytime. When I pointed it out the 100th time, he just said that's how he is. I started to walk away from him, when he did this.

He was distant and cold and he told me it is because I have anger issues and he doesn't want to upset me (note from me - not acceptable behavior from me, I never had anger issues and since that never have - but I still work towards controlling my emotions better throughout this year).

When I talked about marriage and what we said it was also my anger issues.

When I said we need to talk about our emotions, it was my anger issues.

Nothing was ever his fault - EVER. If something made me feel bad, I was too sensitive, overreacting or it was simply wrong.

He was on his phone constanly - discribing this as ""quality time"", when I told him I wanted to spend more time together as couple.

He dragged me to expensive restaurants to show off with his collegues and friends. I said I couldn't affort this, since I made way less money than him. It was okay for him - for a while. He then guilted me, because he was spending all his money on me. I have to note here: I never argued about money - he ordered stuff online for me (because I was just super anxious) and I asked him what he gets and in the end I just gave him all my money except maybe 100-200€ for grocery.

When I leased the car I borrowed 2000€ from him and as I payed back the last sum and told him proud that this is now the last payment as we agreed and we are even he blew up, because he ordered something for me I forgot (something for like 15 € or so).

I was not allowed to change anything in our appartment. not move any furniture or do anything. It took me 4 years to change it a little so it didn't feel like a students appartment anymore. He blew up on me, because I put down a huge living room arrangement, because it was already falling apart and might hurt the cats and we agreed on redecorating the livingroom. When I came to pick up my last stuff he was clearly redecorating everything.

His cousin lived with us for good 3 years, because he didn't have the balls to tell her to move out. I liked her, but I was aware that we could afford the appartment on our own and I wanted to take the next step. I was guilted because I wanted us to live together as a couple and that I was dillusional, because my family is so f\*\* up, that this cannot be done to family. Were it for him I assume she would have lived there until the end of our relationship.

I cooked for us - he never really liked it, never brought in ideas on what to cook. And his answer was often ""that again?""

I cleaned our big appartment, his mother came by and critizised the cleaning - it was my fault (though he never raised a finger) and we need to hire a cleaning person.

He had only the job of taking the trash out (guilted me for producing so much trash, because I pointed out that he could do it more often), vaccuum clean (he bought a vaccuum clean roboter and guilted me, because I have long hair and it gets stuck in the brushes), and cleaning the toilet - which he only did when someone came over.

His best friend cheated on his ex, I was totally shocked and my ex knew how I felt about cheaters. He told me, it's not as bad as I make it.

In the end and even after the breakup he couldn't point his finger on what I can improve (I was asking constantly and after he broke up I wanted an honest answer) other than the outbursts.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My journey so far:

I had just a hand full of friends all my life, many aquiantences but I lost them all, because I devoted all my time and effort on this relationship, because I thought he was the one. He didn't like any of them, so I neglected them in favor of him (I still hate myself for that sometimes).

When I managed to move out I felt a little back in controll. I had a small but nice place wich I could decorate like I wanted. I reconnected with a friend of mine who I hadn't talked to in years. She was still okay, but hurt (understandable), but she listened to me and knew a friend who lived nearby, and tought we would get along very well (this guy is now kind of my best friend).

That's when my healing process finally started, because I didn't know him. I was disillusional and blamed myself for everything. We met and he saw how miserable I was and told me to just tell him everything.

So I dumped all that onto him - and he was shocked. I then started to reflect, I didn't know anything about narcissists or abuse so lurked alot in relationship subs, started there, found my way into abusive subs and then stumbled upon this.

Since that I have been learning alot about myself, my weaknesses (I am co-dependent, a people-pleaser and a caretaker), what I need to improve.

I still don't have the courage to go to therapy, because it is very stigmatized and expensive where I live. But I am looking at ways to make it possible for me, because I KNOW deep down that this will help me.

With my best friend I relearned to drive (he was super patient - I didn't know this was possible). He spent time with me, when I was really down and really saw me shine with every little success I had. He was also lonley and happy to have someone around to hang out and we both cheered us up. He took all his courage and found a nice girlfriend as well.

I started to engage new hobbies. One was medievil markets my best friend works on and asked me if I wanted to try this, because help is always needed - it is hard work, but so much fun as well. I concentrate on myself, doing stuff I like and enjoy. Through this work I met a man, who really shows me what it means, when both people put effort into the relationship. He is not perfect, I am not and we both know and talk openly about it.

I am still a little stuck on the DARVO System and I thought 10 months to write this all down. I have no contact to our old ""friendgroup"" and I don't care if he reads this. Still I feel guilty about it. What really made me think was something I read on another sub, about the outbursts as a result of yearlong abuse - I thought I was alone with that and that I am really crazy for that.

I sure had my fair share of immature behavior, there is no doubt about that and I could have reacted better, I could have stand up for myself more and set more boundaries and I should have let go way sooner.

Edit: after he rushed off we wrote a little and I told him I don't know how to go on from here, my world shattered and my dad told me he called to tell him I wanted to kill myself..

As I relive this so much more comes to my mind ...

How he told me I was responsible for making him fat, because I had the habbit of eating in the evening, because I didn't eat lunch at work and ""forced"" him to eat something too.

Even in the end my dad realised that he thought about himself to be perfect, that he seemed a littel ""megalomaniac"".

I am so glad this is over ..."

Should I try and work full time right now? Do employers typically hire pregnant women?  Should I be looking for something in my degree or should I be looking for more part time work instead?

Every so often I get the wild idea to collect all the magazines in the game. I'm doing the same in my current playthrough. Unfortunately I always find it a hassle to figure out which ones I've already got, especially if I haven't touched the game for a while.

So I decided to build a site where I can track which ones I have, which also includes the location tips and the effects of the magazine, as listed on the Fallout Wiki.

It's still a work in progress, mainly adding all the different magazines (currently I have 44 in there already, but copy pasting all that stuff into the backend is quite a chore. I should get an intern at home...). I know the styling is pretty crap, but I'm trying the function over form concept for once. I'm pretty sure I can get the rest of the magazines and Bobbleheads in there today, but in the meantime I wanted to share it with you guys and hopefully someone else will also find it useful.

The site uses a cookie to save what magazines you checked as collected, so if you reopen the site in the same browser after a while, it should have saved your progress.

Anyway, here it is: http://aramor.epizy.com
Hope you guys like it, can use it and if you have feedback, post it here and I'll see if I can do something with it. 

Edit: all magazines and bobbleheads are now added

Edit 2: my brother-in-law had a good suggestion, I'll also be adding unique equipment in the near future. "
9szclt,136,2018-10-31,I Tried to Kill Myself Last Night,LortianDawnrunner,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9szclt/i_tried_to_kill_myself_last_night/,"I never thought that I would reach that level of low again, despite knowing just how many people it would harm, and how many other vulnerable people it would effect, I tried to do it. I have always battled with suicidal thoughts, always been wanting to but making sure I kept on moving, but last night was just too much for me. I want nothing more than everything in my life to just stop, to back up and give me room to breath, to find just a bit of time to just get the mess that is my emotions and mind under control... but it is relentless.

I tried to overdose, but failed. Stayed awake until the early hours of the morning, saying goodbye to friends just saying I was going away for a while. I cannot even describe how much dismay and disgust I had when I woke up in the morning, almost two hours late for class. Sat through and just forced a smile and laughed when speaking to people, and just went about my day almost on autopilot, as if nothing happened at all. Now I am just one day closer to failing my dreams as my obligations aren't being met, exams, assignments, interviews for internships... all just coming up, and I can barely even muster the effort to keep on breathing, but I cannot stop working either. I have an interview for my dream internship in 12 hours, but all I want to do is just sleep forever.

I cannot keep on going, I just want my emotions to calm down, my brain to stop being a clouded mess, the damned crushing disgusting feeling in my throat and chest to go away. I just want it all to end... but I cannot tell anybody. The person I tried to open up to is going through the exact same thing, so instead I am just helping him get through it. I cannot open up to him too, I know he would want to make a pact to go out together.

I am in a prison of obligations of my own making, my dreams for success are the things causing my pain, but also one of the only things keeping me going. All I have to look forward to is slowly losing the ones I love and care about, until I die miserable and alone. Ultimately all stories end in tragedy, and my journey is not one worth living."
9szes3,1,2018-10-31,Me(23M) having gift giving issues with my ldr girlfriend(23F),armyrelthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9szes3/me23m_having_gift_giving_issues_with_my_ldr/,"My girlfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for 9 months now. This is my first relationship. We met online a few months before we became a couple and I visited her after 2 months of starting dating. Right now I am in the army also until next year's spring.
And for the record this is what I am struggling a lot with - we are not physically together and I find myself unable to notice many nuances about the other person.

Recently we have hit an issue with her birthday which was coming up. She talked about how those days were special and I need to also show that to her.

Prior to this, I had sent her a care package before leaving to another country for an internship, which consisted of letters, ""open when"" letters, my shirt and a necklace.
She asked for something that she could carry with her and remember me by. I chose something from my culture that had a bunny carved to it (she used to call me her bunny).
She was however visibly devastated by this as it wasn't something that she had expected.
She had expected something like what she carries every day - a silver necklace which is plain and not sparkly.
I apologized and made a promise to get to know her better.

Now her birthday was coming up and I was inquiring about things she would like to have as a gift.
Firstly she said that she doesn't believe that I know what to get her as evidenced by the necklace disaster. Also that I don't know her although we have been together for so long (which for me is not so long and we are 2000 km apart having spent only 3 days together physically).
We found something together when I proposed to make a game of it by her giving me a site to look at and her telling me if I am getting warmer or colder by showing different jewelery.

Later on however she told me not to get it as it was too expensive (it was not for me really but I respect her decision) and even later on saying that she did not like it anymore.

We got into another issue of me not knowing how deep her feelings for me were and if she loves me. I like hearing feedback on everything I do and I explained to her that hearing words of affection make me feel loved. She told me that she is the opposite and doesn't want/need to hear them. This was also an issue previously when I didn't feel good for not hearing compliments and it turned out that she was not feeling lust towards me and that I was not handsome in her eyes.
A month ago I proposed for us to make the love language quiz as I wanted to know what her love language is so that I can get to know how she shows her love. It turned out to be acts of services and gifts. While mine were words of affection and spending quality time.

Based on these, I set out to find a gift. I showed her some jewelery I thought she would like but they were not in her taste. She told me not to get  jewelery because I did not know what to get.
I thought about a poem (as I wrote many of them in the start) but after knowing that words of affection were not her thing, I decided to drop it.
Then I thought about sending her a Spotify playlist of music she would like, but I turned that idea down as I did that once before, but I she did not comment about her listening to it or answering if she liked it. I took that as meaning that she didn't.
Then after pondering for quite a while, I decided to ask her if there was something specific she would want or a gift idea. She told me no and that I should be able to come up with it myself as this is an instinct in every man. Which I seemingly don't have.
My next idea was then to buy her flowers (daisies are her favourite), chocolate and arrange a romantic and relaxing date (having a dinner, watching a movie and playing a game we both enjoy) for 3 reasons:
1) She liked when I previously had sent her flowers but later on said that it was feeling too much and I stopped.
2) The overall gift would fulfill her two main love languages: a service and gifts
3) A relaxing date would help her current situation which is stressful

A few days before her actual birthday, she visited her relatives and celebrated her birthday that way. She received gifts from her friends and family. I planned to give mine on her actual birthday and then congratulate her.

However before that, I told her about my plans and asked for what she thought of them - was I getting closer to knowing her or not.
This erupted into us having an argument.
Many people asked her what I got for her birthday and she said nothing. Later on she talked about this with her friends and came to the conclusion that it is a rubbish gift - something friends do and something we do constantly.
Which I agree. However it was all I could think of with the knowledge I have now.

I tried to come up with solutions that would not make this happen again:
- a list of things like on pinterest of things I could get to her on days like these (she turned this down by saying there is no thoughtfulness in it)
- saying what kind of a gift she wants for starters so I would get to know her style and wants later on
- a book or a website giving me advice on how to find things that suit her

She told me that this should be an instict and that I am already 23 and I should know what to do by now.
I am a person who learns from example and doing things over and over again, which I explained to her. She responded by saying that this is an universal thing and I should have known what to do.

And now here we are. We are here to ask for advice and solutions as to how I can become a better gift-giver and how we can avoid this situation from happening in the future.

**tl;dr: Am I borked in the head for not being able to know from the top of my head what my girlfriend wants for a gift. How do I make myself better in knowing what the other person wants without them outright saying it?**

Edit:
I am the female side of the story and I would like to add my parts of the story to make a clear judge around everything. And I am sorry to write a long story about things we can fix.

Me and my boyfriend (both 23) have a ldr. He is from Finland and I am from Turkey. We have a good understanding of each other and a nice rhythm.

I love him, he is the best supporter I have and just the one whom I want to build a future with. But there's a big problem which grows between us. He is more inexperienced compare to me, I am his girlfriend, sometimes its a journey that we both learn, sometimes it's just painful like today.

I was in Canada in order to complete my research time. Before I leave, I just said I want something that i can wear all the time which is small yet rememberance of you. He gave me a wooden bunny necklace which is nearly same to playboy rabbit. And I was totally frustrated bc I asked smt nice yet got a playboy rabbit.

And during my time in Canada. We talked about plans for my bday. And I said like 5 times that I find 3 dates important. My and his bday and our first year anniversary. He knows it. Firstly I wanted a bracelet but then I found it expensive, bc he is in the army and I didn't want him to spend 50 bucks just for a bracelet. It would be too much for him and I said I didn't like the bracelet obviously I adore it but it was expensive and wanting it wasn't the most correct idea. Since it's a gift, he should have find a good one which he wanted to buy.

When the time was closing to my bday he started to ask what to buy as a gift. In Turkish culture its not acceptable to say what you want as a gift. And since he is my bf for 10 months he should be able to find smt nice and meaningful. After the bracelet, since he loves meaningful gifts, I thought it would be a book he loves or smt small as pricey but big in meaning. But he didn't buy anything at all. He said he just wanted to spend the day with me as usual, the game lotro and a Skype call plus buying a flower. Tbh, he knows that I don't like to idea of flowers bc they only last for 2 3 days. And giving money for it just craziness. And, doing the usual things doesn't sound correct to me.

I am totally broken, hopeless about him and devastated. He knows how much I wanted it to be special. I don't care about seconds and so. It would be our first and firsts are important for me. I don't know what to say or do. I know, I am his first but buying a gift is a simple thing. According to me, even a bad gift shows that someone cares about you which is obviously better when your friends give you small gifts but your bf doesn't do at all.

And he is the closest one to me. Having him like this was a shock bad for me. I am open to ideas."

9t068q,5,2018-10-31,[M4FFFFF+] Overwatch on Glassdoor: “Internship was lit. Good food. Great boarding options. Tracer gives head like a champ.”,SuckMyDPPenis,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9t068q/m4fffff_overwatch_on_glassdoor_internship_was_lit/,"Of course, that’s not the review I actually left, but maybe if Hana begged a little harder I would have. I’m kind of getting ahead of myself, though, so let me explain what’s going on here.

Two years ago, when I was sixteen, I went to the museum with my little brother. The poor kid broke his wrist like a week prior and was cooped up inside the whole time while he ‘recovered.’ Frankly, I thought the whole thing was bullshit; he wasn’t torn up about the whole thing since it was his off hand, and within a day of getting the cast he was already flying around the house like a maniac, but Mom *insisted* that her little baby boy not risk it by going to school for a while. It wasn’t all fun and games, though. Like I said, he was forced to stay inside, and Mom practically butchered Timmy’s lessons when she tried to teach him to keep him caught up. Lucky for him, I went to the same school, and I saved my notebooks, so it wasn’t life or death for him.

Anyways, not the point. The point is I felt bad for him because of everything that was happening, and to make it up to him I brought him to the Overwatch Historical Museum. I half expected Mom to object, but of course she was *thrilled* that I was ‘spending time with him’ and ‘getting involved in his hobbies.’ I sort of just rolled my eyes at the time, the way she was gushing over it like it was some big deal, but I never realized just how much it would change my life.

If you’ve seen the security tapes that got released all over the news, you know what happened next. Lots of guns, lots of spandex. I did a lot of staring at butts on the side as a hormonal teenager, then I did some punching, the robbers fucked off and Tracer made Timmy’s day. I did a lot of bragging after. I thought that would be the highlight of my life, too; not many people get to say they saved the day by punching a Talon sniper in the gut. Of course, if I was right, the story would’ve ended right there. So, yeah, I was wrong. My highlight was about to get a whole lot highlight-ier.

Maybe it was luck, destiny, karma paying off or the butterfly effect in action, because I saw a whole lot more of Lena Oxton after that. She spoke at the school district, showed up at restaurants, I saw her in the park, and each time we recognized each other and spoke. Somewhere along the line we traded contact details, and chance encounters turned into planned ones. I learned that she was in state for a while on unofficial Overwatch business. She learned I was on the chess team at my local high school (riveting, I know). It didn’t take long for me to realize that this was what having a role model felt like. She was always there to listen, always eager to answer questions. It felt weird to have a peer that wasn’t a peer.

I guess at some point she began to feel a little differently, because on my eighteenth birthday, after all my plans for the day were exhausted, she sent me a text. In it, she apologized for calling so late, but she had a gift for me and needed me to come as soon as possible. I, of course, was only too happy to oblige, not realizing what the gift was. Yeah, this is going exactly where you think it is.

Lena mounted me like an animal. Perfect, perky tits, tomboy locks that made for perfect sex hair, and a bush so well trimmed you’d swear she took a clippers to it every night. We must’ve gone through two boxes of condoms, each one filled just a little less than the previous one as I mustered up everything in my balls for her— and when we ran out, we switched to anal. The whole time we were doing it, she talked about how she’d been waiting for my eighteenth birthday, how the way I carried myself made her buzz inside, how she was screaming my name for the past month as she fingered herself to this exact scenario. I, on the other hand, was too busy working her holes to talk.

The morning after was... well, surreal to say the least. I thought it was a dream, but that theory went out the window as quickly as it came, because when I tried to sit up another hundred and thirty pounds was keeping me down in a fancy hotel bed. Not that I was complaining; I just rolled over, held the woman as tightly as she held me, and went back to sleep. The next time I woke up, she was up too, eyes locked with mine and smiling like a devil with a soul to claim. I was too busy watching those eyes to notice her reaching under the pillow and pull out an envelope, labeled with the words: **URGENT. OVERWATCH INTERNSHIP DETAILS ENCLOSED.** I guess she noticed when I stopped looking at her and started looking at the envelope, because she only had one thing to say to that.

“There’s more where this came from, luv.”

- - -

**TL;DR:** In which an Overwatch agent gets frisky with a barely legal teenager and invites him to get frisky some more. At the Overwatch HQ. With other Overwatch agents.

The scene we’ll be playing will kick off a couple months after this prompt. Tracer’s just invited Brian (from the cinematic trailer) to serve an internship with Overwatch after he finishes his senior year, all expenses paid. He knows Lena’s ready to get down and dirty with him, but the British brunette’s been very vocal about her opinion on Brian back home, and a couple other agents want their fill of teenage dick— and if they don’t yet, all it takes is a little convincing. Luckily, Tracer is all too willing to share.

I’m typically completely limitless, but I’d like this roleplay to be a little more lighthearted. That being said, I’m more than willing to redefine what that means, so if you want to put a specific fetish into this, feel free to ask.

I’d like to put some focus on these particular fetishes.

**COSTUMES/COSPLAY:** ‘Tis the witching season! Could be one of the alternate skins, could be a new costume altogether. Who doesn’t want to see Mercy in a ‘sexy nurse’ costume?

**IMPREG:** Everyone’s a consenting adult with a lot of money. No reason Brian can’t leave everyone with a bundle of joy in their bellies!

**WATERSPORTS:** Urine’s just hot. Shower in it, pour yourself a glass, or just drink straight from the tap; that golden glory is just *divine.*

**FUTA/TRAP:** I don’t mind if certain heroes are packing beneath their suits. D.Va’s a trap, Mei’s a futa, change my mind.

Of course, four fetishes doesn’t nearly encompass my list. I’m also into BDSM, latex, drugs, consensual abuse, pet play, toys, tattoos, piercings, exhibitionism, and foodplay. But again, that doesn’t cover everything. Certain fetishes may apply to certain heroes.

I can’t wait to see those orange envelopes, guys. Don’t disappoint me!

**EDIT:** Lots of views and a couple upvotes, but no replies! Still open for business, heroes."

9t0lfh,11,2018-10-31,Quirks as Mental Illness - theory,noideawhatbehappen,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/9t0lfh/quirks_as_mental_illness_theory/,"While re-reading the Internship Arc, I attempted to look for some deeper or hidden themes, and it seems like I’ve found them. I’ve always wondered about the specifics of why Chisaki viewed quirks as a “disease”. Of course, they may literally be a disease, but that isn’t really a satisfying answer, from a characterizing point of view. The best answer I could come up with was that Chisaki viewed quirks as responsible for larger societal problems, such as the fall of the Yakuza. However, when I attempted to dig deeper into Chisaki’s past, I realized something else. Chisaki may not view quirks as a disease in the conventional sense…. Rather a mental illness.

From what we can gather from certain flashbacks, Chisaki didn’t exactly have the ideal childhood. We see him cooped up inside a house while the other children are playing. This could entirely be because of Chisaki’s quirk, which would have been seen as incredibly powerful, and incredibly dangerous. Especially if Chisaki had less control over his quirk than he would grow to have, people may have been terrified of him. This social ostracization probably led to Chisaki’s antisocial and psychopathic tendencies. 

 And it also seems like there’s further evidence to my point in the Eight Expendables. A lot of the Expendables are “insane” people, people who’ve been cast aside or ruined by society and their own quirks. And in all or most of these cases, these people were “saved” and “cured” by Chisaki.

Rikiya Katsukame, with the power to absorb vitality, may have undergone similar social ostracization as Chisaki. ~~Frankly, this is the weakest part of the theory.~~

Shin Nemoto, with the power to force people to tell the truth, could never trust people, as his quirk allowed him to see through people’s deceptions and lies. He became quite the unemotional person, purportedly finding no value in emotions. 

Kendo Rappa is a bloodthirsty, fight-obsessed man, possibly due to his own violent quirk. 

Toya Setsuno attempted to commit suicide, but he was saved by a hero. This could largely be a case of quirks indirectly ruining his life, due to the heroes propped up by quirk society.

Yu Hojo was used for his quirk to create crystals, but when it was found out that the crystals were worthless, he was cast aside like garbage.

Soramistsu Tabe, who could eat anything, was afflicted with ravenous hunger due to his quirk, thus finding it hard to live in society.
Deidoro Sakaki, possibly due to his quirk being directly related to causing drunkenness in other people, is quite an alcoholic.

I’m not entirely sure about Hekiji Tengai, being able to create a powerful telekinetic shield. He seems to be the sanest member of the Expendables.

Although all of these people could have been taken in due to how easy it would be to manipulate them, I find it more interesting that Chisaki took in these people because he saw himself in them: men who were broken due to their quirks.

Another piece of proof for this theory is the fact that Chisaki requested for Twice, Toga, and Kurogiri from Shigaraki. Kurogiri’s pure utility is obvious, but I find the two villains chosen to join the Yakuza to be much more interesting. Both Twice and Toga are “insane” people that were practically predetermined to go down the path of villainy due to their quirks. Twice literally saw clones of himself slaughtering each other for days on end, and his quirk constantly exerts a mental toll upon him. Toga is a bit less obvious, but I don’t think it’s hard to see how someone with the power to transform into someone by drinking their blood would be pressured into becoming a villain.

My final piece of evidence is in Eri, who literally believed that she was a curse, due to her own dangerous, destructive quirk. There is quite possibly no one who has suffered more than Eri due to her quirk. However, for Eri at least, there is hope. Deku shows her that her quirk *isn’t* a quirk, rather something that can be incredibly useful and helpful.

9t0r3k,1,2018-10-31,Just got back my LSAT score,bitchbecrazy04,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/9t0r3k/just_got_back_my_lsat_score/,"I am currently residing in India. Completed my undergraduation in Chemical Engineering and I am now interested in pursuing a JD with a specialization in intellectual property resources. 
I just got back my LSAT score and I score a 158. 
This is like below my test average because I had PTing at 162-165. I am utterly disappointed. 

However I have like a 9.7/10 as my undergraduate CGPA and I graduated as the overall academic topper from my branch. I have good research internship experience and a decent background in technical as well as  content writing, most of my extracurriculars are aligned to either public speaking or content and editorial creation. 
I have a good chance of getting into University of Houston, and it's a good program from intellectual property, but I am utterly confused whether I should take a leap or consider a retake. 
A retake is a problem because in India, we don't have an exam until late January meaning I wouldn't be able to apply until February, so that can be a major problem, I might have to wait another year. 
I had my eye set on UC-Berkeley because they have the best intellectual property program, but that seems like a distant dream, I don't know what to do, where to go from here?

Hey guys, I really love analytics and spreadsheets and whatnot, and I was looking for positions where I could use this sort of analysis skills in marketing and came up with these two options. The thing is, I'm not entirely sure which one I should prioritize, or even if they're mutually exclusive. I could for a digital analysis internship in a plethora of agencies or get an internship in Nielsen or Ipsos.

Which one would provide a better opportunity for career growth? Which one of these marketing specializations is more sought after nowadays?

I think I'm being very vague as well but oh well, if there's more information that's needed I will definitely provide it!

Thanks for the help dudes!"
9t1upd,16,2018-10-31,one year ago tonight,blueenoughsky,OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/9t1upd/one_year_ago_tonight/,"last year, on halloween, I was giving out candy, because my therapist said it was a good exposure exercise for my pocd. my crippling pocd, where when even just looking at a children's clothes made me feel like a creep. I was expected to coo over kids in costumes and not go on a circular shame journey. 

to make it extra challenging, my costume top modest but shoulderless, and had a cape covering most of everything.

i asked my parents over and over, fretted and worried and panicked over if it would be appropriate with my covered shoulders, or if thats too risqué and the neighbors would talk about what i creep i was and i would go to jail. 

it went fine

now, a year later, i think all my anxiety was kinda funny

it struck me, as i was sitting at my new internship, thinking about who was going to hand out candy, how much i've changed in the past year. 

I can walk past the kid's section in walmart now. I don't shop at 10pm to avoid the possibility that my cashier might be a teenager. I can drive past a school to get to my job. 

I'm not in a perfect place with my ocd, and i think that as long as i experience anxiety i will inevitably experience intrusive thoughts. It will follow me for the rest of my life. but i've beaten them before, and i will again. 

If you're struggling with invasive thoughts, you will get better, the thoughts will mean less to you and they will quiet and stay quiet. You just need time. 

Happy Halloween ya'll 😈

How does one train themselves to think of other creative solutions? When I generally work on algorithms, I go Brute Force, keep trying out stuff untill some of it works. There has to be a better way!

9t2ezv,7,2018-10-31,Erase Me - Short Story,brandonwlawson,sciencefiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/9t2ezv/erase_me_short_story/,"Sometimes, I use to hate myself for what I did. I mean I loved Samantha; we we’re married for 13 years, but sometimes I just needed a break. Every man understood that. It’s not that I didn’t love her. I just had to go on trips to enjoy my freedom. Victoria was a nice and beautiful girl. I met her when I was sold a car to her and her boyfriend. She told me he wanted to get married, and she was fine with that. However she didn’t know if it would’ve work out because what we had going on. I told her everything was going to be alright. She didn’t have to sell herself short; she could’ve had it both ways which is what I did. It worked fine with me.

“We kind of went overtime. Are you sure Samantha won’t suspect anything?”

“I told her I was staying late at the dealership. She believes me every time.”

I was lying in bed next to Victoria. I got out the bed and started to put my pants on; she just rested in the sheets.

“I don’t know if I want to marry Rick. It doesn’t feel right with what we have going on.”

“Then don’t, find someone else.”

“That’s not what I meant, Bruce. I mean I want to be with you.”

“You are with me.”

“No, I mean how you and Samantha are with each other. I want to be with you.”

“Victoria, we been through this many times already. It won’t work out.”

“You claim you want me, but I am confined to this room.”

“Victoria, let’s not do this right now. It is stupid to-.”

The door was kicked wide opened which caused me to stop speaking. I turned to the side, and that was when my mouth dropped at the sight of my Samantha looking onwards at us.

“Samantha,” I gasped.

She started shaking her head and tears began to fall from her eyes.

“I knew it, Bruce. I fucking knew it. All this time you been cheating on me. I knew it ever since last month.”

“Samantha, I can explain.”

“No! There is nothing you can say. How can you explain sleeping with another woman!?”

“Samantha, it wasn’t his fault.”

“Shut the fuck up! How dare you try to stick up for him after you took my husband from me!?”

I started to sweat. I glanced at Victoria and she seemed scared.

“You, how old are you?” Samantha questioned Victoria.

“Twenty………. Twenty three.”

Victoria had her head down when she mumbled.

“23? Wow, Bruce, you are sleeping around with someone who is 22 years younger than you. What, 5 years between us wasn’t young enough for you?”

“Samantha, I’m sorry.”

“So, am I, Bruce.”

Samantha stormed out of the room before she slammed the door. I was broken, distraught, but not because I had cheated, but because I was caught. I knew if I would have not been caught, I would had no problem resting in bed with my wife later that night. I couldn’t help how I felt, and how I felt made me realize what a terrible person I was.

“Bruce, I’m sorry.”

“It’s fine, Victoria. I’m going to fix it.”

I put on my shirt and shoes and ran out of the hotel. I got into my orange Lamborghini, and drove to our house in the hills of Los Angeles. When I arrived home, I saw Victoria’s Honda sitting in the driveway. The lights were off in the house, so I assumed she was crying herself to sleep. I didn’t get out of my car; I didn’t even turn it off. I just sat in my car, contemplating on what I had done. It’s such a shame that it takes tragedies to happen for us to realize what we have done wrong. Only in our darkest moments, do we really find out what it means to be in the light. Human beings always shatter what they love the most, and only care when their dreams are broken.

I didn’t get out of my car. I drove on. After minutes of driving in the pouring rain while the moon shined on, I arrived to a warehouse. I got out and approached a door where a very large man who stood over 6’5 was at.

“Can I help you with something?” The man asked.

I showed the man a card.

“I was given this card, by a friend of mine. He says this will solve my problems.

“Well, it depends.”

The man laughed as he opened the door for me. The warehouse was very small like a convenience store. It had light fixtures on the top of the ceiling. Its floor was cement, and its walls were painted brown. There were plenty of computer screens on the walls. In the middle of the room was a black chaise longue. A man in a white doctor’s coat approached me.

“Hello, what do you want me to do for you tonight?”

“It’s not me, it’s my wife. She caught me cheating.”

“And you want me to wipe it from her memory?”

“Yes. She said she suspected me of cheating since last month, so can you wipe that part from her brain up to last month?”

“Well, that’s going to be tricky because she would have to come in here, and do it herself.”

“Well obviously that’s not possible.”

“Exactly.”

“So you can’t do it?”

“How do you figure, that she somehow ends up here, so I can do the memory wipe?”

“I don’t know, you just have to help me.”

“Okay, okay.”

The man went over to a desk. He began typing on the keyboard before a liquid in a glass syringe came out of a machine. He picked up the syringe with the blue gooey liquid and came over to me.

“This was something new we started working on here. It’s a mobile memory wipe. You inject it in her body, and it does the trick. I configured it, to wipe the part of your affair up to last month out of your wife’s memory.”

“You want me to inject that stuff into her!?”

“Do you want to save your marriage or not?”

I sighed.

“Thanks.”

I grabbed the syringe, and proceeded to walk out of the warehouse.

“Remember Bruce, that’s another Porshe.”

“Of course, Ralph.”

I drove home. When I arrived to my bedroom, Samantha was fast asleep. She didn’t seem like she was resting easy. Her body was laid all across the bed. Her arms and legs stretched out, and her face just plummeted onto the pillow. I felt bad. I knew how much I hurt her. It was tearing her apart, but it was going to be alright. I was going to fix everything. You just have to forget things. In order to not worry, you must not remember because the world only goes away when you don’t care.

The next morning, I woke up in bed. When I turned to the side, no one was there. I got dressed before going downstairs. I saw Samantha making breakfast, and music was playing.

“Samantha?”

She turned around.

“Hi, Bruce.”

“How are you feeling?”

“Good, I made you some breakfast.”

She placed a plate of blueberry pancakes, eggs, and bacon on the table. She then carried a cup of coffee to the table as well.

“Thank you.”

I sat down at the table.

“You don’t feel strange or anything?”

“No, why would I? Why are you asking me these questions?”

“No matter.”

Once I was done eating, I headed for the door. Samantha and I kissed each other right before I headed out.

“Thank you,” I smiled.

Before I went to the dealership, I drove to the hospital. I walked to the ER where in the lobby I saw Victoria in her nurse outfit.

“Victoria,” I spoke as I approached her.

She turned around.

“Bruce, what do you want?”

“I need to talk to you.”

“About what? Haven’t you already ruined your life enough by being with me?”

“It’s fine. We have no worries now.”

“What are you talking about?”

“I’m talking about with Samantha. It’s all fine.”

“You two are getting a divorce?”

“No, we’re staying with each other. You have nothing to worry about Victoria. Everything is back to normal with us.”

“What did you do?”

I lowered my voice.

“I had her memory wiped from the incident. To her, it’s like it never happened.”

Victoria gasped.

“How could you do that?”

“I made a mistake, I understand that, but I couldn’t let that take away everything I had. So I had to fix it.”

“I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel about that. I mean you say you made a mistake, but it seems like the only mistake you believe you made is being caught. You feel no remorse about what happened.”

“Victoria, we messed up, but I was able to fix it. If my wife had never walked into that room, you would had no problem doing this.”

“I know, but it made me think. What we’re doing is wrong. It’s something I cannot do anymore.”

“Victoria.”

“Goodbye, Bruce.”

She walked away. I lost her, but I still had my wife; the least I can do is go back to Samantha. I went on to work. Everything went back to normal. Over the next 2 weeks I lived my life. I actually enjoyed it with Samantha more than ever. We were happy. One day, 2 weeks after Victoria’s departure, I went back to where she worked. I decided I was going to apologize to her, so we could have ended on good terms.

“Excuse me,” I said to the nurse at the table, “Is Victoria Wilson here?”

“Oh, I am so sorry. She’s dead.”

“Dead?”

“The police found her body in her apartment this morning. She was shot in the chest.”

I was speechless for a moment. The air was taken out of my lungs; I felt like I was going to collapse.

“Do they know who did it?”

“Not yet.”

“What about her boyfriend?”

“He’s been in Washington visiting his mother for the past week.”

I walked away from the desk and began to leave the hospital. I heard more about Victoria’s death on the radio. The news said the bullets from the gun belong to a glock 19. When I got home that night, Samantha greeted me.

“Hi, Bruce! How was your day!?”

“It was fine, thank you.”

“I made you some dinner. It’s your favorite!”

I looked at the table where my plate was.

“You don’t usually cook since you’re always tired from your job. That’s always my job.”

“Yeah, I know, Bruce, but I feel in a giving mood today.”

She was smiling so much at me as if it was forced.

“Thank you Samantha.”

I sat down and began to eat. Samantha sat down on the other side of the table and started eating. She kept looking at me with a huge grin.

“What is it?”

“Nothing, I’m just so excited!”

“What for, did you land a new home today?”

“No, but I just feel so happy to be here with you. I mean this is so great! Don’t you feel lit?”

“I suppose. It’s just another day to me.”

“And that is something worth living for, Bruce!”

It didn’t feel right. I know she was my wife, and her memory was wiped, but she was acting different from unusual. All of a sudden she was so happy and cheerful. She was feeling this way all for what? It didn’t add up; something was up. The next morning, I woke up to breakfast in bed. It was on the desk where a note was at. The note read *Nothing better to start the day with than a good breakfast! Love Sami*. I ate, and got ready for work. This was all too easy. I drove back to the warehouse where I spoke to Ralph.

“What can I do for you today, Bruce?”

“That stuff you gave me to give Samantha, you said it wiped her memory from me cheating on her up to last month?”

“Yeah, exactly how you asked for. Is there a problem?”

“I’m just curious on how it worked.”

“The liquid is made out of nanites that are sent to the brain to flush out the memory it’s set to wipe. That’s how the mobile stuff works.”

“Is it possible for it to not work, like fail?”

“I mean nothing works all the time, but in terms of wiping out selective memory, our technology works all the time.”

“Thanks.”

I left the warehouse and went home. No suspect for Victoria’s death rattled me. If Ralph was hiding something from me, he wouldn’t tell me. I was going to have to find out the truth on my own. Samantha kept her gleeful spirit up. I started to get accustomed to it, but I still didn’t let up. I knew something was up, and I was going to get to the bottom of it. Over the next few days it was the same routine. I would go to work, come home to Samantha who kept with the some cheerful attitude. It didn’t die out; it was as if she was a robot. I didn’t know what it was; I didn’t know how to find out, but I knew it wasn’t what it seemed. One night when I came home from work, I went to the back of my trunk to take something out, and that was when I found it. I found a gun that I have never seen before. I was puzzled; I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t touch the gun, but I observed it. I then realized it was a glock 19; the same kind of gun that was used to kill Victoria.

“Dear, God,” I gasped.

I slowly walked into my house. The lights were off which was strange since Samantha’s car was parked, and she didn’t normally go to bed around that time.

“Hey!”

I turned to the side where Samantha had jumped out from.

“I cooked a special dinner for us!”

The table was set up not like it normally would be. A red cloth and candles were spread across the table. On my plate was lobster, mixed vegetables, and garlic bread. In my glass was red wine. Samantha’s plate was the same. She sat down and began eating.

“What’s this for?”

“For our love,” Samantha claimed, “let’s toast to it.”

She began drinking her wine, but my stomach felt cold, so I barely and slowly ate.

“You don’t like it?”

“I do Samantha. It’s good; thank you.

My heart was beating very rapidly as my hands were sweating. I couldn’t believe what my wife had done. I was in love with a murderer. *She must have known about me and Victoria, but how? She had her memory wiped, or did it go wrong? Did Ralph lie to me? What if it worked, but some way she remembered, or she still found out? What is she planning on next,* I thought to myself.

“I bought some cake. It’s your favorite, Bruce, red velvet.”

Samantha went over to the refrigerator, and took out a cake. She placed it on the table. She went back to the counter where she took out a chef’s knife. Instead of going to the middle of the table where the cake was, she started to circle around the table. It rattled me in a wrong way. She was just circling around the table, going behind me with a knife in her hand.

“You know, the funny thing about marriage?” She asserted as she stopped right behind me.

She then bent over and placed her mouth next to my ear. My heart rate shot up the roof.

“Is that you know your spouse better than they think you do.”

I looked at the knife as the tip pointed at my throat. I jumped out of my chair.

“That’s enough!” I exclaimed as I pushed Samantha away.

“What’s the problem?”

She had a look of embarrassment and confusion on her face.

“You! Stop the act! I know what you’re doing!”

“Huh?”

“You’re acting all sweet and nice just to fool me, but I know what you’re planning!”

“Bruce what are you talking about?”

“You know! You know!”

“Know what!? I don’t know what you’re talking about?”

“You know that I slept with Victoria. You killed her, and now you’re trying to fool me! I saw the gun placed in my car.”

Samantha’s mouth dropped, and she put her hands near her mouth. She looked shocked, but it didn’t fool me.

“You cheated on me?”

“Oh, cut the shit, Samantha. We both know you know!”

“Bruce, I am confused.”

She started to walk towards me.

“Stop! Stay away from me!”

Suddenly we heard a knock on the door. We both turned, but we didn’t go towards it. The door was knocked on several more times before we walked towards it. I turned my head back to make sure Samantha had kept her distance. The knife wasn’t in her hands anymore. When I opened the door, there were 2 police officers and a man in a suit outside.

“Can I help you?”

“Hello, I’m detective Wade. Are you Bruce Bell?” The man in the suit asked.

“Yes.”

“Mr. Bell, I am placing you under arrest for the murder of Victoria Wilson.”

My heart crashed into my stomach when I heard those words as Samantha gasped. The two police officers placed me in handcuffs.

“What is going on!? Why are you taking him!?” Samantha cried.

“Mrs. Bell, your husband murdered the deceased. We traced the bullets back to the gun that your husband bought the night she was killed.”

“No, this is a mistake! I didn’t do anything! There’s a gun in my car, check it, my finger prints are not on it! I never touched it; I found it!”

“We’re going to need the keys,” Detective Wade declared as the officers held me in handcuffs near my car.

“They’re in my pocket.”

One of the cops reached into my pockets and took out the keys while Samantha looked on in fright. The detective opened up my car. He placed gloves onto his hands and reached into my car. He took out the gun.

“We’re going to get the finger prints off of this at forensics. You’re coming with us,” He stated.

“No! This is a huge mistake! She did it! My wife killed Victoria! It wasn’t me!”

It was no use. They hauled my ass into the back of the car, and drove off. I couldn’t believe what happened. I knew it was a huge mistake. I don’t know how, but Samantha killed Victoria and framed me. I was hoping that my story checked out. Detective Wade entered into the integration room where I was sitting in.

“Listen, I didn’t kill anyone.”

“We matched the finger prints on the gun to yours. The evidence is all there. The DA would just want to know why you, a successful car dealer who had everything: perfect house, perfect car, perfect job, perfect wife, and a perfect life decide to kill a 23 year old intern at a hospital.”

“I didn’t kill her.”

“Whether you tell me or not, you’re going down for a long time. We can make this easier, if you help us.”

“Look, I was having an affair with Victoria, but I didn’t kill her. Samantha did.”

“Oh, so you think your wife found out about it, killed Victoria, and framed you in revenge?”

“That’s exactly what I am saying!”

“Well that sounds convincing. The only problem is that we checked your wife’s alibi around the time of Victoria’s death. She was with her friends. Everything was confirmed.”

“I don’t understand. How is this possible?”

“Live in denial, Bruce. It’s over, you’re finished.”

I was placed into a holding cell. I felt stripped of my dignity and my life. They even had me in brown prison clothes. I didn’t feel good. Suddenly a person came into the holding room. It was Samantha. I ran towards the bars where my face was pressed against.

“Samantha, you have to tell them. I didn’t kill anyone.”

“You had it all, Bruce. You had everything you wanted, but it still wasn’t enough for you, and for that you lost everything. I am very disappointed in you. I thought you were better than that. You broke my heart.”

She began to cry.

“Baby, I didn’t kill anyone.”

I stuck my hand out, but she backed away.

“It’s over Bruce. I just hope you find solace in your confinement.”

She began walking away.

“Samantha! Samantha!”

Over the next few hours, I sat in my cell. I couldn’t believe this was happening to me. I knew innocent people get thrown in prison, but I would have not believed it would happen to me. Someone else entered into the room. I got up and saw Ralph.

“Ralph?”

“I should have knew this was going to happen. Although it wasn’t my fault, I just feel like I have to help you.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Here.”

He handed me a syringe. It was the same kind I injected Samantha with, but this one was filled with a red gooey liquid.

“Inject yourself with it.”

I injected it in my arm. Suddenly I started to see memories coming to me. I remembered,

“Victoria, I want you, can you just come back to me?”

“No, Bruce I told you it’s over.”

“I’m going to leave Samantha for you. I don’t love her anymore, I love you!”

“I already told you! Now leave me alone! I don’t want you, nobody does!”

Emotions of anger had filled into my memory.

“You stupid, bitch!”

Gunshots fired, blood all over the floor, and a lifeless shell of a woman; Victoria’s dead cold eyes looking up.

I turned to Ralph.

“It can’t be. What….. what was that?”

“After you had your wife’s memory erased, and Victoria ended your relationship, you went back to her. You two fought, and you killed her. You came to me, to have it erased from your memory. When you found out she was killed, I suppose you thought your wife did it since you still remembered that you had her memory erased from her catching you two together.”

“Samantha never knew?”

“No. It was all in your mind.”

“But what about how she acted. She was acting all nice.”

“I added happier emotions to her memory to make you feel less of a bad husband. They took time to set in, around 2 weeks. Nevertheless, even if you knew that, it would have not stopped you from what you did.”

“No.”

“I just felt like I should tell you, so you can know why this happened to you.”

Ralph walked away.  It was all coming back to me. Samantha was right; I had everything I wanted, but it wasn’t enough. For that, I lost everything. This was something I couldn’t forget, to make it go away. There was no easy way out. All this time, I kept looking for short cuts to get rid of my flaws, and it worked for some time, but it finally caught up with me. I couldn’t escape this. On the contrary, I had to do something I never done before, to make it all right. There was one last thing I could do, and everything would go away.

As the bed sheets were wrapped around my neck, I knew this was the way for me to go. I felt the high pressure of strangulation pressed on my throat. It wasn’t quick, or painless. It was perfect; it was what I deserved. After all the things I was wrong about, I was right about one thing. The world only goes away when you don’t care."
9t2ump,16,2018-10-31,Worst neighbor(s) that I've ever had the displeasure of living under.,diego27865,BadNeighbors,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadNeighbors/comments/9t2ump/worst_neighbors_that_ive_ever_had_the_displeasure/,"Quick background: Gf, dog, and I move into an older home (definitely needed some work to be done) in the bottom unit, and was told upstairs neighbor was one woman who lived by herself and apparently was nice. We've been living here now since June 2018. 

How our interactions have been up to this point: Never got to fully introduce ourselves, as the first night we moved after about 8 hrs. of moving, we basically just passed out. To our surprise, on this first night we were moving in, the upstairs neighbor decided to throw a party with multiple people, blasting music, obnoxious loud laughter and hollering. Now, we tried to ignore it, but it went until approximately 4 am and even with multiple attempts (short of actually going upstairs and knocking) to ask them to keep it down and even knocking on the ceiling with a broom handle, we were at our wits end. Therefore, we decided to ask our landlord if he could: 1) provide us with her contact information so that we could at least try to text her and have her number for anything in the future; 2) Ask if she regularly had parties and to just give us a heads up next time; and 3: ask her to keep it down. 

This apparently set the premise for a long (and still ongoing) grudge against us that has been unrelenting. Within the week, we did manage to run into her as she was pulling in, so we tried to introduce ourselves and let her know we did not mean to ""complain about her"", but mainly wanted to get her contact information so that either we or the landlord could let her know we desperately needed sleep that night. She proceeded to basically ignore me after I asked if she worked at the local medical college (I am a med student myself so I thought it would be a great icebreaker) as an intern to which she scoffs at and said shes an, ""emergency nurse"". Apparently being asked if you're a doctor is now an insult. 

Anyways, for the first few months she would never stop to say hello when we would and would ignore/avoid us any way she could...even go as far as to wait at the top of the stairs if either me or my girlfriend were leaving the house (there's a shared stairway for the first and second floor that we both use). Although this was incredibly irritating to me, both my GF and I decided we should not judge her and always try to remain polite and friendly. The lease for both units states we are to share landscaping upkeep and to take down our own trash. 

It ended up resulting in me doing the lawn the entire summer, and even up to about a month ago, where she did the lawn for the first time, and eventually complained to the landlord about us saying we never picked up after our dog. I was livid. Over this time period, I even ended up taking her trash/recycle bins down the driveway when she would forget (which was more often than not). So as you can see, there was no respect for us whatsoever.

Most recently, she stated seeing this guy and having him, and his dog, over almost every day. The first day she had a dog over, she was at work. The dog had been barking for almost 2 hours straight near the end of the day, and my GF and I were concerned about it as it had not been taken outside in well over 8 hours. So, I texted her very politely and just wanted to let her know that it had been barking for a while. We were met with extremely nasty texts that basically just blew up my phone bringing up the first night we moved in, to where she lied about how the lawn was atrocious etc.

She has lied multiple times to our landlord already, and even thought we were naive enough to believe her texts to us. Instead of me responding in a similar matter, we decided to text her back apologizing and saying that if there were any future issues to just let us know, so that we can come up with solutions and be respectful. 

Finally, after all of this, the offer of peace and possible solutions were just ignored, and even went further saying, ""respect goes both ways"". Within this last week, I had been put on a 15-hr shift (I work as an EMT) and she and her boyfriend were being incredibly loud and sounded as if they were dropping heavy objects on the ground several times. So, I texted her about my shift and asked if she could please keep it down. Just to clarify some things: this was a Thursday night, it was already 1 AM, and I had to be up at 5:30 AM (which I also let her know, since normally 1 AM isn't too incredibly late and I try to be fair when she is super loud). 

The result was degrading and completely disrespectful, ""I've worked plenty of 12-hr shifts for the last 10 years...stop texting me nonsense...get over it"". This is not even paraphrasing; this is exactly what she sent. I did not respond, but finally had enough so my GF and I let the landlord know about EVERYTHING and we still have had no response yet as to how any of these issues will be resolved. We are at our wits end, and are so worn down from the toxicity that is our upstairs neighbor. What do we do? "
9t2wdh,14,2018-10-31,Is marriage out of reach for most (young 23-35) men?,islamchump,MuslimMarriage,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/9t2wdh/is_marriage_out_of_reach_for_most_young_2335_men/,"For me it is, Unless you play the economic game, give up your personal inclinations/wishes, and just be a pre med engineering computer science, you’ll be fine.

But if you choose a different path, why bother? It’s not feasible to get married given our Muslim/ethnic cultures and American culture 

What I don’t understand are all these engineering/pre med younger men in my college so concerned and come to me for consolation 

Like I say to them, you choose THE path that makes it more feasible, you’re graduating on time with internships exp research etc, you make dua and pray and I see good character from you, why are you worried? I tell them your  degrees ranks above me, (even though I’m older) 

I don’t get it, I willingly choose a path of “poverty” I willing choose path that makes marriage not feasible/practical (even in late 30s), why are they worried? 

I don’t imagine the economy being bad for such the professions they chose (I have small worries for computer science majors and the rise of contract jobs) besides the point, why are they worried? 


If they were worried about the social/family requirements that’s a different story but like your gonna be making 50-80 k out of college, literally why are you worried? "
9t31tm,3,2018-10-31,Need Opinions on Job Offers out of College,mwar646,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9t31tm/need_opinions_on_job_offers_out_of_college/,"Quick facts about me: I am an graduating in May 2019 with a Accounting major, Finance and Information Systems minors. I currently have a 3.71 GPA and 3.34 accounting GPA.  I will have over 150 credits and plan on going taking the CPA exam. 

So far I have had two internships:

1. An audit internship with a state government office that audits other government agencies
2. A tax internship with a large local firm

I also might have a job at a tax firm at a location near where I would like to live. I have received offers from both internships.  I have turned down the audit offer- I learned a lot but did not enjoy auditing much at all. I enjoyed the tax internship and would like working there, however I would not like to live where the firm was located. 

I am worried that if I take the job with the better location and it ends up not being a good fit, I would not be welcome back at the tax internship firm if I turned down their offer. 

I am currently trying to decide between a job at a firm I don't know at a location I'd like versus a job I know I would like but at a location I don't like. Which would you choose?

9t3am7,17,2018-10-31,600 GMAT to 730 GMAT in 7 Weeks,Lastplaceheroes,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/9t3am7/600_gmat_to_730_gmat_in_7_weeks/,"I thought you guys might like my detailed progress from a 600 GMAT to a 730 in about 7 weeks.

While practice problems aren't a perfect reflection of deliberate practice and don't reflect time spent learning new topics, they are a good yard stick for time spent studying.

Of my 11 total tests taken, I scored a 740 three times - each was an Economist GMAT practice test which may be a bit more lenient in grading, and each of which had questions (both in quantitative and in verbal) that I had seen before. As a result, while I may have ""scored"" a 50 in Quant multiple times, I don't really count those scores.

I chose the Economist GMAT program after using the free-trial versions of Veritas Prep, Manhattan Prep, and Economist GMAT. I found that Veritas and Manhattan forced-fed you practice problems without much focus on strategy, and that the answer explanations seemed very copy-and-pasted. Overall, I loved the Economist GMAT prep.

My final, actual score was a 730 - 48Q/43V, 7 IR. Because I was under good test taking conditions and paced myself well, I think it's tough to rationalize taking the test again - but of course, I'd like to see myself score a 760 or above to help get into my target schools.

What do you think? Should I take it again?

I'm looking to apply to B-School in September of 2019 - and plan to add more volunteer experience before then.

I've always enjoyed reading other's GMAT progress, so I wanted to share mine too.

Thanks!

I want to do something related to financial markets (maybe commodity markets) as I have an internship in trading at a bank for next summer so i want to try and get a little more practice.

9t3dyf,3,2018-10-31,Girl [20F] I'm sleeping with has been sending bizarrely mixed signals ever since I [24M] met her.,tobyps,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9t3dyf/girl_20f_im_sleeping_with_has_been_sending/,"So for a little background, this is about a girl I met this summer at an internship. Here's a recap of our ""relationship"":

* When we first met at work, it was pretty obvious she was attracted to me. I would constantly catch her staring at me and she would do little things like offer me food and go out of her way to walk next to me.
* We started flirting over the office Slack. She'd message me throughout the workday and send me random memes and use flirty emojis. She also started texting me after work and on weekends.
* Us interns traveled somewhere for an internship event and stayed at a hotel. She invited me to her room alone and the two of us ended up making out in her room, and more, over the course of a few days of the event.
* But after we returned from the trip, she started acting distant. I thought she wasn't interested anymore and that I had done something wrong.
* Then she told me that she wants to continue this, but isn't looking to start a serious relationship and wants to make sure we're on the same page. The reason she gave is the distance (we go to school 4 hours apart) and she doesn't want a long distance thing.
* We agree that we're FWBs. But despite what she said about not looking for a relationship, she (of her own accord) holds my hand in public and arranges dinner and movie dates with me.
* After the summer ends and at the start of the school year, she invites me to visit her at college. I make the drive up and spend a weekend there. Again, despite saying earlier that she didn't want a relationship, she took me on some romantic sightseeing thing across a bridge and through a park and held hands with me the whole time.
* When I leave her campus, she texts me something like ""ughhh can you come back, it's cold and I want to cuddle"". In the following weeks she continues texting me, and refers to future plans.
* A long weekend is coming up that we're both going home for (we're from the same state). As we both live with our parents, we had nowhere to hook up, but I still wanted to see her to just hang out.
* I text her saying the long weekend is coming up and we should hang out soon. This is about 3 weeks after our last visit. Looking back, this is the moment where something changed.
* She doesn't reply to me for 2 days, the first time that's happened. When I follow up she says ""ahhhh sorry I meant to respond earlier"" and says she needs to talk to her parents to see what they have planned for the weekend. She never gets back to me. In fact, in the time since that moment (about a month) she hasn't initiated contact with me once even though previously she frequently texted me.
* When the weekend itself comes, I ask her again and she gives an explanation listing all the stuff she has going on that weekend (brother's birthday, upcoming midterms and interviews) for why she isn't able to hang out.
* A week later I text her again, asking if she's up for a visit. Again, she takes almost a day to reply. When she does, she says something like ""the next two weekends are def out but maybe the one after?"" but then wants to make sure I understand she still isn't looking for a serious relationship.
* Another week goes by with no contact from her, and I finally message her straight up asking if she's still interested in continuing this. She says:  
Yes, definitely  
I just felt a little awkward with you offering to drive all the way to \[her city\]  
But we've cleared that up so  
Yeah, I'm still interested :)
* I'm not sure why she suddenly thinks it's odd that I'm offering to drive to her, when I already did so on her invitation a month earlier.
* Last week I ask her when she's free, and she replies:  
Heyyy, my family's planning to come either next weekend or the one after that  
Once we figure it out I'll let you know  
Just message me if I don't get back in a couple days lol
* Of course she never gets back to me. A few days ago I ask her again, and she finally names a weekend that she's free.

I guess I don't have a specific question. I'm just extremely confused by her. Everything about the way she's acting is giving me the sense that she isn't interested anymore, yet she's still agreeing for me to visit her and spend a weekend together. How should I be interpreting that?

**tl;dr: I'm somehow unsure if a girl likes me even though we're having sex and we have upcoming plans for a visit, due to her constant mixed signals.**"
9t3m9j,3,2018-10-31,"""Break"" or is it over?",Wtfsuckmyduck,MedSpouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedSpouse/comments/9t3m9j/break_or_is_it_over/,"We started dating in college and did long distance when she went to med school. We closed the distance when she started intern year.  First months were amazing since she was on out patient rotations so we actually spent time together. 

Once nights and general wards begun she became super distant and the days she did have off she spent with her co-interns.  I understood that venting with her colleagues is a way to deal with her stress and I supported her as much as I could (cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.).  The nights that we could have dinner/spend together she just wanted to veg out on the couch and that was it.  Again, I told myself it was due to her stress and continued to support her in the ways I could.

Few days ago she got off early and I wanted to go out to dinner with her and she blew me off to go have dinner with her co-intern.  At this point I felt neglected so we had a huge argument.  She told me that she would rather hang out with her friends since they understand what she's going through and even though she knows that I try to be there for her, I can't since I don't have the background to understand and doesn't think I ever will since the rest of her life will be medicine.

Last night she told me she wanted a break.  She said that over the past few weeks she felt like our relationship change and that she doesn't want to end up like her parents and doesn't know if she can commit.  She has another week and a half of her rotation and then she's on her 2 week break.  At that time she'll ""decide"" if she wants to continue the relationship.

I'm at a loss at what to do.  I love her and thought we were going to get married.  It sucks that I have invested so much over the past 8 years and was completely blindsided by last night.  

Is this break delaying the inevitable or do I wait it out?"

We can go into more details or change a few things if you are a F I like you more dominant and willing. Mainly resenting me and for Bulls me and my SO are sub. 

1. Company retreat +
For Bulls
 I work at a business firm  as a intern and work with a complete jerk for a boss he is 44 6'2 240lbs with thick 9 inch  white cut cock. Well you see me and my gf and you find her attractive at the camping retreat in the mountains we all getting ready to leave back home when you ask me if I want to stay with him for an extra couple of days to get extra  ""training"". But the truth is if I want the job I need to let you have her. Convince me to let you bred her for days alone in the mountains.

For F - Basically the same except it's a company retreat for you and your company. You want to go because you have a girl crush on the older boss 

2. Cucked by my Alcoholic father on my wedding night+  
 For bulls 
It's's supposed to be the happiest time of my life and I'm supposed to be relaxing but my drunk, pushy, asshole for a father decided to make us drink more than normal at the wedding. Now after years of him not caring about me he decided that  he will make sure my new wife and I make to our room. As I got to help my stumbling wife he grabs her and says he will let her lean on him... But I see the way he holds her on the way to room. How he treats his hands on her hips and hugs her close.


3. He just a ""friend"" + 
 For bulls and F -my beautiful fiancee is going to a school across the country and she hasn't been texting or calling back but all over social media she hanging out with some friends from college  but one stands out a he's skinny and nerdy but he is a complete jerk to me. Every time I try to say something he has to come in and be all ""technically correct"" about everything and we end up fighting.

My main  kinks include raceplay, cuckold, humiliation, breeding, ,rough sex,anal, rough sex, watching, cheating"

I just graduated from a computer engineering master and I'd like to move to Canada.
Throughout my studies I did 3 internships (1 of 3 months and 2 of 6 months) so I have 15 months of full-time work in my last 5 years.
I'm not sure though that internships can count as work experience. Any idea?

Thank you! "
9t4b2y,0,2018-10-31,Is my ex-coworker creepy?,detectivebabbits,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9t4b2y/is_my_excoworker_creepy/,"Long post ahead, but would really love to get opinions on this situation. 

I (24/f) had an internship at a decent sized company headquarters with roughly 500 - 1,000 employees on campus. The company intended to hire a few full time employees out of my small group at the conclusion of our internship, so I of course tried my best to network &amp; make as many connections as I could. One person I felt very fortunate to meet was the director of the department I worked in, a great leader, kind &amp; respectful business man (about 50-60 years old) Someone everyone looked up to &amp; seemed to like. 

Over the course of my working there as an intern, I kept in touch with him sporadically via company email. Our messages consisted of only  business related topics, like how to be a good candidate for the full time position, how to be a better leader, genuinely helpful advice during that time in my life. 

Seeing him in passing during work, I quickly learned he has lots of other connections/friends in the company that he keeps in touch with, who he would wave at or say hello to. He is a very friendly and likable person, so I think nothing of this &amp; consider myself lucky to be someone he also considered a friend. I eventually get the full time position &amp; am happy to continue working there, keeping in touch with the department director who i almost looked at as a mentor (still sporadically &amp; business related)  

After I have worked there for around a year and become more comfortable, he started to email me to take a walk around the pond (pretty much everyone does this on break/lunch, very public area and totally visible so not creepy) so I agree. It goes well &amp; we start going on walks maybe once a month or so, it actually was a nice break from the day and I felt like i was doing right by keeping connected to a highly respected employee. 

I never really felt anything strange or off about his friendship until I (for some reason) finally notice that pretty much everyone he waves to or says hello to is a female. He always seemed to talk about his female friends, employees, etc. and never really mentioned his male friends, or seemed interested in meeting other males at the company. I try to brush that off, but every interaction after noticing that one detail seemed a little creepy. I still want to keep the friendship and connection so I pretty much ignore my feelings (stupid)

For example: When it was too rainy to walk outside, we would walk in the hallways of more quiet departments far across the building that seemed to be “away” from everyone else we worked with day to day. Like pretty much alone, but still our conversations were strictly business. I also caught him once glancing at my chest on a day I wore a new shirt but I ignore this only because I know he is married and has never been anything but strictly platonic toward me. 

Anyway I eventually quit the job for a better opportunity, and as I say goodbye to him he adds me on LinkedIn. My first week at the new job he private messages me and asks how it’s going. I reply to him &amp; still don’t mind keeping in touch with him. Week 2, same thing. I reply with a shorter message this time. Week 3 or 4 he reaches out again and I take a few days longer to answer (busy with the new job). He messages me just a “?” when I don’t reply fast enough. 

I finally decide since I have a new job I don’t really need to focus on LinkedIn as much as I used to, and the memories of the old job sort of fade away in the excitement of the new gig. I stop checking LinkedIn regularly but when I do, I notice I have several messages from the guy saying “hello?” or “?” Again. He sent a number to text in one message, which I don’t feel right doing. One message said “everything ok?” I get anxiety that I haven’t replied and feel weird altogether so I ignore it.

Eventually get one that says “it worries me when you don’t reply” which I still don’t answer. These type of messages keep coming randomly, I kind of thought he would get the hint that I don’t check LinkedIn and eventually forget... I feel guilty for not replying but I really didn’t have time to message him all the time, and felt weird that he was so concerned about me specifically? 

A few weeks ago I got one that says “what will (my name) wear for Halloween.....?” which I really feel uncomfortable about but can’t tell if it’s innocent. 


Am I rude for not keeping in touch with an ex coworker, or should all of this added up give me peace of mind in not replying to him? I appreciate any thoughts &amp; your time for reading this! "
