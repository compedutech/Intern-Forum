I read the post in the sidebar and it answered some questions I had but I am looking for advice that’s a little more up to date. 

For the past three years I have been involved with starting and operating a small production company based out of Miami with some friends. During this time I have had to fill every role in production but what I‘ve enjoyed the most is Directing, and more specifically, the pre production side of directing: coming up with concepts for music videos, ads, interviews, social media content, etc. 

Lately we have been contacted by other media companies and have had to come up with the concepts and planning for developing 60, 30, and 15 second spots for various clients and I’ve really been enjoying it. Unfortunately our work isn’t steady enough as we are freelance and I am looking for something more secure and structured.

 I am looking for advice on whether or not to join Miami Ad School to develop my portfolio in a more ad-centric way. I have been reading mixed reviews about the Miami campus of MAS which would most likely be the one I would attend so I wanted to see if there were other options or if there is a better route to take, perhaps an internship, or an entry level job in an agency. 

Our company website is www.retronomad.com and our Vimeo is:

Thank you!"

&gt;Not me: Texan gun runner, tribal leader named [Red](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.431272080.1478/flat,800x800,070,f.u6.jpg)with his gang of australian goons, reputable doctor who has a sadistic side, 16 year old Cuban assassin (whom I've adopted), and a cyborged weaponsmith

&gt;[Recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/8fzf7a/nico_brizzi_and_the_cavern_of_secrets/) received news that the don and most of the other Wiseguys had died in a pizzeria bombing

&gt;Mfw everyone in the party thinks it's me who did it

&gt;Genuinely wouldn't have betrayed the Don, would've been happy to let him die of old age and take over afterwards

&gt;Get news that the reading of the will is to be had soon, tell them we need a secure location since, y'know

&gt;TheCubansDidIt.mp3

&gt;Decide Red's hotel is the best place, clean it up a bit, tell the weaponsmith and my adopted son the plan:

&gt;Step 1: After the people arrive and head upstairs the kid is gonna give the drivers and bodyguards who stay behind ~~Columbian~~ Cuban neckties and then the weaponsmith will rig up bombs in the cars

&gt;Step 2: The people will be coming back down and heading towards their cars when we blow them up, just far enough away from the people that they get knocked back but not killed

&gt;Step 3: you guessed it: blame the Cubans 

&gt;While writing this I realise I could have straight up murdered the rest of the Mob leadership but whatever

&gt;At the hotel arrive the Don's lawyer, the Don's daughter, and 2 other surviving Mafiosos whose names elude me

&gt;The lawyer proceeds to read out the will

&gt;Mfw the Don named me Don

&gt;Tfw everyone in the room is convinced I kill him

&gt;Everyone OOC: ""Holy crap anon that must've been some solid scheming you did in downtime to pull this off"" 

&gt;Mfw I loved the old man since he was the only one to not give me shit about being only half Italian and everyone thinks I killed him

&gt;Assure the rest of the family that this is only temporary and am fully willing to give up control once we figure out who did this

&gt;YeahRight.png

&gt;""Could it have been the Cubans? Maybe I should send the kid to Cuba to find information""

&gt;The gun runner speaks up that she has a deal coming soon with some people who look Cuban

&gt;Promises to help us with anything once we assure her if anything happens she will get her 350 000 dollars

&gt;OhShitALotOfGreenYo.jpg

&gt;Remember I am the don

&gt;Ask the GM how much money the Mob can afford to spend

&gt;GM: literally billions

&gt;After a brief moment where my pupils went dollar-shaped, we pay her up front, have her call the people she was dealing with, trace the call to Cuba, decide we are gonna ambush the fuck out of this deal

&gt;Decide the funeral for the old Don will be two weeks from now, the day before the gun deal 

&gt;Everyone starts to leave, their cars explode

&gt;TheCubansDidIt.mp3

&gt;I hire some P.I.s to sniff around the bombing and follow the other 2 Wiseguys around in case it wasn't the Cubans 

&gt;After everyone else leaves I pull out the small silver box I've had in my coat pocket since session one

&gt;Open it, pull out a switchblade, ask the party which one of them wants to go first

&gt;Tfw none of them know what [Omerta](https://youtu.be/BP_AC7opxQQ) is

&gt;Two weeks later at the funeral I keep getting texts and calls from the gun runner who didn't make it

&gt;Rude.jpg

&gt;I even shelled out and bought everyone nice suits

&gt;Even Red's goons

&gt;Even the Weaponsmith got a sleeveless one and we spraypainted his arms black with some cuffs on the end

&gt;Halfway through the service the 2 Wiseguys and the Don's daughter stand up and point guns at me

&gt;The kid being a hired killer pulls out two SMGs and shoots up the wiseguys (don't ask me where they came from), we knock the daughter unconscious, take her to the doctor's hospital

&gt;On the way there I check my voicemail from the gun runner, she's at the gun deal running away because the Cubans turned on her, then a massive explosion is heard and the message ends

&gt;Weird, I thought the weapon deal was gonna be tomorrow

&gt;Back to the daughter

&gt;Me: So why did you kill the Don? He was your father, you'd probably have been next in line after him

&gt;Her: Wait, didn't YOU kill the Don?

&gt;It turns out she thought I killed him and faked his will with the lawyer or intimidated him or something

&gt;I thought she killed him and decided to take me out at the fucking funeral because public display of power or something

&gt;She explains that was in self defence since it was the only place they knew I'd be and I sent people to spy on them, and didn't tell anyone else her plan in case they were secretly on my side

&gt;Mfw I remember the P.I.s I sent to investigate

&gt;Mfw I realise I have no idea who the fuck killed the Don 

&gt;Mfw i realise the daughter just attempted to whack me in front of all of the mid-level mobsters without telling anyone why

&gt;Tfw I calmly explain to the daughter that I'm gonna kill her and frame her for everything

&gt;Mfw she offers to marry me so it stays in the family

&gt;""No thanks if I marry it'll be for love""

&gt;The weaponsmith starts to smother her in her hospital bed, doctor starts vehemently objecting

&gt;This is the man who charges the weaponsmith organs in exchange for implanting him with cyberware and has a private medical freezer with lots of body parts

&gt;The man who wasn't even asked to torture people half the time he tortured them

&gt;The dude who corrupted some of his interns into being my drug chemists

&gt;The genius who combined Heroin and Cocaine into Hurricane, and made a hefty profit off of, which he used to buy more body parts with

&gt;The party is 80% sure he's trying to pull a Frankenstein at this point

&gt;Turns out he just didn't want her killed in his hospital, he's okay to do it outside

&gt;Offers to get us a wheelchair and more sedatives

&gt;We eventually feed her to Nick the Klegg

&gt;Call a meeting of the Mafia, tell them it's business as usual and since we have a lot of openings lots of people will be getting promoted over the next few months

&gt;Mfw I realise I still have no idea who killed the Don, decide I need revenge on those Cubans for killing the gun runner

&gt;Go to the megamart, buy an inflatable pool donut and some speakers

&gt;Take my kid to the Don's mansion, wish him a good night

&gt;Go to the pool, set up my speakers, sit my fat ass in the donut in the pool, smoke a cigar while listening to some tunes

&gt;""Boy I sure do love smoking a Cuban at the end of the day""

&gt;Tfw I started and ended a gang war against a cartel just because they wanted to no longer pay rent on a cocaine warehouse

&gt;Mfw the only person related to the Cuban Cartel I've actually met is my adopted son

POST CREDITS SCENE: 

&gt;The gun runner is alive and well after getting paid by both me and the Cubans for the same shipment of guns, not paying back her supplier whom she bought the guns from on credit, and faked her own death 

&gt;She's in Alaska getting facial surgery

&gt;[Mfw](https://www.50-best.com/images/will_ferrell_memes/not_even_mad.jpg) I get told all this OOC"

8g4v15,1,2018-04-30,Resume Help for Older New-ish RD,ByteSizedRD,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/8g4v15/resume_help_for_older_newish_rd/,"Hello all!  I'm an older student that graduated in 2016 &amp; completed my internship back in 2017.  However right as I finished my internship my grandmother had a cancer relapse and I chose to spend the better part of last year taking care of her at home since she was terrified of going into a SNF and passing away alone.  After she passed it took a few more months to really get my head back on straight again. 

I'm finally back to ""normal""; but now I'm facing the tasks of needing to apply for my license, fill out a resume where I have a year gap to explain to any potential employers, and get ready for interviews in a market where graduated interns have the knowledge/skills fresh and ready on their minds while I've been benched for nearly a year.   I've been staring at a half finished resume for the last couple of days and while I know it shouldn't feel this daunting; I'm finding myself freezing up when writing out my resume and experiences.   

I've lurked in this forum probably for around 5 years now; between debating going back to school, navigating my undergrad, getting into &amp; through the DI.  I've always found answers before either on the search or through online discussions.  However; this one small thing that I've had to do several times already in my prior professional career is beginning to feel like a mental barrier I can't ""logic"" myself out of like I usually do.  Probably a very large dose of ""imposter syndrome"" mixed in with fighting the inertia of a life that came to a full stop and needing a little bit of reboot.  

I was hoping to get advice from the RD's and RD2B's on this subreddit; either encouraging words on how to explain the year long break to employers during interviews, advice on what a clinical interview might be like (the questions and such); or examples on how to build a strong resume where the year gap doesn't stand out.  I know if I stare at this long enough I'll eventually sort it all out in my head.  But I think the last year has taught me anything; its that its okay to ask for help....so this is me seeing if anyone has any advice or help to give.

Thank you in advance!

8g5fug,11,2018-04-30,What are you unmarried 26+ yr olds doing for health insurance?,princessruru,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/8g5fug/what_are_you_unmarried_26_yr_olds_doing_for/,"crosspost from /law_class_of_2021 

the question was originally posed to students going to a UC so it's a bit UC/California specific, but really this question can apply to any unmarried 26+ yr old since we all have to deal with health insurance. 

The benefits of the school plan are pretty good ($200 deductible and $2000 out of pocket max) but the cost is insane. I am healthy with no regular out-of-pocket expenses and I feel comfortable with the coverage my current plan offers for unforeseen events.

I’m also looking into Covered CA and MediCal. I don’t qualify for MediCal this year, but I might in 2019 depending on how much income I have over the summer. (&lt;$16,395/year to qualify). I don’t qualify for any tax credits this year, but will next year. Without tax credits, high deductible plans through Covered CA go for around $240/month or about $2880 for the year.

I plugged in some numbers on the covered CA website: if I have an annual income of $36,000 (the max I would expect from a summer internship), it would cost me approx. $1680/year for a high deductible plan and $7294 for the most expensive $0 deductible PPO plan. Realistically I would choose something in the middle.

Is anyone else unmarried, 26+ yr old, and NOT going with their school plan?"

They do help us with a list of law firms looking for internships, but so far they have only posted nonprofits. The complete list will be posted once the summer term starts. My problem right now is that I do not want a nonprofit (because I’m hoping to get a job offer after the internship) and I am having trouble looking for internships on my own. I want to start looking for an internship at a law firm already so I can start once the summer semester starts, instead of looking for the internship at the beginning of the semester. The semester is only 8 weeks so the earlier I start the better.

Anyone have any experience looking for an internship at a Law firm?"

**Frequently Asked Questions**

* **How did the police get his DNA?** LE used EAR's DNA from a murder in 1980 and created a fake profile and pseudonym on GEDmatch. His DNA matched up with a distant relative (4th cousin) Subsequently, they built a family tree and narrowed down the list of suspects based on age, living locations, and more. They surveilled him and collected something he discarded that had his DNA and uploaded into the system, where it came back as a 100% match.

* **Was he ever a suspect?** No. He wasn't on anyone's radar.

* **Has he admitted to anything** No, according to law enforcement.

* **Where did he work as a police officer?** Exeter and Auburn.

* **Was he a cop during his burglaries and rapes?** Yes.

* **Where did he work after being a cop, before he became a mechanic?** He was fired from Auburn PD in August 1979. He began working at Save Mart in 1989. We don't know what he was doing in between.

* **Did he commit *all* of the rapes in Northern California attributed to the EAR?** Unknown.

* **Did he stop after 1986?** As of right now, we don't know. His last confirmed crime is the 1986 murder of Janelle Cruz. Police are investigating other crimes, but nothing has been confirmed yet.

* **How did he have access to so many vehicles?** We don't know if he did. There's no confirmation on what vehicles were used in his attacks.

* **Did he kill the Maggiores?** Yes, according to investigators. It's unclear what subsequent evidence they have besides geographical location and shoelaces, but he is being charged with their murders in addition to the four murders in Irvine.

* **Did he commit any rapes or murders during the five-year gap between 1981-1986?** So far, there are no links to other crimes, but other crimes are being investigated.

* **Was he ever married?** Yes. He was once engaged to Bonnie in 1970, but they did not get married. He married Sharon in 1973 and they had three children. They separated in 1991.

* **Did DeAngelo frame Oscar Clifton for Donna Richmond's murder** Law enforcement has not commented on this.

* **Is he the Zodiac killer?** Most likely not. Law enforcement has not said anything about him being investigated for these crimes. 

* **Is he Mr. Cruel, a sex offender in Australia?** No. Law Enforcement has ruled out the possibility.

* **Did he really have a roast in the oven when arrested?** Yes, according to Sacramento law enforcement.

* Sadly, most of the FAQs are based on his attacks and the possible encounters with him. They really can't be answered yet because DeAngelo is apparently not talking. So, the questions regarding the town hall, the homework pages, the 7-11 stakeout, the possible female accomplice in attack 24, etc, are still going to remain unknown unless DeAngelo talks. Just because he is arrested doesn't mean we'll get answers to lingering questions, especially when they more than likely will never be positively confirmed regardless of a confession (homework pages for example).

8g6jfu,2,2018-05-01,Are my chances at a loving LTR doomed,themastif19,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/8g6jfu/are_my_chances_at_a_loving_ltr_doomed/,"Long Post. Looking for any insight on whether I should bother dating at this point or move on and focus on being alone in the very long term. 

Here’s my whole situation/story: I’m a relatively healthy, happy female working through some personal issues. I’m 25. With the exception of about a year and a half in college where I was somewhat promiscuous, and that really had more to do with discovering I can blackout easily, I’ve only had sex in relationships. I’ve also been mentally stable and happy outside of this year and a half. It wasn’t a good time for me. It included and followed sort of a mental break down at 22 because of a very bad LTR, money issues, overworking to try to deal with money issues, major problems with the family member who supports me, failing in school when I’d previously always done well, losing a valuable internship, and feeling at a loss without friends. Bad year in the sense that everything piled up in a way it never had so I didn’t have the experience, and I felt completely isolated without a support network. I am not defending my behavior or beating myself up either. It is what it is and I can’t take it back, though I know it wasn’t healthy or how I myself would ever feel comfortable behaving when I am healthy and happy. Now that I’ve experienced that situation, I feel all the more resilient and capable. I know now how much things can come back and always will when they turn that south, and have the experience to deal with such overwhelming bad experiences and loss. 

Anyways, when my long term relationship ended it was kind of the tipping point for all the other issues that had been building up over the months. Shortly following the relationship, I had two hookups. I knew them both but not well. It didn’t make me feel any better or help me mentally and I knew so I didn’t bother trying to continue that behavior. But that was when my social drinking (but on a heavy drinking campus) transitioned into heavy drinking where I was blacking out. I dated a guy for a couple months but we were horrible together. He was a really mean dude and I was a hot mess at the time. I basically pushed him to break up with me by continually telling him it wasn’t working and he made sure to be nasty about it. From there I had blackout sex with a close friend I’d had a crush on for years. From what he told me, I seemed to want to sleep but he was drunk and liked me and kind of pushed for sex. Though we were both upset about the start of it, we started an on again off again relationship over the next two years. He had his own issues and would shut down and go into a depression once the relationship would settle in a bit. He would go from a happy guy who was my best friend to not speaking to me for days to weeks. I should’ve ended it there for good because I didn’t know enough to help him, but he would always turn back into “himself” and beg me to get back with him. In the times when we were broken up I had two more blackout hookups. One guy we didn’t have sex but both physical interactions I was blackout so he understandably decided he didn’t want to date me after all. And I sober didn’t want to casually sleep with him. So it ended. The other was a guy I’d known a few years and thought was cute but nothing happened before. I was once again upset it started with a blackout but saw him for awhile and really liked him. From there it had been really healthy but he moved and I assumed he didn’t want much more. Turns out I was wrong and still care about him but can’t do anything now. I also had my one and only tinder hookup. It wasn’t planned. I had dinner at the house with the guy and we redboxed a movie and it just worked out. I’m grateful it didn’t go badly but don’t think I’ll be doing anything like that again, I deleted my tinder anyway. From there the on and off ex and I dated seriously for the longest stretch. The same issues came up and I couldn’t help and also began to lose respect for him because of his immaturity and he consequently resented me for that, and I ended the relationship. It ended 7 months ago. Since then I haven’t slept with anyone. I’ve gone on dates and kissed. 

I feel back to my old self before the meltdown years ago, and have for about a year and a half. Except now I have the added life experience to help me handle my issues and don’t feel so overwhelmed by problems. I no longer require anxiety medicine to sleep. I haven’t blacked out in a year and a half. I’m happy in my life and when I have struggles I have a reasonable attitude to handle them. I feel happy on my own and don’t need to date. I’d be okay not having someone forever honestly. I don’t need men. I could have a fulfilled life. But I would like to have a companion. I would like to have a family and not just a career. I also don’t need to date right away. I also didn’t tell the details of all my healthy and happy years here. I included the details of my darkest time. I have led a relatively healthy life. 

My issue is: everything I read online from men, every single bit of it, is black and white on women with an open sexual history. All men seem to agree that if she’s ever been promiscuous, she is not worth taking seriously. She is for fucking and throwing away and you date and marry the girls who hold out. That these women will cheat on and leave you and you’re a cuck if you take them seriously. The idea of what’s slutty varies, but still. After reading this I’m kind of feeling hopeless about having a romantically fulfilled life. I don’t need to sleep with any men, and am not putting out with guys who aren’t taking me seriously. I don’t need validation or attention, I just handled the worst time of my life irresponsibly. I also don’t need anyone to take care of me or even rescue me from being single. I would just like a companion at some point. But if according to men, I’m doomed to not being respected/worth anybody’s time/treated like a person, should I even bother? It’s not a question of respecting myself. I feel so young and ready to take on life at 25, with enough experience to handle future struggles. But would all decent men write me off as undateable or not worth it at this point because of my history? (Having had 3 hookups that didn’t have to do with dating, and 3 blackout hookups even though they were connected with dating). Men, do you consider a history such as mine an indicator of who I am entirely, or a deal breaker? "

8g74zb,13,2018-05-01,10 Minute Power Hour is telling the fictional story of a once popular YouTube channel desperately trying to stay afloat,dabutte,gamegrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/8g74zb/10_minute_power_hour_is_telling_the_fictional/,"So, before I go on, I want to clarify that I very much know that nothing in 10 Minute Power Hour is real and that Arin and Dan are very much performing for the camera. I’m not alluding that the Grumps are struggling to stay relevant in any way; if anything, they’re more popular now than they’ve ever been. 
But, and maybe this is because I’m a huge fan of mystery web series and ARGs, I’m analyzing this show a bit too much, and I’ve started to notice some things that have lead me to a theory I have about what Arin and Dan are doing. From this point on, to make things hopefully more simple I’m going to talk about the show and its “characters” in the context of the show’s own canon, not in the context of the actual real life people involved. Any mention of Arin and Dan will be about the characters they play, not the actual dudes themselves. 

So basically, like the title states, my whole theory is that 10 Minute Power Hour is a once famous YouTube channel’s desperate attempt to stay relevant and profitable. To prove that, I want to start by talking about the production quality. It intentionally comes across as very, very non-professional and amateurish. This gave me the sense that it doesn’t have a huge budget behind it, this being further confirmed for me by the actual content. So far, we’ve gotten episodes about them building Legos, baking with a toy oven, making paper airplanes, fighting with toy robots, and making candy with a kid alchemy set. These are incredibly cheap and easy subjects for videos, especially when you compare them to other similar kinds of YouTube channels about personalities competing in challenges. Most recently, in the alchemy episode, Arin mentions in his rant to Tucker about Danny that he bought all this stuff at Toys R Us. I don’t think I need to explain the relevance of that, but for those that aren’t aware, Toys R Us went bankrupt, and a lot of the stores had ridiculous sales to get rid of stock, with a lot of toys being sold for up to 70% off. Considering the show is on a budget, it doesn’t seem out of the realm of possibility that Arin went and bought a bunch of grossly discounted toys in the hopes of being able to use them for more content. This explains why he’s so anal about Dan mistreating the toys and mentioning how much he paid for them in doing so. The paper airplane and baking episodes is them resorting to using free activities as ideas for episode premises, since they mentioned the oven they’re using was given to them. Even them being careful about the logo on the oven might be attributed to how little money they have, and quite literally not being able to afford being hit with a copyright strike. 

So why use just tape? Why not blur it? I think that has to do with my original point about the amateurish quality, and I think that’s solely because of Tucker. Again, I’m sure actual Tucker is fantastic at his job, but his character of Tucker is very obviously not. Sure, he knows how to set up cameras and splice together footage, but the biggest indicators to me that this dude doesn’t know what he’s doing are the scene where Arin yells at him for browsing reddit instead of working, and the fact that all his text is in oddly colored comic sans. There’s also the few times in the alchemy episode where Arin mentions how long it took Tucker to set up some of the set, meaning he might be bad at that too, or at the very least still learning. It might actually be possible that Tucker is a rookie hire they got for cheap, and it would explain them occasionally forgetting his name and his low productivity. 

It also strikes me as odd how empty the office is in the paper airplanes episode. In regular Grumps, every glance we’ve gotten of the office always showed a lot of people at work on their own projects, but in this it was eerily empty. A lot of the Amiibo Wall is empty, which I’m sure in actuality has always been like that, but does give off the sense that it was once full and Arin might have sold a lot of it to stay afloat. There’s also what seems to be a lot of boxes in the room Arin storms into during once scene, which might be them packing ahead of time in case they get evicted. The only other person we actually see during this is Tucker, who is alone in a room with at least two other computers that presumably once had employees. An office this big set up for that many employees means the channel must’ve been huge in its heyday, but has had to let go a lot of its staff since then. It’s this same episode that had the whole conversation between Tucker and Arin about the channel having lost a lot of viewers and them needing to do something about it, which is what launched me into this whole theory in the first place. The fact that this scene was left in again points to how bad Tucker is at his job. 

I think this also might explain the weird antagonism between Arin and Dan that has thrown so many people off. Arin is very obviously desperately trying to put on a good show to get back those high subscription rates they used to have, while Dan seems to be aware of how dire their situation is and has made peace with it, coasting along and not giving a shit until the ship finally sinks. This is why Arin has that long rant about him in the alchemy episode, and why he goes to great lengths to hide it rather than confront Dan about it, presumably because he’s afraid losing Dan could end up being the final nail in the coffin. 

Again, this is all just a theory I came to after thinking about this silly show for far too long. I’ll admit it’s not airtight, like I don’t have any solid explanations for Vernon showing up and that one intern with the multi-tool. But I do think it’s a fun context to watch the show with, and who knows? Maybe Arin and Dan still have a storytelling itch that they’ve been meaning to scratch since the YouTube Red thing got canceled. Also, this is my literal first Reddit post after years of browsing, so I’m sorry if I fucked something up somehow. "

Do you get this feeling?,some_quirkyname,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8g7g6i/please_help_do_you_get_this_feeling/,"I've been struggling with maladaptive perfectionism for quite some time. It ruined my college work. I've been struggling to cope with all the overdue assignments. We have a compulsory internship for the next year. I was supposed to apply for it two months back. I still haven't finished the portfolio to apply. I've been at home for nearly 2 months trying to finish it. I'm making progress but too slow to apply on time. And during this process, I couldn't focus on college work, and have not been to college in two months. 
I've had really rough times, countless breakdowns, suicidal thoughts. I've been doing well past two days, working on it keeping my worries aside. But today it caught up with me, when I learnt that I was the only one yet to apply for an internship and that everyone has submitted their assignments. 
I'm having another breakdown today. But for the first time it feels different. I feel calm and detached. As though I'm going to leave all of this soon. I just have this feeling that I won't be here much longer. It's not dissociation, I've experienced that and that it very different.

I met Nick when I was 17. I fell hard for him and so did he. Nick was my first serious relationship and pretty much exactly how I imagined my dream man since I was little. On top of being crazy attractive we had the same interests, love for animals and future plans. 

We've been together for 1.5years when I got accepted for an internship fro half a year in another country. Before I left we talked about moving in together as soon as I was back and generally talking about our future together. When I left things turned bad. Due to different time zones and me being in an area with almost no reception anywere close to where I was, we would be able to skype or text maybe about once a week. At home Nick was in the army and also had a lot of trouble with his parents that he still lived with. So I was basically having the time of my life while he had the exact opposite. 3 months in he told me that he needed a break and wanted to cut contact for a while. I blamed myself for it since I couldn't be there for him and cursed myself for not making more of an effort to talk to him more often and longer. A month after that he reached out to me again and we started talking. I thought things were going uphill again and that we could fix our problems as soon as I came home. But I was wrong. 

When I came back he was an entirely different person. Cold, desinterested and rude even. I was shocked since that was not the person that I fell in love with. I still wanted to save what was left about our relationship but he had none of it and broke up with me in June 2017. Saying he neede to be alone and figure himself out. Even though I saw it coming, I was absolutly heartbroken.

We stayed in touch. I just thought that it was another one of those breaks and if I waited long enough he would just come around and we would be together again. We texted every now and then and I felt like he still cared about me. We decided to meet up in December 2017. When we met, we talked a lot about our relationship. Why things turned out the way they did and how life is going for the both of us. I asked him if he thought if we could be together again but he only gave me a very vage answer. Saying he didn't want to think about the 'if' since we were currently living a couple of hours apart and that it would basically be too much effort. At the end of the meeting he kissed me. It was totally out of the blue but it was so beautiful. This got my hopes up again and this time to an entierly different level. So I started to text him again but he seemed cold and uninterested. So I called him to talk about what happened. When I mentioned the kiss he just said that's just something that happend and that he couldn't see us together at the moment because of our living situations. He said it like the kiss was a f\*cking accident. That was my breaking point and I decided to cut contact. This time for good. I was angry and it was the first time that I didn't feel like I wanted him back. 

Then in January 2018 I met Tom \(21M\). We started dating and get along like a house on fire. Being with him is a whole new experience for me and entirely different to what i had with Nick. I stopped thinking about Nick and started to really invest myself into my new relationship. Things are going great with Tom and I really start to see myself being with him longterm. 

So here comes the reason for this novel. 

Tom has been gone for a week for work, so I decided to clear out some of my things. Then I found an item that Nick gave to me on our first anniversary. That item meant a lot to me. And suddenly all the feelings were back. It just hit me like a truck. I've been feeling miserable the last couple days. The first time in 5 months I wasn't sure that if Nick would contact me and ask for another chance, that I could say no. 

I feel like I'm betraying Tom and that makes me even more sad and miserable. I really tried to hate Nick and forget him and our time together. But I miss him. Or at least I miss the hyperthetical future that I've already planned out for us when we were still together. 

I don't have anyone that I trust enough to talk to about that. Any advice would be welcome.

Tl;dr: Can't get over my Ex and it makes me feel like I am betraying my current BF."
8g80kx,21,2018-05-01,I'm an 18 year old incoming freshman CS student that's going to be making 25-40k part time while in uni... more money than sense. What do I do?,stupid18yearold,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8g80kx/im_an_18_year_old_incoming_freshman_cs_student/,"I'm going to be making as much as our household income in a few months and I'm very scared.

I don't know what to buy, invest in, or save. My plan right now is to put 50% of my check into my dad's savings account (who I trust) that I cannot touch unless he allows me to take it back. I'm very irresponsible with money and I like to live lavish and spend good money. I did an internship last year, made ~12k that summer and blew it all in 3 months. If you ask me what I bought, I wouldn't be able to answer. I didn't even buy anything major like a car or TV or console.


I'm very lost and don't know what to do. It's good money for an 18 year old student but it's really not that much. I won't have to pay for tuition or residence because I got a full ride. Right now, I have $15k set aside to finance a 0% financing car I found that I like. Is this unwise? A car is necessary where I live when I get into uni.  

Sorry for the incoherence, I've stayed up all night thinking about this. Thank you personal finance...

edit: Also, I'm guaranteed employment and potential salary increases all 4 years as long as I don't fuck up. My parents don't have any loans other than a mortgage with 80k on it. I plan on waiting until the very end of their mortgage when there's 10-30k or so left and paying it off for them!!!"

The only thing I'm not excited about is the idea of housing. As I've been searching, I've noticed the limited options and high rent prices. I may or may not have a car with me, so I am trying to find something as close to downtown or somewhere with access to public transportation.

I'm not sure if posting here will bring me any luck, but I would love to make connections with folks before I move out there anyway!

Need advice,ahmayday,publichealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/8g9des/graduating_with_a_bachelors_in_public_health/,"Hi! I'm graduating with my degree in public health administration in May and I feel hopeless about job prospects. I am planning to attend grad school, but I am not sure what I want to go into for grad school. Hence why I am looking for a job right now.
I have volunteer experience with hospice and I managed to get an (unpaid) internship with an organization that educates immigrants about sexual abuse. 
Most of the jobs I find require experience working 1-2+ years in an office/medical setting. I technically have that with my volunteer work, but I haven't been able to get any interviews at all. I spoke to the career center at my university and had my resume critiqued. I've already spoken to the places I volunteer at, but they do not have any openings. I feel defeated. 
Luckily I have a part-time minimum wage job that keeps me steady, but I would still prefer a full-time job that is related to my major. 
I'm just looking for tips and advice on how to proceed or what I should do. How can I make myself more attractive to employers? How did you land the job that you're in right now? What did you do to get your foot in the door?"

Quite a top ten we got here!

To no one's surprise, Ariana Grande snatches our wigs as well as her first #1 spot on the Hot 50 as 'No Tears Left to Cry' debuts at #1. With an impressive grand total of 4,739.5 points on its debut, this makes **Ariana the first artist to accumulate 4k points in a single week**. She joins Taylor Swift in achieving this record as she was the first artist to accumulate 3k points in a single week back in September 4 last year with 'Look What You Made Me Do'. LWYMMD got its Gold certification on its second week so expect NTLTC to follow suit next week. The song was very close to getting a Gold certification on its debut week but hey, maybe next time! Ariana also managed to have 'Into You' reach a new peak at #18, making the song this week's biggest gain.

Drake's 'Nice For What' regains back to its peak at #2. Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa's 'One Kiss' also managed to increase one spot from last week to #3.

Nicki Minaj's singles are still in the top ten, with 'Chun-Li' being the highest-charting song this time at #4 while 'Barbie Tingz' charts at #7.

Cardi B's collaboration with Bad Bunny and J Balvin 'I Like It' regains 2 spots to #5. Anne-Marie's nostalgic track '2002' debuts at #6. Sugarland's collab with Taylor 'Babe' debuts at #8. Kimbra's 'Lightyears' debuts at the bottom of the top ten. Kimbra's 'Top of the World' is also this week's highest re-entry at #15.

Lastly, with Janelle Monae's latest LP *Dirty Computer* eligible to chart next week, 'Pynk' remains strong on its third week at #9.

Unfortunately for Florence + The Machine, her single 'Sky Full of Song' takes this week's biggest decline, losing 43 spots to #49.

* **Highest Debut:** #1. Ariana Grande - No Tears Left To Cry
* **Highest Re-Entry:** #15. Kimbra - Top Of The World 
* **Biggest Gain:** #18. Ariana Grande - Into You (+31) 
* **Biggest Decline:** #49. Florence + The Machine - Sky Full Of Song (-43)
* **Ariana Grande is the first artist to accumulate 4k points in a single week.**

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

Ill start at the begining, it was summer of 2017 i attempted to kill myself for the first time, i was just sick of life for many reasons. I started getting followed by a psychiatrist and psychologist and things were getting better with my life so i stoped taking the meds i was supost to take and stoped going to the therapy and ofc i tried to commit suicide again in november and again this year in february, i got intern in a psychiatric hospital for a month and now im on a thing its like a school but with people like me where u do activities and therapy .
And right now im just scared, my mental health is getting worse cause of drugs and all the meds i took when i tried to commit suicide,im taking all the meds they give me doing everything they tell me telling everything i have on my mind but still not getting better im actually getting even more depressed then what i already was i just want to kill myself again, my suicidal thoughts are coming in again my desire to cut myself and burn myself is getting bigger, and the thing i dont get is that im getting all the best treatment my country as to give but still not getting better not even a bit."
8gbdcx,4,2018-05-01,Master's Student feeling lost and axious - any wise words?,PossiblyNotUseless,labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/8gbdcx/masters_student_feeling_lost_and_axious_any_wise/,"Hey everyone, this is a bit embarrassing so I am using a throwaway account. Sorry if this get's a bit verbose, TL;DR at the end.

I am a Master's Student in a biochemistry program in Germany and in need of some guidance. I have two left hands, so I am somewhat useless in the lab - all my chemistry lab rotations were absolutely disastrous; in my molecular biology labs, I managed to scrape by. However, I gradually became more interested in computers and decided to reorient myself in the direction of bioinformatics/crystallography (the computational side). I am currently an intern in a group working in that field and somewhat disheartened: Everyone seems so vastly ahead of me that I don't even know where to start catching up, I have problems understanding the software &amp; documentation I am to use and feel like I am getting so much on the other's nerves that I dread showing up in the office.

Basically, I feel like am not good enough to make it in a job in any of the disciplines my degree touches upon and feel like I can't catch up. It also feels like the direction I'm trying to take has only very few connections to my actual course of studies this far - which means I kinda feel both very underprepared and like I wasted years studying the *slightly* wrong thing. 

I'm afraid of the final Master's exam, of my thesis, of graduating and at the same time of being a failure because of taking MUCH too long for my degree.

8gc7hz,3,2018-05-01,College triggers my depression,Cedenwar,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8gc7hz/college_triggers_my_depression/,"About a year ago, I started experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. I was unable to pay attention in classes, often skipped and just stayed in bed all day, and every time I tried going to college I felt absolutely terrible. I don't know how to explain it, but besides feeling like crying I felt like there was something in the pit of my stomach the whole time. Like that moment when the roller coaster drops, except I was stuck in it for hours. I finished that semester and tried to start the next one, but found I couldn't go on, so I dropped it and looked for treatment, which is when I was diagnosed. Since then, I've been taking an antidepressant and doing therapy. It's been a bit over six months, I think.

This semester I decided to try going back to college, since things had been looking up. While my depression was still there, it was manageable and I had a lot less symptoms. For the first two weeks everything went ok, but then the whole thing started up again. So I stopped going to classes, and per my therapist's suggestion spoke to my professors about it. They understood and said I could try just doing the assignments and taking the exams, without attending classes. I got an internship which is everything I wanted, and I'm loving it.

But now we get to the problem. I keep putting off the assignments and the studying for college. Every time I think about it, I get anxious. The first deadline of the semester is the day after tomorrow, and my depression hit full force yesterday. I haven't been able to even focus at my internship, and I feel bad all the time. Today is a holiday where I live, so I've been home all day, and haven't been able to do anything productive. My housemates have been studying since they woke up, which makes me feel even worse. I haven't even been able to focus on the projects I want to do for myself, and I've avoided thinking about college all day.

I hate feeling like this. And my next therapy appointment is only next week, so until then I've got to handle it alone. Part of me wants to disappear and come back when everythig is sorted out. Another part of me wants to drop out of college and just let life work itself out, but I feel like if I do I'll be risking my future. I'm feeling so stuck."

I have been putting my best foot forward, literally pulling all nighters, so I can make my program to work. I fucked up on the midterm and our code review didn't go so well.

I have the second lowest grade in the class. I am going to continue to do what I can do with regards to the final, final project, and possible extra credit, but other than that is it worth going to the professor?

I want to go talk to the professor in hopes I can still get a C so I can just graduate since my internship is the job I have lined up after I graduate and family making plans to come to my graduation. I am afraid the professor is just going to belittle me, even though its not like I haven't been trying. I know he won't believe how much effort I put into things.

So what would be the best thing to do in this situation? Should I let him make offers or should I be aggressive and ask if there is more I can do? Should I let him insult me or should I defend myself? For example he requires people to answer questions in class but I am actually timid so I ended up not answering any."

Bit of backstory : I've just completed my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering and got an internship at one of AMD's rival companies.

It is a dream come true for me as since I was a child I always wanted to work with companies that made PC hardware. 

Since I'm a CSE grad, the work I do is mostly software related and I barely get to touch/design the meaty hardware. And for a curious person like me who always keeps asking how things work and easily gets deep into that rabbit hole, I feel I have to study either ECE/EEE (Electrical and Communicatons or Electrical Engineering) (i.e do my masters in either of the two) to understand more about how CPU/GPUs tick.

This means making a switch from a CSE background to a Electrical one. Is it a good decision to do such a switch? I know it's going to be hard and I will have to work my arse off but I kinda believe my curiosity will keep me motivated.

So the question I have is, what's the better one out of ECE and EEE for a Computer Hardware related career?

Also any other advice is gladly appreciated.

Thanks!"
8ge4uq,232,2018-05-01,The story of a neckbeard. Me.,duckduckboomerang,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/8ge4uq/the_story_of_a_neckbeard_me/,"Standard plea for leniency from a first time poster, long time lurker.

I've been reading this subreddit for some time and it's made me reflect on my own past. With the clarity of hindsight, I've come to realise I may have been varying degrees of neckbeard throughout my life. I thought I'd share this story because it may be interesting for people to know what it's like from inside the metaphorical beard.

Growing up (and even now) I loved all the nerd stuff. Anime, games, Magic the Gathering, Warhammer and so on. I attended an all boys high school and never really gave thought to meeting girls till my senior years. I had a tight knit group of male friends who had shared interests so I never really ventured out of this circle. Looking back, this meant I never had to develop any of those all important social skills and coping mechanisms to deal with the world outside my bubble.

After graduating high school and starting university to study engineering, I started meeting people outside my little bubble and this is the first time I am in close proximity to girls on a regular basis. My 18 year old self at the time thought it was not a big deal. My thought process was something along the lines of ""girls are people and my high school dude-friends are people. I can deal with my dude-friends so I can deal with girls"".

For the most part this was true. I was an awkward, heavily-overweight and unkempt guy who would invade conversations to tell people ""facts"" on everything but I was basically a functional human being. I managed to keep my shit together when it came to study, getting employment, paying my taxes and the rest of the usual mundane adult shit. The problem was when it came to girls I liked the look of and wanted to date. 

My standard dating process was as follows. I would strike up a conversation with them and ask to meet up for a coffee/drink/something and this would work more often than not. I guess I came off as pretty harmless so the girls would give me a chance. After the first uncomfortable not-a-date where I would spend the entire time talking about the things I enjoyed, AKA Anime, games, ETC, I would just latch onto the girl and basically follow them around, lavishing awkward gifts on them until I felt they were suitably impressed then I would confess my feelings to them in one giant text-wall SMS. This is exactly as awkward and cringe inducing as you are currently imagining. It also worked about as well as you would expect.

The response all this elicited from the girls is the dependable ""I like you as a friend"" and all of its many variants. To their credit I think some of them meant it and they did try to keep in touch but the moment I got this line from them I would immediately sever ties with them because I thought ""why bother maintaining a friendship, the point was to get a girlfriend"" or sometimes ""that bitch just strung me along for free stuff"". This shit continued for *years*, well into my 20's. I'm not sure why I settled on this as the best course of action to try and date girls. I think it might be to do with my only touchstones for dealing with the opposite sex being Anime, TV and Internet dating guides. 

I think the reason it went on for so long despite the abject failure of it all is some abstract belief that if I met the *RIGHT* girl, all of this would work. Also I didn't understand a basic human concept. People won't tell you negative things about you to your face. These girls, being nice people, didn't want to hurt my feelings so nobody said ""hey, cut this shit out, it's awkward and that's not how you go about things"".

I never had an epiphany moment, it came as incremental changes to my life which dragged me out of my rut. The first was losing weight. I'm not entirely sure what prompted it. I've had people tell me my entire life some variant of ""you need to lose weight, it's bad for your health"" or ""you will find the dating more forgiving if you lost some weight"". None of that motivated me but after graduating university, I remember thinking to myself ""I wonder what it would be like to not be this fat. I wonder how the other side lives"". Over the course of 8 months after I graduated I concentrated on eating better and shed a lot of my weight.

The second was my job. I had landed a pretty decent engineering job that would rotate its interns through all the areas of the business and one area in particular, they put you with the operations teams so you get to put your hands on tools and do the work they do. I was *fucking woeful* at doing actual work. This came as a shock to me because I was one of those people who believed in my own supreme logic. I truly believed that if I understood the logic behind how something worked, the actual act of doing the task was simple peasant work and better left to lesser beings. As I worked with the teams I began to learn some semblance of humility and I began to listen to people. I began to appreciate that things are always harder than they look.

Finally, I began to open up to some of my close friends about my failures in dating and sought their advice. Up to this point, I would always just tell my friends about how great my dating life was and how many girls I was seeing. After I swallowed my pride and asked for advice, I learnt a lot about social norms I didn't realise were a thing and a lot of myths I took as social norms were dispelled.

As I write the story now, I'm 30, married and working in a job I rather enjoy. I cringe when I look back at the things I did but it's done and all that can be done is to try and learn something from the mistakes. Thanks for reading, I hope that was interesting for some of you.

I'm about 6 weeks removed from my meniscus tear surgery and I've wanted to get myself some CBD vape juice to help with my pain treatment and inflammation. The pain isn't too bad anymore but it's still noticeable enough that it worries me. The reason I'd prefer vape juice is I've also struggled quite a bit staying away from nicotine and I think it's the smoking habit that pulls me back into it whenever I try to quit. I made a terrible decision to get myself a juul 2 weeks ago and I've found myself unable to let it go. Prior to my surgery I was training for a marathon as motivation to clean up my diet and help get me out of a bad seasonal depression bout I had over the winter. After my surgery I fell back into my rut (I think my dog running away the night before surgery made me relapse even worse than l was before). Before I turn this into a pity party I wanted to ask: 


1.) Can CBD help with my depression? (aside from getting me off the nicotine which I know would help)


2.) Can CBD vape juice negatively affect my cardio? I know inhaling anything into your lungs is bound to do so, but as an avid mma fan I know the Diaz brothers are able to smoke by the truckload and still somehow have arguably the **best** cardio in the game (also feel free to use my juul as a baseline of comparison I want all the motivation to quit I can have atm).  


3.) Can CBD give me ""mental fog""? I recently got an engineering internship and absolutely have to remain sharp at my workplace. I've always struggled staying focused on tasks at hand.  


4.) What are some CBD vape brands y'all would recommend? I know which ones to stay away from thanks to the FAQs section but I'm hoping not to get price gauged. I've seen bottles go from $30 up to $100 and am hoping to get some clarity into the price disparity here. 
 

Thanks in advance to anyone who responds and I welcome all personal testimonies as well. Hope my first post isn't too bad a read :)

8gegs8,0,2018-05-01,Question about Income Support program...,jdoe99999,Calgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/8gegs8/question_about_income_support_program/,"So I never dreamed of getting welfare but unexpected slice of life happened to me and I'd like to get one as an insurance. Long story short, I'm in a position where I have to move out of my folks' place (financial decision for retirement), and I haven't finished school yet. I was hoping finding intern job related to my field would be easy, but it's not at all. Most want some previous experience or specific skills that are not covered in school. Ideally I would have some coding portfolio, but I was busy juggling with school and part time works and didn't managed to make one. It's much easier on employer's eyes when I have a pretty solid portfolio. Something I will focus on in my spare time.

I am fortunate enough to find a relatively cheap place to rent (below $500/month with basic utilities), and I have some savings to keep me alive for around 3 months. After that though, I'm homeless. Hence I've been trying to find a job but it has been surprisingly hard so far. Apart from my intern job, I've been aiming for data entry-related jobs (seemed pretty straight forward and I crunch numbers and organize data all the time), but no replies so far (been about a week or 2 so I assume they said no). 

So as an insurance, I'm applying Income Support program. 

Background:
- I am not qualified for AISH; I have no mental or physical disabilities. Just can't find the job that's all :(
- I have some savings in my bank account but I can confirm I'm not working atm
- no car. Literally just bringing my personal belongings. 
- no urgent medical condition, but I rely on some prescription drugs to treat my dry skin.

Few questions:
- I'm told once approved, it takes 7 business days for funding to come through. How long would the process be roughly?

- Roughly what income is the limit before subsidy must be forfeited?

- How much could I expect monthly?

- Is there anything I should know about?

I'll be bringing my 30 day bank statement + lease agreement

I currently live with my parents while finishing grad school. I am in my final year of grad school and I have plans to move out and get my own place once I find a job. I've had a difficult time getting a job, though, probably because of the bad job market.

My Dad works in this field but I can't say he's particularly popular with a lot of people. I've told him repeatedly, and in no uncertain terms, that I prefer to make the job search on my own and that I don't want his help with it. This is because he has ""helped"" in the past and I've found it to be very stressful and not fruitful.

I learned today that he has written up a ""resume"" for me based on the pieces of information I've given about my internships and other employment, and has been sending it to people he sees as potential employers in the state—some big ones. I learned this when I talked to a potential employer and they were familiar with my name because of the ""emails about me"" they've gotten from [my dad's name]. I was very upset about this and did something I shouldn't have done, and searched up my name in his work email (which I have access to for unrelated and somewhat complex circumstances). I saw many weird emails he sent where he talked about me, sent this resume, talked about weird personal stories about me, and said things about my job search and emotions that I shared with him in confidence.

I found out from my Mom that he also wrote several people at my school, which he has donated to in the past. They had meetings without me present and discussed my grades, personality, and everything. These people discussed information with him about my grades, academic performance, and interviewing skills, like an after-school conference. They apparently knew that I wasn't aware of these meetings and didn't want him to have them, and met with him anyway.

I confronted him about all of them and he screamed at me that I ""always keep him out of the loop,"" that I don't know ""how to defer to his seventy years of experience,"" and that he is on my side and I'm always acting like a jerk and not sharing any information with him.

I'm feeling very, very upset about this and completely out of control. I'm very upset especially that he met with people at my school and they talked about my personal information. I can't talk to my family or friends about it and I am completely lost.

tl;dr: My Dad is sending out emails with my personal information and academic information in them to employers without my knowledge or consent. He's met with people at my school without my knowledge, consent, or presence. What do I do? Please help.

Statisticile arată că, din 334 de persoane pe zi dispărute în anul 2017 din populaţie, 208 au emigrat.

În domeniul transporturilor ziua statistică arată astfel: numărul total al înmatriculărilor de vehicule pentru transportul pasagerilor a fost de 1.918, din care mopede şi motociclete 15, **autoturisme 1.895**, iar autobuze şi microbuze 8. Numărul autovehiculelor pentru mărfuri înmatriculate în 2017 a fost de 311, din care autocamioane 36, iar ca număr de remorci şi semiremorci a fost de 77.

Din datele INS rezultă că, la sfârşitul anului 2016, întreprinderille din industrie, comerţ, construcţii şi servicii de piaţă totalizau **500.428 de companii**. Acestea realizat împreună o cifră de afaceri de 3.383 de miliarde de lei pe zi şi un profit de 193,5 milioane de lei pe zi. Ceea ce înseamnă că în medie, o companie din România a avut vânzări de 6,76 milioane de lei pe zi, obţinând un profit de 386.000 de lei pe zi.

Radiografia unei zile statistice în agricultură arată că fermierii sacrifică în abatoare un număr de 1.857 de vaci, **15.967 de porci**, peste 20.000 de oi, 715.147 de păsări pe zi şi colectează aproape 17 milioane de ouă pe zi. Tot fermierii mai obţin 131,8 milioane de hectolitri de lapte pe zi.

În privinţa sectorului contrucţiilor de locuinţe, românii sunt harnici, mai reiese din statisticile oficiale. Astfel că în 2017 s-a construit un număr total de 146 de locuinţe pe zi din care 66 în mediul rural şi 80 în mediul urban. **Statul a construit în anul precedent 4 case pe zi**, celelalte 141 fiind construite de investitori privaţi.


Comerţul international se prezintă în statisticile noastre cu exporturi de 62,6 miliarde de euro pe an, ceea ce înseamnă 974.603 euro pe zi. La importuri, acestea au fost de 75,6 miliarde de euro, ceea ce înseamnă 1,02 milioane de euro pe zi. Interesant este că doar **mâncarea este la import de peste 18.000 de euro pe zi**, în timp ce exporturile însumează doar 13.500 de euro pe zi.

Per ansamblu, România a obţinut un Produs Intern Brut (PIB) de 858,3 miliarde de lei în 2017, ceea ce înseamnă o medie de 2,3 milioane de lei pe zi. Pentru a obţine acest PIB, agricultorii produc marfă în valoare de 102,802 lei pe zi, industriaşii 568.617 lei pe zi, constructorii 138.191 lei pe zi, prestatorii de servicii (transporturi, comerţ, turism) 438.227 de lei pe zi şi informaticienii 120.740. În acelaşi timp, în sectorul bănci şi asigurări se obţin 65.730 de lei pe zi, iar din tranzacţiile imobiliare se obţin 180.500 de lei pe zi. **Pe partea de utilizare, gospodăriile populaţiei participă la PIB cu 1,45 miliarde de lei pe zi (cel mai mare aport)**, în timp ce investitorii alocă 573.986 de lei pe zi. Statul, la rândul său, consumă 277.128 lei pe zi, iar din impozite şi taxe se colectează la buget 221.035 lei pe zi.

Cum arată bugetul de stat în această zi statistică? Potrivit datelor raportate de Ministerul Finanţelor Publice, la buget se colectează venituri de 251,8 miliarde de lei pe an, ceea ce înseamnă 689.915 lei pe zi, însă se cheltuiesc 276 miliarde de lei pe an, ceea ce înseamnă 756.383 de lei pe zi. **Firmele plătesc un impozit pe profit de 40.361 de lei pe zi, angajaţii plătesc impozite pe salarii de 82.583 de lei pe zi,** iar comercianţii colectează TVA de 146.693 de lei pe zi şi accize de 71.408 lei pe zi.

8gfcz0,0,2018-05-02,Advice in finding a decent job...,jdoe99999,Calgary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/8gfcz0/advice_in_finding_a_decent_job/,"I'm in the middle of college (compsci), and I'm struggling to find a decent job. I'm in a situation where I have to move out and I need some steady cash flow coming my way as soon as I can. It's surprisingly hard to find a job. I've been applying mostly for IT-related intern positions and data entry-related jobs but I haven't heard back from them so I assume my attempt failed (1-2 weeks since I applied). I'm trying to also find min. wage jobs to ensure I don't end up homeless. Ideally somewhere reasonably close to my area or near LRTs since I won't have access to car anymore ugh.

Any tips/advice? Trying to avoid labor jobs as I'm not in best of my shape (I've hurt my back from time to time when I used to work out and I won't be able to afford major medical bills so trying to avoid physically intensive jobs)"
8gfe1v,2,2018-05-02,Am I Naive?,Nyoibo,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8gfe1v/am_i_naive/,"I'll try to spare my life story but essentially I graduated college about 5 years ago and I have done very little with my degree. I had an internship during college for a few months, I just had another temporary full time position for 2 months last year in the fall. Now I'm back to working for peanuts at a part time job and living at home.

So last year around the start of Summer, before my Autumn job, I spent a few months trying to learn programming on my own. I have a Bachelors degree and took a lot of computer classes, so I'm not completely lost on programming or IT. So I start spending the time I'm not working trying to improve myself. Doing tutorials and then trying to apply them by making projects.

I could explain what exactly I did but long story short I spent nearly my whole summer anxious and upset nearly every day practicing tutorials for a few languages and trying so hard to get them. I wanted to at least make something I could be kind of proud of. In the end I made a few Ruby projects that amount to what you'd probably see in a college course beginner's example, that is to say nothing very impressive. Then I also managed to barely make a web page from scratch using HTML, and CSS. That page was also not very good, heck I knew it was crap because even though it looks okay to me I know nothing about modern web design practices and such.

So anyway, it killed me inside that I tried so hard for so long and it wound up feeling like a waste of time. I so badly wanted it, I worked through my feelings of wanting to quit and feeling like an imposter all the while knowing that if I did it would be admitting I have given in and I will never have a decent career and college was a waste. It got so bad I had to start seeing a councilor about my dark thoughts.

Anyway, getting that autumn job was a great boost to my feelings of self worth. Honestly, I didn't know too well what I was doing but I showed up every day and gave it my all so I feel good about the experience. The fact they didn't keep me meant that I felt like a failure, and soon after I was felting thinking, ""What now?""

Well that was October, and now it's May. My mother has been in the hospital since January of mental illness, it's been very hard on my family. I have basically been taking her place for the chores around the house and that has helped me feel a little less worthless. It also let me relax my mind about finding a job since for one thing I can't move out until she comes back because it would be unfair to my mom and dad to do so right now while this is happening. However, she comes back home in two days. Not only am I stressed out she's coming back because I was getting used to the fact she was gone but I also know she will put more pressure on me about finding a job and such.

Also, now that she's coming back I have no excuse. Now I have really big and bold plans to move to California. Yes I know, everyone has the same opinion on that state, it's too expensive. I'm fairly convinced that the expensive areas are those bay areas and the coastal cities. Yes I agree those can potentially be wallet breaking unless you're a big shot. However, there are many reasons I want to move out there not least of which is my boyfriend who I want to be close to. Actually getting to hold him would be good for my health I think. 

So I keep applying for jobs in California from a place on the other side of the country. I go to indeed and look up what I think is within' my skill set and what translates from my previous job. To be clear, previously I was working at a hospital as a Information Services Technician. Basically, I was apart of the IT Department in fixing/setting up devices.

I have steadily applied to over 200 jobs in the last few months, picking out the ones that seem reasonable in pay and something I can either do or come to learn quickly. I have received one reply with someone who was interested. After a phone interview they said they would be moving forward without me. That was pretty disheartening but I kept trying. I re-wrote my resume and made it much more in-depth without being overly detailed. I use Indeed to try and find jobs, I have had a LinkedIn account for a long time, my profiles are all public so anyone can search me, and it just doesn't matter. I've even tried applying to tech companies who have a position requiring more knowledge and experience than I have and asking them if they have a need for someone to take a more junior position, you know in an effort to show some initiative and stand out? Doesn't matter, I never hear anything back 90% of the time.

I don't know. I'm still trying to apply and stuff but I'm still here. I turned 28 last month and I'm so tired of just feeling worthless and like it's just never going to happen. I know life isn't always fair, things don't always go the way we plan, dreams die. I've lowered my expectations exponentially to the point where I'm much closer to reality, I think. But gosh, I have never put so much effort into trying to achieve something for so long and it just blowing up in my face so hard that I want to give up. Spending that summer trying to do something and working past my constant desire to just quit was so incredibly hard I can't even describe it. What was it for? It didn't do anything for me and I feel I may as well have stuck to just playing games and rotting my brain with more youtube videos.

I just feel like I can't win. Also, I know 28 isn't really old but I'm starting to feel like for how little I understand there are college and probably even high school students out of school who live in California who will always be chosen before me. So I just constantly feel like everything I do is a waste of time. I know if I don't try I will definitely never leave this place, but even when I do try I seem to get no positive results.

So am I naive? Should I just give it up and stop applying to California? I don't have debt, I have enough saved I could live in California for a few months until I find a job if I really have to. However, that's literally all the money I've managed to save. I know that's a better position than a lot of people but I don't have the confidence in my ability to hold a job. It seems I don't even have the capacity to learn or retain knowledge anymore. I think anxiety and depression has caused me to lose my ability to process my thinking correctly or actively retain anything. It's like a vicious cycle or something."

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

8gftr7,2,2018-05-02,"I’m being pushed away by my boyfriend his depression, he now wants to end our relationship... Please give me some insights!",-Rapunzel,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8gftr7/im_being_pushed_away_by_my_boyfriend_his/,"Not sure if I \(30F\) can post in this subreddit if it is about my boyfriend his depression, if not please tell me, but I couldn’t find a subreddit specifically for partners of a depressed person.

My boyfriend got depressed a little over 4 years ago, which lasted about 3 years. His previous relationship ended because of this depression, she ended the relationship, he didn’t want to break up, he still regrets losing her, she was the love of his life. However, after their breakup he got better. He says that breaking up was probably one of the reasons he got better \(other reasons were not having major obligations workwise or studywise and starting to make music again, which is the other love of his life\).

A few months after he got better I met him and we are now in a relationship a little over a year. He has never been much of a talker and he has a lot of difficulties expressing the feelings he has for me. Still, from the start he opened up to me about his troubled childhood and the things he struggled with at that moment. He said that even though it is not like him it felt good to share these things with me, even to date he says I am the only person in his life he has a meaningful deeper emotional bond with. He is not on good terms with his family and he says he cannot open up about these things to his friends because they only talk about superficial stuff like beer. To be honest, I think his friends would listen, but he doesn’t want to tell them/feels ashamed to/does not want to be seen as weak/thinks he always should be able to deal with things by himself/etc. In the past he dealt with very troubled situations, and he was always able to cope with it and take care of himself, it made him stronger, and it made him proud of himself that he could deal with it by himself. But I think the coping mechanisms he developed then \(e.g. withdrawing/escaping from emotional situations\) kind of backfire now, he cannot open up to people and is incapable of asking/accepting help from others.

About half a year into our relationship he slowly slipped back into his depression. He feels so miserable and out of control every single day, like his world is falling apart and there is nothing he can do to stop it. Except for making music, he doesn’t enjoy anything anymore, everything feels like a burden/pressure to him, the smallest things hit him like a ton of bricks, and his body also suffers greatly from his mental state. I started to look for information about depression, to be able to understand what he is going through, I’ve also read a lot of your posts in this subreddit, thank you so much for sharing your stories so openly! It helped me a lot in understanding why he behaves the way he does. I guess I will never truly understand since I’m not depressed, but I think I come close to understanding. I know I cannot ‘fix’ him or cheer him up, that is also not what I’m trying to, I just want to be there for him, listen to him without judging, understand him, show that I care for him and love him.

His friends and family don’t know about his depression. He is always wearing a ‘mask’ when he is with other people \(except with me\). When I’m with him when he is with other people, it is like his depression doesn’t even exist, he seems happy, he is playful and making jokes, people love him. But I know it takes all his energy to be like that. He fakes it like a fucking pro! He told me that he feels like I’m the only person he can truly be himself with, and I’m glad he feels safe with me not to wear his mask, but I sometimes secretly wish he would once in a while make the effort for me too to pretend to be enthusiastic. I know this is a very selfish thought, but I only get to see his depression. At the same time I’m so super proud of him that he goes to his internship almost every day and shows up at work, he manages to keep his house clean, and to keep doing stuff with friends even though he doesn’t feel like it. Okay, perhaps the quality of these things declined, I know most of the time he doesn’t do anything at his internship, but at least he is there! I see how incredibly strong he is, getting out of bed and pulling himself through the day, but when I tell him this he responds with something like how he could manage these things effortlessly and is now barely able to take care of himself. I can only imagine how frustrating this must be for him.

Seeing him being so miserable is awful, but I can deal with his negativity quite well when it is not directed towards me. What hurts me the most is that he pushes me away, sometimes literally, he became so distant to me physically and emotionally. We don’t live together, and we see each other maybe one day a week, sometimes not even one day \(it used to be two, three, or four days a week\). When we do see each other he tolerates me being around him, he tolerates me giving him a kiss, he gives me a short ‘hug’ when I ask him, it is not a hug though, he puts his arms around me but there is no connection, it is an empty hug, he doesn’t feel anything. I can deal with not having sex \(it has been months\), but I need intimacy, I crave it at this moment. I know that when I ask for intimacy it will only make it less likely for him to give me a kiss/hug, but if I don’t ask for it, I don’t get it either. I’m always balancing between acting on my need for intimacy and respecting his need for distance. I don’t want to pressure him into anything, but I know that me being around him already feels like pressure to him. Another thing is that when I feel down, he cannot be there for me at all, he kind of panics and gets a mental breakdown himself. So I try not to express it too much when I feel down, but at the same time I think I should be able to communicate how I feel, and to be honest lately it gets harder and harder not to show how I feel and to stay positive. He is hurting me and rejecting me over and over again, the decisions he makes and the priorities he sets are so self\-centred, but I know he doesn’t do it intentionally, it is his depression doing it for him. Often when I feel down, it is because of our situation, he knows that and feels so guilty and that it is breaking him apart even more.

When I ask him things related to our relationship, his go\-to answer is ‘I don’t know’, I think it would be so helpful to him/us if he knew what he feels/wants/needs, but it is okay, people are allowed not to know, so I leave it at that. However, about one thing he is very clear, he needs space, from me and from everyone else, but especially from me. I try to give him that space, we see each other way less often, we also don’t call and text as much as we did, and when we are together I also try to give him space by not being physically close \(the latter is a bit hard for me though\). I’ve been compromising myself and adjusting my expectations, although this takes a lot from me, I think I have been doing it quite successful so far. But now it has come to the point that he wants our relationship to end, he wants to stop hurting me and breaking up seems the only way for him to do that. Also, he thinks that being in a relationship keeps him from getting better, because he needs even more space. And because he got better after his previous relationship ended, he now thinks that might happen again when we end our relationship. In a way I can see his point, and I don’t want to get in the way of him getting better, I want to give him all the space he needs, even if that means breaking up. But I cannot help but think that he is sabotaging himself with this thought of only getting better when we break up. I think it becomes kind of a self\-fulfilling prophecy and I cannot change the way he thinks about it.

I know he loves me, on very few occasions in the past months he told me I am the best girlfriend he could wish for, that \(despite pushing me away\) he likes it when I am around, that I am a great support to him, and that he is thankful for my patience, positivity, and the energy I put into our relationship. I know it is him telling me these things and it is his depression pushing me away/breaking up with me. But I don’t want to break up, and I know he wouldn’t either if he wasn’t depressed. I love him so so soooo much!! I want to be with him regardless of his mental state. I know it would probably also be best for me to break up, because my mental health is also starting to suffer from his. But I don’t want his depression to win this fight, I want us to win, but I guess I can no longer fight for the both of us… He tells me he needs to fight for himself to get his life back on track, I just wish I was part of being in that life… Knowing I’m losing him is So. Fucking. Painful…

For those still reading, thank you for taking the time! I mainly wrote this to hear from others if they recognize this pattern/have been or are in a similar situation, can be from either side \(his or mine\). Please tell me how you dealt with it. And perhaps share your thoughts on what you think about breaking up. Even though I at least partially know the answer \(see above\), maybe you can give me more insights in how it is possible to push away the person out of your life that you love so deeply.

First things first,
Im on mobile, so sorry for the format.
English is not my first language, but do correct me if I made any spelling mistakes.

This is the full story of my last reddit post on this sub:
https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8cp9qd/she_she_asked_me_on_a_date/?st=JGK7PODN&amp;sh=d87d9c7f


So, lets begin.

**A little backstory**
I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for almost 7 years now, its going better now but still struggling. Whole my life I’ve been overweight and to top things off 4 years ago I started balding (i’m 19 years atm, you do the math.)

Ive never really been in a relationship, or ever been with a girl. Sure, I had some flirting going on but not on a big scale. January 1st 2014, I was 14 at the time and I wanted to change. I wanted to loose weight, be cool, be the guy every girl wants. I was sick of being myself. 
So i joint a gym, worked out, got a job and made some money. I really changed and was... happy.

Now if you’re familiar with depression, it sometimes comes in waves. So I was happy, but for a time. Because a year later I started to feel down again, I made myself paranoid, suicidal thoughts and all that fun stuff. All the weight I lost came back, twice as hard. 

Skipping forward 1 miserable year, I went to a new school, a school which I don’t know anyone. A place full of strangers. So little anxiety me wasn’t happy. 


**So now you know a little bit about me, so here is were the seduction part begin. (please keep in mind my backstory)**
First day of this new school, I had a class of 20 guys and 2 girls... Yeah...
So the first class started and we were 20 minutes in and the door opens. And believe brothers, the most beautiful girl I have ever seen walks in. Every jaw in the class drops, even from the other 2 girls. We are talking about a HB 9.5 here. 

So you know what I did?
My insecure self said to myself: *I wont make a change with this girl so I wont even try it*. 
So thats what I did, I didn’t talk to her for the rest of the year... We had 1 or 2 conversations, but short ones. We were in a group project once but not many words were exchanged.
That was pretty much all the connections we had for the year.

So the first year of school was done, the first 6 months of the second year we needed to take an internship. And that might be the best thing that ever happened to me, my internship. I don’t know what it was, but I found something there. I found myself, I had motivation to change myself again, to become social, to become that guy again i once was. Weird right? I know.

So i started my journey on self improvement again, lost some weight, came outside my comfort zone. Did things I haven’t  done before, I even gave girls a shot. Approaching them more, talked to them more, some flirting and even some dating.

Internship finished and I was excited for school.
So back on school, seeing al my friends again. I was full of confidence and was once again... happy!
And then she came in, HB 9.5. 
And... and I said Hi to her, can you believe it? ME, I said hi to HER. AND SHE EVEN SAID HI BACK! It doesn’t sound like much. but for me at the time was HUGE! I even started a conversation with her, you know, the standard stuff, “How are you!” “I’m also fine, thanks.”  That kind of stuff.

So after a week of school we had a new project, a big one. This project would go for the entire year! The class would split up in 2 groups. 2 groups with 2 leaders. Wanna guess who the leaders are? Exactly! HB 9.5 and me, we are the leaders for this project. After we heard this I went to HB 9.5  and said in a funny way that it wasn’t a competition but she was gonna loose. This was the first time I made here laugh.

So quickly we were “forced” to spend time with each other for this project. Im still on my journey of self improvement and at the time I was full of confidence. So when we worked on the project, I wasn’t nervous, I just acted like the guy I want to be. And to my surprise, I didn’t scared her away. She exually thinks I’m a pretty cool dude. (Her words). So she upped our status, she became touchy. Touching my knee and let her hand rest there for a moment. Touching my shoulders, talking more about private stuff, she even text me... first. But when she does that and I reply to here she ignores me...

So yeah, here I am. A guy who have 0 experience with girls, playing the game with a HB 9.5.
The thing you need to know is, she has a boyfriend. She talked about going to Japan, I asked if she was going with here boyfriend and she said: “Only if were are still together.” 
I know there is allot of controversial stuff about girls with boyfriends on this sub. But still.

**This is the crazy part**
I have 3 girls in my class, The HB 9.5 and the other two aren’t HB’s Lets call them Girl 1 and Girl 2. 
Girl 1 bought a house were she lives alone, she invited Girl 2 and HB 9.5 over to drink at her house.

So here I am replying to a  mail from school thats about the project. HB 9.5 saw the mail and texted me to thank me for replying, because she was to drunk to reply. I replied to here asking if she was having fun because she told me were she was going that evening. She then send me some pictures of herself drinking and indeed having fun. Then HB 9.5 asked me to come to Girl 1 house. First i said no but she insisted i should come and that Girl 1 was okay with it. So without thinking twice I took my dads car and drove to Girl 1 house. 
I arrived to 2 drunk girls and a sober Girl 2, because Girl 2 doesn’t drink. I didn’t really care about Girl 1 and Girl 2 and went straight to HB 9.5 and sat next to her. We drank some shots and had allot of fun, we touched allot and even hold hands. Because I was with the car i couldn’t drive back home so I slept In Girls 1 house together with Girl 2 and HB 9.5, Girl 2 slept in Girl 1 bed and Girl 1, HB 9.5 and me slept on the couch. I slept almost next to HB 9.5 and Girl 1 was laying at the end of my feet. Sorry to say but we were way to drunk to do anything, we were all asleep after 5 mins of saying nothing.

The next morning I woke up and i couldn’t believe what happened. I woke up next to HB 9.5! THATS CRAZY! She woke up as well and we smiled to each other. She layt here legs on top of mine and created a little tension between us two. Soon everyone was awake and we made breakfast. HB 9.5 needed to work that day. She lives kinda far away, about 3 hours with the bus. Because i was with the car and it was only 1,5 hour ride to her place, i offered here a ride. She refused the first 2 times but accepted my offer the third time. And hold my hand thanking me.

On the ride to her work we did allot of talking and goofing around with music, we like allot of the same music. we flirted a little but not to much because we where both kinda tired. We arrived at her work and she invited me in. (Its a beach bar). I declined her offer because I really needed to go, so we gave each other a big hug and said goodbye.


**Back in school** 
So the next week in school HB 9.5 didn’t really talked to me much, I didn’t want to look desperate so i just played it cool and did my thing. HB 9.5 started to talk to other guys but I still played it cool and let her do her thing. After 3 days of radio silence, she texted me while siting in class. She asked me out (This was the other reddit post) I looked at here and I smiled. We set up a date and went the next day. The date went great and was fun, but again, it didn’t go further then a little touch and flirt. (Keep in mind that she has a boyfriend.) 
After this date I have allot of mixed signals from HB 9.5, one day she ignores me and the other day she is all over me. We have allot of alone time with this project and in this time we goof around and just having fun with once again, a little flirt and touch.

We text regular now but she still does this thing were she starts the text but ignores me. We hug when saying goodbye and during the break we go out together to eat somewhere or to drink coffee, we do this sometimes after school aswel.

But I was kinda getting sick of the mixed signals. So before the holiday starts, I wanted to ask her out. If she said no because of a bullshit reason then I will move on and keep her as just a friend. And if she said yes, then, then I don’t what to do anymore.

So last day before a holiday of 2 weeks I walked up to her and she said she was going to smoke outside, what was perfect for me so we had some alone time. But Girl 1 overheard us and wanted to come with... Great. So we went outside and I kinda kept my distance form HB 9.5 and Girl 1. And as planned HB 9.5 walked up to me and rest her head on my shoulders, I thought that was the perfect time to asked her out but i chocked. And there was Girl 1, saying shit which i didn’t listen to because I was nervous as fuck to ask HB 9.5 out. Smoke time was done and we went back to class, and still didn’t asked her. The day was slowly ending and I was making myself crazy. Our last lesson was a test. And offcoursse, HB 9.5 was done before me. She handed in her test and left... Great, there goes my last change.
But 5 min later she walks back in with another test, this was a test we did last week and on that day she was sick. I thanked god for this. I handed in my test and said to my friends they could go without me because I needed to do “things”. After 20 mins HB 9.5 walked out and asked what I was doing, I replied by saying i waited on her and asked which direction she needed to go, she said it was very sweet of me for waiting and that her bus was leaving in a hour, i suggested to go for a coffee and she said that was a good idea.
So sitting at the coffee bar I searched for al my confidents to ask her out, and so I did. And... she said yes. She said yes.


So, yeah. This is it. Not all of it but the most of it. I asked her out yesterday and she said yes. Crazy right?
Thanks for reading this messy story, I apologies for the story. I like writing I’m just not very good at it.

If you have any advice for me please let me know, also questions.
Be aware of my insecurities and that I’m blown away that this girl is so into me. I still cant believe all the time we have spend together. And all the stories we have told and al the physical connection we had. 
I try to play the game the best I can.  
But its hard, I think its hard.
But its going good, Im only slowly going crazy about this girl.   
Thanks again for reading!"

I'm doing an internship where I'm to dimension a plate heat exchanger (water-water). For calculating the needed area I use a overall heat transfer coefficient. My question is what are typical values for a plate heat exchanger. In Perry's is found values form 5700-7400 W/(m2*K). In VID Heat Atlas I found values ranging form 1000-4000 W/(m2*K). I found another source stating it from 3000-6000 W/(m2*K). 

In my company there already exists a plate heat exchanger (Alfa Laval). In the data sheet there is a test run specified. If I calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient from this test run I find a value of 6514 W/(m2*K).

In my calculations I chose a value of (7400-5700)/2=6650 W/(m2*K). By iteration my final value of the overall heat transfer coefficient comes down to 2624 W/(m2*K). This seems a bit on the low side to me. If I fool around a little bit with the initial overall heat transfer coefficient, the final answer I get after iteration remains 2624 W/(m2*K). My question is: what is an average value for a PHE?"

Hello Guys, 
I recently read the manga and asked myself, where the 3rd season of the anime is ending. The first half will probably end with One for All defeated and All might powerless. Thats what i could deduct from the OP of the first half and how they handled the Arcs before back in season 2. So, I naturally asked myself how they would end the secound half. I thought of ending it with the reveal of toga because the provisional license arc would be a great way to end the season and it would mimic the end of season 2, with the students fighting the teachers. But maybe the Arc is to short to fill a whole second half of a Season and we could see the Internship Arc happening. Whats your Opinion how it should be handled?

8ghbtl,0,2018-05-02,"Me [22F] with my dad [49M], he's cutting me off financially and it brings up a lot of problems I would like to address with him (scapegoat dynamic, unfairness), but I don't know which or how",unsuretysurelysucks,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ghbtl/me_22f_with_my_dad_49m_hes_cutting_me_off/,"Hello r/relationships, 

You guys have really helped me before and now I'm in a bit of a pickle and hope some kind strangers will take the time to help a girl out! 

First, some relevant background. My dad was never really around when I was a kid. He was always studying or working and the few times he did stick around for fun and games after dinner it was short lived. My mom talks about how he was very stressed from work and demanded the house to be clean and dinner on the table when he came home, and if not he would get upset. He denies this but I remember him getting upset with my mom for things that I thought at the time weren't such a big deal. 

He is also very manipulative and can talk his way out of anything. My sisters and I are alternately upset at one parent or the other and it's usually my mom. He can also flip emotionally really quickly, being totally happy until something goes wrong and then he's miserable to be around. I feel like he has changed positively the past few years and is more open to being reasonable, which brings me to the problem I'm here for. 

My mom recently mentioned wanting to cut me off financially. I get $500 from her and $400 from my dad. I stressed a lot about this because although it's a lot, I barely get by each month. I also borrow money on top of this (without interest) and will end up with ~$50,000 in debt after graduating. My sister studies in a more expensive country (at least concerning tuition) and will end up with ~$100,000 in debt. My mom said recently she will continue to pay me and not my sister since she does not have any financial issues. full disclosure, I'm a bit worse with money but am tracking my expenses with an app to see where I can cut down. My dad has not been paying my sister anything. I believe my sister and I have the same amount of monthly spending money, however I have a few more monthly expenses than she does. 

My dad skyped me yesterday and said he is going to cut me off financially. This was completely out of the blue and not discussed beforehand. I understand he has higher expenses since my 2 other sisters went to live with him and he has been supporting me on top of it. I know from my last post about financial disagreements in the family that I am not entitled to this money. However, if it was just not supporting me I would be more okay with it than what he said he is going to do. He will take the money and put it in a savings account to help pay off my sister's debt when she graduates. However, in my eyes 400 a month for me makes a bigger difference than $4,800 for max 2-3 years for my sister's debt. Both of us are in high demand sectors and will more than likely find good jobs relatively quickly after graduating. Furthermore these are government student loans which won't be collected quickly. 

This brings me to the reason I'm posting about this particular problem on this sub. Through reading stories here I've come to realise that as children I was the scapegoat and my sister (the one in question) is the golden child. This is what leads me to believe this is thinly veiled favouritism, or at least feels like it. Furthermore I can understand why he thinks it's fair from his point of view, however the people I have told about it (the same way as here, hope it's not too biased) agree that it's unfair.

I know for a fact my sister lies to him about taking city trips or buying certain things, so I bet he has a worse impression of my finances. I also would not rat out my sister of course. We have also talked about his unfair treatment of me and she agrees, so it's not like I'm pulling this out of my a$$. They recently had a misunderstanding and afterwards he was very open with her about improving communication (I've seen the message), whereas the last 2 times (including this one) that we've had an unexpected problem he goes off on me and makes me cry and feel like sh!t. He's the only one that triggers me this way and he'll just sit there and get upset that I'm upset and not even try to help. 

I'm going to get a job (which he always forbade me from doing in order to focus on my studies) and try and find ways of making my own money. However, this fall I start with a full-time internship which does not allow for the possibility of getting a job. I suppose in the weekend, but from everyone I've heard your social life already dies and I think it would cause me to burn-out since I'm pretty close already. The whole time my mom was undecided on whether to continue supporting me or not I was so stressed and even had suicidal thoughts come back. Now it's back because of my dad. 

So, I'm here to ask how to approach my dad to talk about these issues, especially if he is a narcissist. It's also brought up a lot of things he has caused, such as low self esteem and classic daddy issues. I don't know how much to tell him or what to focus on, although I have been writing down all my thoughts (since I can't focus on anything else lol). 

Tl;dr: my dad is taking the money he currently gives to me put aside to pay my sister's student loans. This brings up a lot of his narcissistic traits and a scapegoat/golden child dynamic with said sister, as well as problems I have in general with him. How can I bring these up to him effectively?"
8ghk3a,26,2018-05-02,Season 2 character flaws &amp; pacing issues,soswinglifeaway,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/8ghk3a/season_2_character_flaws_pacing_issues/,"So I've been rewatching from the beginning and season 2 is much more of a mess than I remember it. I watched the first few seasons on Netflix so it's not because I'm binging vs watching weekly. Some of the characters are driving me crazy and the pacing feels off also

1) Dr. Burke is a pompous jerk. I don't like him at all or the way he treats Cristina. Their fight near the end of season 2 where he was super crazy upset with her because she fell asleep before he had finished? I would have left him right then and there. How much of a PIG do you have to be to actually be mad at your girlfriend for this?? It's one thing to bring it up, or if its happening all of the time. But she was tired and didn't realize and went to sleep. She explained this to him and he was *still* standing his ground that this was a reasonable thing to be upset over. 

2) Izzie crying to Denny begging him to let her cut his LVAD wire was just awful. The acting was terrible first of all but the situation was also just absurd.

3) I don't remember disliking Callie so much when she was first introduced but I really can't stand her right now. Her getting upset with George because she didn't wash her hands, and trying to defend it by saying she didn't know they were home and she was embarrassed? That would have been one thing if she had seen them and then high tailed it back to her room for some clothes. Plus, who just walks around naked in someone else's house who has roommates and just *assumes* no one will be home? Also, her reaction to Meredith asking about Doc's cancer was insanely rude and self-righteous. Like, people care about their pets. It's not unreasonable to ask someone who might know something about it what their opinion is, even if that person is a doctor who treats *actual human beings*. And then she gets mad at George when he tries to point out that it was, in fact, reasonable for Meredith to ask about that because she cares about the dog.

4) Pacing. I know the timeline in this show has always been a mess, especially after the time jump in later seasons. But we're supposed to believe that Burke &amp; Cristina became serious enough to move in together in a matter of months? Especially because their relationship started out as just casual sex. Izzie fell in love with Denny in a matter of days or weeks? I'm pretty sure their internship is supposed to be a year long. Yet Bailey got pregnant and had a baby so their internship should almost be over right (they never mentioned Tuck being a premie I don't think)? Don't they stay interns until season 4? 

5) Edit to add: since I was so negative in my above points I did want to add one positive from the early seasons. I absolutely LOVE early Grey's Miranda Bailey. She's still a good character but her early seasons were gold.

People talk about the first few seasons and MAGIC like it was the glory days of Grey's but honestly after rewatching the first few seasons I can honestly say the show is better now than it was then. At least in terms of acting and production quality.

Anyway... not sure what the point of this post was. I guess to see if anyone agreed or if had any thoughts on the above. How do you feel about season 2 or the early days of Grey's in general? I think it gets better after Mark &amp; Lexie join the cast."
8ghm0z,2,2018-05-02,IT/CS students: Have you ever gotten an OJT related to your courses? (Also feeling conflicted),LoveArrowShooto,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/8ghm0z/itcs_students_have_you_ever_gotten_an_ojt_related/,"[Yesterday, I asked a question here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/8g5ik4/is_mis_management_information_system_suppose_to/) if MIS is mostly IT tech support and some of you pointed out that it is mostly software. Today, I spoke to HR and the MIS department head and they told me that there is no opening in their software division. The HR gave me a decision to make, whether I should continue or find another company. I asked if i can leave for the day and head home for me to think about it. Tomorrow (as of writing this) I will meet with my OJT advisor at school to submit couple of paperworks and from there, I will explain what i did at the company. And it's not going to end well for sure since they made it clear during the OJT orientation that *CS must only take software related jobs.* Otherwise, your hours will not be credited.

After talking to my mom about the situation, which later she told everyone in this family and now everyone is hounding me to make a decision. They are all telling me to continue, despite what the school advisor says. All they keep telling me is that you won't always get the job you want as an intern or a job related to your course and then pointing out the obvious facts that interns can't touch production systems. Then they compare their OJT to mine where they just deliver paper to different departments, coffee boy, etc;. They just don't seem to understand (non IT/CS graduates). 

I understand both point of view. If I continue my ""non-credited"" internship, I'll gain the work experience, but won't be graded, however I still fail and have to do another OJT. While it is a nice job to have, it is not within my scope. And IT is something I can easily pick up since I've worked with computers pretty much my entire life. Programming is something I recently picked up and I'm enjoying it, but I need more exposure on it.

On the other hand, I can stop the internship and go back and continue working for the rest of the Summer finishing up my Thesis. Once I finish my final semester this coming June, I can go out and find another company to do internship in. This time around, finding a proper software company to do internship in.

I want to decline and just focus on my Thesis. I spent the month of April applying at the company. At this point, it's too late to find another company since Summer ends within a month. The one thing I'm worried about is them pulling me down when I decline. Saying things like ""Sayang naman"" ""Bakit hindi mo tinuloy?"" etc etc;. 

Personally, I want an internship that will allow me to grow my foundation as a programmer. Yet, nobody seems to understand. Basically feeling conflicted right now :/

Anyway, for the fellow IT/CS students of /r/Philippines, have you ever gotten an OJT related to your courses? I know for you IT guys, you have it easier, but I'd also like to hear the CS side of things especially. "

However, I’m just not sure about the job availability. Should i just go all in and get a bachelors in digital forensics and cybersecurity or get a bachelors in business information technology and then get the certifications for digital forensics afterward? If i get the degree in digital forensics I feel like it would be easier for me to get a job in that field but it would be harder to get in any other IT field."

I need advice on how to land an interview to get a chance to work for any of the firms. Let’s just say my college experience was a life lesson in which I hit rock bottom but came back on top to finish my degree due to life circumstances but I did it! But by doing so I never got a chance to intern anywhere, hence why I’m at a small firm. But that has not stopped me, I’m still working my way up even through obstacles to get my CPA license. I’m very driven and passionate about my goals. 

Can anyone offer me advice on what I should do? I have looked at their job openings but I’m not sure if I fit the experience they are looking for in any associate position. I’m trainable and able to do it!  I just need that one firm/hiring manager to give me the chance!

My college roommate Michelle told me a while back about her high school band teacher who was kinda a mentor figure to her, and she had a crush on through all 4 years of high school. I didn't think too much of it at the time, lots of people have a teacher that they secretly crush on. 

Then on her birthday, the teacher Mr. H. sent her a card that was hand drawn, which seemed like a lot for a student, even a favorite student. 

Michelle told me about halfway through the year that she had met up with her band teacher to ""catch up"" and that had turned into more coffee dates, romantic walks at night, and kissing. And that they hadn't had sex yet, but she thought she might be ready soon.

That really weirded me out. My mom's a teacher so I know about the strict rules they have about professional conduct with students. And this guy who she looked up to since 14, making out with her when she was just six months out of high school? He sounded sketchy to me.

Apparently he even said some ""romantic"" stuff to her when she was his student. 

I tried to suggest the age difference and the fact that he knew her as a kid might point to them being in different stages in life, which is just fine for a mentor/student relationship, but not as good for a romantic relationship. But she didn't want to listen, saying that they had a lot in common and that it hadn't been an issue this far. Apparently her mom even knew about everything, and didn't see a problem with it.

I tried to sneakily play matchmaker for her with a few cute college boys, bringing them and a friend over to hang out with the two of us, but she wasn't into them.

I've been stuck between knowing I should stay out of her business, and worrying about her. She's so smart otherwise, an overachiever academically, pretty, and confident socially, so she could have her pick of guys.

We're going to keep living together over the summer, and next school year. (She has an internship and I have summer classes and a job) We get along as roommates, and talk sometimes, but we mainly hang out with different groups. 

I don't want to make our roommate relationship awkward, but I'm so weirded out by the situation.

Tldr - My roommate is dating a teacher she had in high school. Should I mind my own business, even though it's sketchy as hell?

Recently, he considered filing a civil-rights complaint against Stanford over women-only hours at their gym, two hours for two days a week - but, after some complaint from a male student at Stanford, ""the recreation department decided to open up the same space for an equal number of hours focusing on weight lifting for men. In addition, all community members may drop in any time the studio is open (regardless of gender focus). No one is being banned because of gender.""

He shared an email with The College Fix, in which he asked Associate Vice Provost for Academic and Faculty Affairs Pamela Heatlie to review the programs “for compliance with Title IX laws, Proposal 2 of the Michigan Constitution, and UM’s own statement of non-discrimination.” (Heatlie is also senior director of the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX coordinator.)

It includes the Och Initiative for Women in Finance in the business school, whose goal is “to increase awareness of and access to careers for women in finance,” and the Credit Suisse 2018 Women’s Mentor Program, a two-day program that tells “outstanding female sophomores” about summer internship programs at the financial services company. The other programs involve medicine: one for faculty and administrators to “accelerate the development of women for senior positions in academic medicine and healthcare”; a women-only “cardiac treatment program,” which UMich calls “one of only a few in the country ... specifically for women; the Women’s Respiratory Clinic, which is limited to “female patients” and says women’s “respiratory health deserves extra attention for multiple reasons”; and the Department of Psychiatry’s Women and Infants Mental Health program, which focuses on “the wellbeing and special mental health needs of women.”

He told told Heatlie that these programs appear to exclude and discriminate against “male students, patients, and faculty” in violation of state and federal law and UMich policy.

It's not much, but hey. It's a start. Anyhow...

The California Institute of Integral Studies, a private university in San Francisco known as a place that ""trains healers and social justice warriors"", according to The College Fix writer, recently held a workshop designed to “make whiteness more conscious, visible, and tangible” to its participants, an event meant to “deepen and enliven anti-racist praxis.” The university, which offers a doctor of philosophy in transformative studies, hosted its “Making Whiteness Conscious” workshop at Namaste Hall on the school’s Mission Campus.

The two-hour seminar was led by Zara Zimbardo, an instructor at the institute’s School of Consciousness and Transformation and its Masters of Fine Arts Programs. “The system of racial privilege is often unconscious for white people,” the event listing reads. “This workshop engages multiple processes that make whiteness more conscious, visible, tangible and a site of critical inquiry for knowledge and change. In this time when the rise of white supremacy is hypervisible, what is critical to turn towards that may reside in the shadows of collective understanding?”

One of the workshop's goals states was to engage in “tools of somatic awareness.” Participants took part in “theatre of the oppressed” exercises, as well as “individual and group reflection, discussion, and brief didactic introduction of frameworks."" At the end of the workshop, they were expected to have a better understanding of “white racial identity,” and how to “cultivate racial justice orientation.""

The College Fix reached Zimbardo by phone, who told them that she would be willing to discuss the workshop if she would be permitted to view the final draft of the article before this reporter submitted it to his editors. When told that this was not possible, Zimbardo subsequently ceased communication with The Fix. Her profile on the institute’s website states that her work “is influenced by frameworks of critical pedagogy, postcolonial studies, feminist praxis and popular education that seek to make forms of shared knowledge and experience more conscious.”

Last semesters, it hosted an event titled “Whiteness, Spirituality, and Social Change,” which was meant to instruct “white people into a deeper understanding of their personal relationship to race, white privilege, and systemic racism.” This semester the school also offered a “highly interactive 8-week class for white-identified people” that examined “what it means to be white” with the goal of “unpack[ing] the stories that inform whiteness and explore how we embody them in our lives.”

“We believe that white people coming together to build trust, share stories, and be real in regards to our whiteness is an essential first step in the long journey to collective healing and liberation,” it read.

My predicted grades are likely to be lower than the minimum requirements for the courses I wish to apply for \(Mechanical/Civil engineering at Bristol, Bath, Southampton or UCL\) due to being ill for 9 months last year and admittedly I have been quite lazy this year. However I've recently got my act together and at this rate am extremely likely to achieve the grades I need at A level next year. Rather than settling for a course at a university I am not too excited about, I am considering taking a gap year and reapplying for uni during the gap year. During the gap year I plan to do an engineering internship, and if that is not possible then get a job or volunteering. Also general self improvement as my life has fallen behind in other areas as well. anyway I have a couple of questions and your general thoughts will be appreciated.

tl;dr: Want to do mechanical/civil engineering at Bristol,Bath, Southhampton or UCL. I would appreciate your opinions.

1. Will universities such as Bristol and UCL look unfavourably at applicants who have taken a gap year, especially for a competitive course such as Engineering?

2. Are there any financial incentives I will miss out on by taking a gap year e.g. government subsidies?"

8gk6gp,128,2018-05-02,Obfuscationization,form_d_k,shittyprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyprogramming/comments/8gk6gp/obfuscationization/,"Pretend you're tasked with designing code that works with sensitive information, such as for IAM (Individual Account Mastering). You might create a function named `AuthenticateUserUsingDefaultKey8801AFGK7223KXWY()`. Obviously you wouldn't want that publicly revealed. You would think compilering your code into an execucutable or DLL ('dell') would hide that private information. But did you know that your code can be DEcompilered?

&amp;nbsp;

Decompilering is a technique hackers developed to steal code, typically selling it on the dark web for BitCoinage and/or bath salts. All languages are susceptible to decompilering, including staples such as Lua, Delphi, &amp; Inform 7. But that doesn't mean your code MUST be vulnerable. The solution? **OBFUSCATIONIZE**.

&amp;nbsp;

#Obfuscationization Strategies

There are several tactics you should take to make your code less readable. One is to shorten names as much as possible. Take the aformented function name, `AuthenticateUserUsingDefaultKey8801AFGK7223KXWY()`. Abbrevimenting would give us `AuthUsrUsingDefKey8801AFGK7223KXWY()`. Many hackers are from foreign places (mostly Luxemborgian) and a simple change like this would make it much harder for them to easily understand without much difficulty what this function is or isn't doing unless expending great effort to do so and not expediently even if they were to.

&amp;nbsp;

But we can go further. A technique we like to use is removing all non-critical vowels. In this case, the function would now be `thsrsngDfKy8801AFGK7223KXWY()`. This makes it even *more* difficult for hackers who aren't native American speakers to understand.

&amp;nbsp;

One additional step is to add unneccesaried parameters: `thrsngDfKy8801AFGK7223KXWY(string noImportante = Constants.7, byte nedulezite = Constants.W)`. For more trickery, add a parameter that defaults to `true` and results in an unhandled exception unless set to `untrue`: `thrsngDfKy8801AFGK7223KXWY(bool achtungGefahr = true, string noImportante = Constants.7, byte nedulezite = Constants.W)`.

&amp;nbsp;

***
^**note:** *We actually plan to release a tool soon that will automatically make these changes on pushin. We will offer it for all major languages, unless source in that language is unreadable by default (see: JavaScript).*
***

&amp;nbsp;

#But Is It Enough?

Short answer: NO. You can never underestimate hackers, particularly those from Luxemborg. It is always a battle of wits but YOU CAN. COME OUT. ON TOP!

&amp;nbsp;

One very useful manner for obfuscationizing involves simply naming the function in a misleading manner. For example, at our shop we were developing a data entry platform in Unity and obfuscanitized a function name as `pdtFrm(bool no = Boolean.Yes)`. Unless you had tribal knowledge, you would assume the function actually, well... UPDURTS A FRAME. Instead, the function actually is a post-post frame updurt handler handler!!

&amp;nbsp;

Another solution is to strip comments from source; not only does this make it harder to understand the internals of your code, it also saves storage space. If you are required to have comments, make sure they also contribute to unreadability.

&amp;nbsp;

#Conclusion

Obfuscationization is an important tool for your programmer toolbox. If an intern ~~or independent code auditor~~ is able to read your code, SO CAN THE HACKERS. You are ultimately responsible for maintainating code security, providing tribal knowledge, and continuing job security. **OBFUSCATIONATE.**

We are writing with important updates reflecting the current situation.

##Course Completion Options

Many of you have already opted for the variety of course completion options available to you. This includes the Assessed Grade option as well as expanded options to apply Pass/Fail grading to courses.

Once the strike ends, there will be further options available to those who want or need to complete the remainder of their course material. We intend to provide a variety of flexible options for completing the term, including completing the remaining in-class weeks of courses. However, we know that many of you will be unable to attend rescheduled classes due to commitments including jobs, returning home, participating in exchanges or internships, and so on. You should feel free to embark on these activities. Following the end of the strike, a variety of learning options and changes to the kind, weight, and types of assignments will be forthcoming to enable those who wish to complete outstanding course work to do so.

##Applying to Graduate &amp; Convocation

Students applying to graduate this spring are also asking about their eligibility and convocation. If you applied to graduate by the deadline, your record has been pre-audited to confirm completion or identify any outstanding degree requirements. Final grades will be added as they become available.

Between now and May 21, your Faculty Dean’s office will review your record to identify any outstanding requirements and consider additional measures that can facilitate completion so that you can graduate as expected.

While we are making every effort to assist students eligible to graduate and complete their degrees in time for the spring Convocation, students who complete requirements later in the summer will be invited to attend the fall Convocation ceremony held in October 2018. We anticipate holding spring Convocation during the weeks previously announced, between June 15, 2018 and June 23, 2018, with some potential minor adjustments to the ceremonies within that timeline.

We understand your frustration and stress with the strike and apologize for this disruption. It is certainly not the experience we hoped for you. We continue to try to resolve the situation and support you through this difficult time.

This year is both of our senior year of college, so we'll be graduating in a few weeks, him after completing a 5 year BS/MS program and me a 4 year BS. This entire semester my boyfriend's been extremely busy between his coursework, his thesis, his senior design project, and his on campus job that he needs to pay rent. He barely has time to eat, sleep, and shower, never mind spend much time with me. I'm lucky if I see him for an hour or so late at night once a week, even though he lives two minutes away.


We used to talk extensively every day. We've done long distance for 7 months while he did an internship abroad and we normally have very good communication. But lately I don't enjoy talking to him. I don't value hard work the way he does; I take pride in what I do but I don't go out of my way to push myself because I highly value enjoying life and taking time to relax. I hate seeing my boyfriend push himself like this. He's lost weight and has permanent dark circles under his eyes. He's often irritable and reeks of caffeine. When I ask him ""how was your day?"" it's always the same thing: ""I barely slept last night"" ""I have a million things due tomorrow"" ""None of my teammates are pulling their weight"" ""The project broke again and is way behind schedule"" ""I'm pulling another all nighter tonight and have eaten nothing but snacks from the vending machine next to the lab"". When I ask him if there's anything I can do to help he tells me no. I've stopped asking how he's doing because it just upsets me to hear it.


On the other side, I've stopped talking to him honestly about how I'm doing. He has a full time job lined up for after we graduate that he's excited about, and wants me to move with him to the city where it is. I've been looking for jobs since I finished my most recent internship last semester, but haven't found anything yet. I love this school, and I love my field of study, but I've had 3 internships in my field and enjoyed none of them. I'm dreading giving up the freedom and creative control I've enjoyed at school in favor the grind of a 9-5. I was unhappy in high school and feel like I really found my place in college; I'm anxious and depressed at the thought of leaving the place I feel most at home and never returning. I'm scared of the future, and I don't know what I'm going to do next.


These are normally things I'd tell him. I have a hard time opening up usually but my boyfriend has really helped me get better at communicating my feelings honestly. I can always count on him to make me feel heard, and he's gotten good at comforting me. But because he's so busy I don't want to burden him with worrying about me. I have no doubt that if I told him he would drop everything to come over and comfort me, but that would only make things harder on him and I don't feel like it's fair for me to ask that of him.


At the beginning of the semester it was really hard not seeing him and not having him to talk to, and I was lonely a lot. But I got used to it, spent more time with friends, and have come to enjoy a lot of the time I spend alone. Now I don't feel close to him anymore. When he does come over it feels like there's a stranger in my apartment. Our conversations feel shallow and distant; he has nothing to talk about besides work and doesn't interest me as a person like he used to. I've found myself getting irritated with him more easily, found it harder to talk to him, and we don't really have time to do activities together anymore. When I try to imagine what my life would be like without this relationship, it feels like it would be almost exactly the same.


With graduation right around the corner it feels like we're approaching a pivotal point in our relationship. Soon we'll have to talk about our plans for the next phase of life. I'm feeling very uncertain about my future, not just with him but in general. I don't know what I want anymore.

TL;DR My boyfriend is extremely busy with grad student life, and we don't see each other or talk very often as a result. I feel that a distance has grown between us, and I don't enjoy spending time with him as much anymore. Graduation is fast approaching and I'm anxious about the future."
8gmynl,13,2018-05-02,[No Spoilers] [Hardware &amp; Software issues] After 3 years I recovered a corrupted cloud save file,jay_bleu,dragonage,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/8gmynl/no_spoilers_hardware_software_issues_after_3/,"Let me start off with the fact that I absolutely love this series. Played all the games in chronological order and had a blast. I was 140 hours into my canon playthrough in Inquisition, when one day my PC crashed while syncing cloud saves and they got corrupted. Needless to say, I was pretty pissed. I tried restoring from local saves but I got some other error message, I can't honestly say what exactly it said for it was almost 3 years ago.

I looked for help on forums and I wrote to EA support asking if maybe they had my cloud saves backed up somewhere in their servers (maybe a bit extreme but we're talking 140 hours gameplay, I REALLY wanted to finish this game in 100%). Nothing could be done. Things got ugly and maybe I got a bit too mad at who probably was just an intern that was assigned to help me. ~~I think the fact that I was about to finish Trespasser as Lavellan romancing a certain egg and was denied the ending didn't help.~~

Fast forward a few years and three attempted DA:I playthroughs later, I got really into Dragon Age lore, even more than before. Listening to all the good stuff made me want to play myself once more - especially that blighted Trespasser. As a last desperate attempt at fixing my precious canon save I did something that should have not worked at all. But it did. I still can't believe it worked as I'm writing this.

^Note ^that ^back ^when ^I ^described ^my ^problem ^to ^EA ^Support ^they ^said ^they're ^very ^sorry ^but ^nothing ^could ^be ^done ^about ^it. ^Just ^a ^small ^reminder.

**Before you attempt any of this, be sure to make a backup of your files!**

So, when I looked at the save files I had from that unfortunate PC crashed all looked like [this](https://i.imgur.com/qCmhq5N.png), with the first few being the size 0 kilobytes which obviously meant there was no data = they were corrupted. I found a file with data on it and just for shits and giggles tried to swap it's name with a save I knew worked, meaning a save I created a while ago on my other playthrough.

[The first file is one of the cloud saves and the second is the working local save.](https://i.imgur.com/5kN4j5B.png) Note that they are different file extensions.

Essentially what I did was just swap the name of the cloud save with the working save's name [\[1\]](https://i.imgur.com/13nDii3.png), right-clicked on the .tmp file and went to Properties [\[2\]](https://i.imgur.com/1nFKhaP.png) and just changed the file extension to the same as the local save (which is .DAS) [\[3\]](https://i.imgur.com/mJLQ36s.png). After I clicked OK it gave me [this](https://i.imgur.com/e4Mf41Q.png) warning message but at this point I just wanted my Lavellan back, you know? I was ready to mess up the whole game, man.

[But lo and behold, it somehow worked.](https://i.imgur.com/gWBAsvl.jpg) 

How? I have no idea. It shouldn't have worked. I have been told nothing would bring my saves back but this did? What the fuck, why did it work. I was ready for the game to crash anytime but everything was fine (of course I didn't get all of my playthrough back because the newest files got corrupted but still, I got 118 hours of gameplay instead of none so I will call it a win). 

[Here's the first screenshot I took.
](https://i.imgur.com/aA8JpOp.jpg) If it was a picture taken with a camera instead it would be blurry because I was shaking with bitter laughter.

[Another, after going to Skyhold and changing the ugly pyjamas into something more presentable](https://i.imgur.com/5YRr9Lj.jpg) (I believe that save was from before the patch that introduced the Garderobe).

After that I copy-pasted all the backup I had from my current playthrough and found out relieved that everything works. [\[1\]](https://i.imgur.com/Mvi2pWM.jpg) [\[2\]](https://i.imgur.com/QHcchuP.jpg) [\[3\]](https://i.imgur.com/7SX4VRj.jpg)

I'm crying here, you guys. On one hand (ha!) I'm very disappointed in EA for not helping me earlier, but on the other I'm super happy that I got my canon Inquisitor back and I even get to play Trespasser with her.

Anyway, I really hope that somebody someday that had the same problem will find this post and my bizarre solution that will make it all great again.

**TLDR; I just wanted my save files to work so I did something stupid but in the end it worked so it wasn't stupid? No. It's still stupid and I have no idea how the fuck it works.**

EDIT: So I actually found some other files on my old PC and tried a few things and got all of my game back. The God is real."
8gn0ex,1,2018-05-02,Am I 21F being unreasonable towards 23M for not supporting me when I'm feeling down?,StraightSwimmer51,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8gn0ex/am_i_21f_being_unreasonable_towards_23m_for_not/,"Dear readers,

I’m in a new relationship with Josh for a month now.
Everything goes out great but we recently have a problem.

(I’m from France and he’s from New Zealand, where I’m currently at for internship)
We do alot together and we have lots of fun.

Because of my past and maybe the fact i furthermore dont really know anyone in here (scary) is it that sometimes I have those down moments where you normally just talk about with the one close to you, in this situation Josh.

When I say to him that I feel down he does asks whats wrong but wont really talk with me. When I get mad after a day or so of him not asking anything we have this huge fight where we call eachother immature and selfish.

My argument in this story : If I feel down and I tell you there should ring a bell (because you love me and  care about me) of you asking me how why and if you could do anything to make it better by talking or anything. In that way everything is done and It’s cool within like 30 mins. I should tell this often happens when I’m almost on my period or it just started. I’ve got super bad pains so I stay home I cant walk of the pain. He knows all of this.

His argument : I am immature because I reflect my problem of being sad on him and it is a sign that I am not capable to take care of myself. 
He doenst like the thought that he should react when I feel down.
I feel like he doenst care about me and shows this by ignoring/making jokes.
I get mad, he gets mad story.

I think there is a truth in his story, but are there any other redditors that have trouble with talking to their SO seriously?



tl;dr My boyfriend thinks when I’m sad its my problem and not his and that I shouldnt reflect my anger (of him not asking me about it ) on him.

Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

8gn34o,3,2018-05-02,[ROLEPLAY] Darkplace Goes Dark (Part 3),ANazaryan,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/8gn34o/roleplay_darkplace_goes_dark_part_3/,"###[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/8gn31o/roleplay_darkplace_goes_dark_part_2/)

**Castle Darkplace, uh, well, uh...y’know, Darkplace.**

The answer was Castle Darkplace. Perched on a hill overlooking the backroads between Darkplace and the old town, the scene of Moloch’s downfall had, in recent months, become the forward operating base of Earl Winston and his chief (by virtue of being sole) minion Aquarius Jackson, where they could plot their nefarious deeds. Winston had been allowed past the traps and magical defences of Cedric Darkplace, the early-modern courtier of Queen Elizabeth and, through happenstance, the founder of the town, by virtue of being his last living ancestor, once Gertrud Tremond had been dealt with (Tremond’s children were conceived by IVF, which the Lord Darkplace apparently didn’t count). Although you might have been expecting Earl to get up to all kinds of sinister schemes, he had actually remained remarkably quiet until recently, and was considered to be a good neighbour by many denizens of the forest. At the present moment in time, Winston was in the subterranean Scrooge McDuck-esque geldchamber of his most noble ancestor, relaxing with a Jack and Coke on his bed of centuries-old cash.

**WINSTON:** It’s the little things in life. 

Earl then raised his glass up into the air.

**WINSTON:** A toast, to Earl!

Clinking it off of nothing in particular, Winston downed his drink in ten seconds flat. Perhaps he was in a celebratory mood because of the enchantment he had recently put on the toasters of Angland, causing millions of people to have to contend with burned bread, but that’s just speculation on our part. Earl haphazardly tossed the empty bottle over his shoulder, resulting in it hitting a mound of gold coins and shattering into a mosaic of shards. 

**WINSTON:** Whoopsie-daisy! 

Having heard all the commotion from the geldchamber, Aquarius soon arrived in the gilded room to inquire as to what had happened.

**AQUARIUS:** Ayo icemang, everything one hunnid in hurr??

**WINSTON:** Well, Aquarius, you tell me, does that pile of shattered glass over there look “one hunnid” to you??! 

The obedient housewigger glanced over at shattered glass, which Earl was now pointing towards.

**AQUARIUS:** Uh.. no suh. You wan’ me to go and clean dat shiet up, massah?

**WINSTON:** No, I want you to stand there and look pretty.

**AQUARIUS:** Ayo boss-man, I can do dat. 

**WINSTON:** Yes, Aquarius, I want you to clean up the broken glass, for Christ’s sake! Now, get to it, and afterwards, you’ve got to pick some cotton to stuff my new pillow!

**AQUARIUS:** Suh yes suh! 

Aquarius, as they say, “got to it”, starting to pick up the pieces of the broken bottle much like Andy Smalls a few days earlier. In contrast to the retarded and soft Andy, Aquarius had extremely calloused hands, which formed something approaching a protective hide against the shattered glass. As he did this, Aquarius appeared to be whistling a merry tune under his breath which, upon closer listening, was “Dem Bones,” a popular spiritual song among people of his race, which is to say, white folks. Earl glanced over to make sure Jackson was doing a proper job, before his crystal ball, which was lying on a geldpile beside him, started to turn from a clear white to a cloudy blue. In palantir terms, this meant: You’ve got mail. 

**WINSTON:** I’ll just be a minute, Jackson.

Earl stood up on top of his geld, effortlessly gliding across it and showing Bilbo Baggins in the 18th Hobbit movie who was actually boss. Winston walked out through the wooden door separating the treasure room from the rest of the castle, heading out into a corridor made out of solid stone. It was not that the castle was unfurnished, or even remotely medieval, but quality of decour comes second to safety when your entire fortune’s at stake. Faced with a long, dark corridor ahead of him, Winston turned left and came to a circular staircase of one of the castle towers, which he ascended. As Winston moved on up the tower, he passed through several different architectural styles in the corridors jutting off from it, and walked by patches of stone that were clearly reconstructive efforts after battles long since faded from the collective memory. Like the good housechurl Minihawking in the castle of the anti-tribal avenger Duke, but in reverse, Earl continued to move up the imposing tower until he arrived at the top, which was entirely open to the elements save for the slender beams that held the conical roof up, giving the castle’s new owner a 360 degree view of the surrounding land. He was immediately assaulted by heavy, torrential rain as he stepped out into a mighty storm, though not nearly as mighty as the one conjured up by Shlomo in his battle with old Saint Nick. Winston stepped out from the roof towards a narrow ledge, letting the wind buffet his pure cool looking magician coat.  As he stared out into the unnaturally darkened, storm-drenched landscape, down onto the Forest of Dean and out towards the mountains, Earl saw a murder of crows (You could also call them ravens, as the two terms are functionally synonyms, with ravens just being pretty big crows) heading towards the castle. An important thing to note about crows is that many of them are irritable, and have silly names, so keep that in mind. As Earl became progressively more soaked than Shaker Aamer after a particularly elongated waterboarding at Guantanamo, the crows started to dive-bomb towards the castle. If they were inclined to shite on Winston, then at least it would quickly be washed off. As the crows zeroed in on Earl like zeroes against the USS Enterprise (Another Big E, to be sure), they suddenly all dissipated into a haze of black smoke, which filtered out into the air before rapidly coming back together on top of Castle Darkplace. Seconds after the crows had gone up in smoke, they reformed as a woman, raven-haired, sword-bearing, and with a really cool warrior-magician green-black outfit that - on the d/l - dabbed on Earl. 

**WINSTON:** Morrigan, to what...particular issue do I owe this, rare, *rare* pleasure? 

See, we told you that crows have stupid names. It should be, at this stage, noted that none of us are under any illusion that Earl isn’t talking to The Morrigan, a noted Celtic war-god. Laurent Le Foll literally battled Moloch earlier on, and we do have the mysterious case of the the big-suited mannish Vole. Also, Earl’s literally a wizard. At this stage, should we even have to explain that the banshee has landed on the roof of former international superspy turned malign villain Earl Winston’s castle? Well, anyway, the intensely powerful supernatural being (Not the first to appear, lemme tell ya!) circled Earl once or twice, before coming to a stop just off to his right-hand side.

**THE MORRIGAN:** Do you remember the terms of our agreement? 

**WINSTON:** Buy one get one free?

HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HOLY SHIT OWNED 

**THE MORRIGAN:** Cute, but inaccurate. 

**WINSTON:** And here I thought I had it dead to rights. 

**THE MORRIGAN:** Things have gone into motion, Earl. Already, the pieces on the chessboard move into position. The Tribe are doing...their thing, and in opposition to them this King of England, Morrissey, and his wizard, Eno. Eno has recruited an old friend of his to stand against the Tribe, everyone has already crossed the starting line...and the time’s at hand for someone to come in and flip the table and the entire chessboard with it. 

Winston contemplated matters, while the rain showed no sign of letting up in the slightest, displaying much weather-based dickery. 

**WINSTON:** I’ve got things planned, old sport. If you’re saying that it’s time to take the entire planet by storm, then all I can say is that I’ve already started, but...I guess this calls for a higher gear, doesn’t it? 

Earl turned around and looked down towards Darkplace town, which sat covered in a haze of rain off in the distance, St. John’s church the only building recognisable from this distance.

**WINSTON:** Step one, testing in progress.

**THE MORRIGAN:** And step two?

**WINSTON:** Step two follows step one, naturally. Step two is -

A rumble of thunder drowned out Earl’s voice, so let’s just assume that step two is binge-watching all 18 seasons of Game of Gnomes, the midget-based Game of Thrones parody sitcom.

**The Walker Residence**

Jennifer Walker was a good girl. She loved her mama, Jesus, and America too. She was also crazy about Elvis (Costello, hopefully). She loved horses, too, and you can’t forget that boyfriend of hers, Brad. Actually, only a couple of those things we just listed were true, and we can tell you definitively it wasn’t the bit about Jesus. In reality, Jennifer was just like any other teenage girl in a modern, western society. She kept plenty of secrets from her parents, like the fact that she had gone over on her phone bill last month (can you really blame her though when there’s so much juicy gossip to be discussed?) or that silly lil’ nicotine addiction she’d developed from that vape she definitely doesn’t keep under her bed. But we aren’t here to judge Jennifer (God knows she gets enough of that from her parents and classmates). No, we’re simply here to tell her story, which, at the moment, involved her lying in bed with the phone cord stretched to its absolute limit, preparing to place a call. Before she could, though, the door to her room opened, almost knocking down her...idk...Bieber poster? Ed Sheeran? We’re really out of touch, folks. Please help. It was her mother, Julia. 

**JENNIFER:** Mind my Weeknd poster, mom!

**JULIA:** I don’t know why you’ve got it covering the door. Back in my day, we had to keep our Michael Jackson posters at least thirty yards away from us.

**JENNIFER:** Yeah, well, that was like.. 60 years ago, mom!!!!!!@ Plus, didn’t Michael Jackson, like, totally rape a pile of boys? The Weeknd’s only crime is making soulful music! 

The Weeknd had actually been convicted on several counts of child molestation around a decade ago, but a powerful injunction with the High Court had prevented the information from filtering down to the average Briton. 

**JULIA:** Alright, well, are you sure you’ve got everything you need? 

Jennifer rolled her eyes.

**JENNIFER:** Yes, mom, for the tenth time, I’m sure.

**JULIA:** Your father and I are going to be gone all week, so you better be double sure.

**JENNIFER:** I’m triple sure. 

**JULIA:** Well, alright, I just don’t want you calling your father and I for anything while we’re out on the yacht he just bought with your college fund! 

**JENNIFER:** If I need anything, Brad can just bring it to me…

Jennifer said this last bit under her breath, accompanied by the typical pre-attitude eye-roll.

**JULIA:** What was that, sweetie?

**JENNIFER:** Ugh, I said I’ll be fine, mom! You know you and dad can leave now for your stupid boat, I’m F-I-N-E - fine!

**JULIA:** Alright sweetie. Take care!

Julia walked back out the door, and after a few minutes, Jennifer heard her parents leave and pull out of the driveway in their Audi. Eagerly and filled with much non-virginal teenage lust, Jenny went to dial her boyfriend’s number, but the phone rang before she could. Supposing that Brad was ringing her instead, she picked the phone up, only to be confronted with heavy breathing on the other end.

**JENNIFER:** Hello?...Hello? Hi? Brad, is that you?

**VOICE:** **Prepare to enter a whole new world of pain tonight, slut…**

**JENNIFER:** *Brad!* I could’ve totally had it on speaker with my parents in the room just now! God, you just don’t give two fr*icks about the consequences, do you, Brad??!!

**VOICE:** **YOU’RE GONNA GET SOME CONSEQUENCES, BITCH!**

The guy on the other end of the phone then hung up. He probably wasn’t Brad.

**JENNIFER:** Probably just Brad. Maybe I’ll fake a pregnancy test to get back at him!!!1

Speaking of Brad, he was actually lurking outside Jennifer’s window right at this minute, like some kind of night-time rapist. In spite of the fact that the town was currently being subject to torrential rain, Brad didn’t seem to have brought an umbrella, and was now wetter than Lord Heseltine, to make a reference that will go over the head of anyone born after about 1970. Brad, who would probably contract pneumonia thanks to his inherent dimness, knocked on the window, opening to gain his girlfriend’s attention.

**BRAD:** Jenny, I think I’m gonna die out here! Help! I’ve never been so scared in my life!

Much like a cat, Brad seemed to fear the rain. Jenny walked over and undid the latches on her window, allowing him to get shelter from the storm.

**BRAD:** Everything’s just water!

Maybe God was unleashing yet another flood on this world? Who would be the new Noah, folks? We think that Andy Smalls is a likely candidate. Two of every animal, including dragons, which he believes in, but not walruses, as according to Andy, those “is” fictional. 

**JENNIFER:** Yeah, that’s kinda how rain works, babe!!!!@1!!!

**BRAD:** I know, I know, it’s just.. No matter how many times it’s happened I don’t think I can ever prepare myself for those droplets, babe. They’re like little bullets, just repeatedly shooting us, y’know? 

**JENNIFER:** Aw babe, you really were scared, weren’t you?

Brad straightened his posture and puffed his shoulders and chest out like that silly ole’ bulldog feller from Tom and Jerry at this accusation. 

**BRAD:** Scared? Pfft, nah, I was just doing that to, uh, make you feel more comfortable in case you needed to scream or something. Yeah, how was my performance, babe??

**JENNIFER:** Alright, babe, whatever you say. Just know you don’t have to pretend around me like I’m one of your football buddies.

As Jenny said this, she approached a drenched Brad, put her hand on his pushed-out chest, and looked up longingly at him before speaking again. 

**JENNIFER:** So.. whaddaya wanna do, Brad??!?!?!!? You know we do have the house to ourselves.. ;)

Brad, now faced with the irresistible, killer combo of that last line and his girlfriend giving him, to borrow a phrase from an extremely heroic and banterous figure of wokeness, the ole “saddle-me-up- daddy” look, hesitated a moment before answering Jenny. 

**BRAD:** Oh, I know just the thing… 

With this, Brad decided to quit fr*icking around and suddenly swept Jenny off her feet, causing her to shriek in joyful surprise, before carrying her into the Walker’s nearby living room and tossing her passionately against the couch. The hydrophobic jock joined Jenny on the couch and began frantically searching between the cushions for something, perhaps a condom or some snack food they planned on incorporating into their love-making session (We recommend poppadoms)His search, however, seemed to be going nowhere, while he was fast running out of cushions to upend. 

**BRAD:** Babe, where the hell’s the remote??!?!? 

**JENNIFER:** You’re sitting on it you big silly.. sexy thing! 

**BRAD:** Oh shit, you right, babe! 

Brad reached under him for the remote control, which had wedged itself between his ass-cheeks (you can blame the basketball shorts for that one, folks!), and held it up for Jenny to see. 

**JENNIFER:** Come on, baby, I’m already craving it!! 

**BRAD:** That makes two of us, babe! 

Oh. 

**BRAD:** Alright, let’s get you turned on!!!@@!!!!!@##!!!!!!!

As the intern tasked with editing this script surely prepared to take out his cock, however, Brad did the unexpected and instead of using the remote to presumably recreate the infamous “Ass-to-ass” scene from Requiem for a Dream with Jenny, used it turn on the television like the slightly less infamous scene in that film in which the elderly Sara Goldfarb (insert echoes here) watched TV. 

**JENNIFER:** I hope we didn’t miss anything important!!!

**BRAD:** Nah, babe, I think we’re good. It was probably just the recap of last week’s episode, so no big deal. 

**JENNIFER:** It is if I haven’t seen last week’s episode!!!!!!11!!!1ONE!!!22

**BRAD:** Alright, alright!! I’ll just tell you what happened, okay? I’ll act it out for you, babe, with all the gunshots and zombie noises too! 

**JENNIFER:** But then I’ll miss more of this episode tonight, thus creating a self-perpetuating cycle of me missing a bit from each episode! 

**BRAD:** Shit, I hate that you right, babe! Think, Brad, think.. Oh, I’ve got it! I’ll just brief you on it when it goes to commercials! Ha! Beat that, self-perpetuating cycle! 

While they were talking shop, however, it turned out that both Jenny and Brad had missed a rather crucial three minutes of this week’s episode of the programme, Biracial Carl Vs. The Walking Dead, in which the titular character awakes to find that his group’s camp had been raided overnight by the Reckoners, a fearsome band of survivors with great bloodlust and also regular lust led by a man named Megan (it’s pronounced “Mee-gan,” alright??!) who held some pretty zany religious beliefs that are never actually explored in the show. The scene ended with Carl taking a head-count of his group and arriving at the harrowing revelation that all of the women of the group were missing, with the sole exception of the now 98-year old Carol, who, for all intents and purposes, was unrapeable, unless you were a granny-banger.

**BRAD:** ...Anyway, so last episode ends real weird, too, babe. It’s just Carl and all the other survivors going to sleep. I don’t know, it was real fuckin’ weird. Maybe it was meant to be symbolic or something. 

**JENNIFER:** I just don’t get why Morgan would open the gates like that when there’s all those walkers out there and the Reckoners. Just seems a bit DUMB to me, babe!! 

**BRAD:** Well, I think that’s where you make a crucial mistake about Morgan’s character, babe. Morgan isn’t meant to act rationally, y’know? Morgan is a wildcard, and that’s what makes him such a compelling character, at least in my opinion. He just does things, half the time without even considering the possible consequences. Morgan just doesn’t give two cr*aps what happens. So I don’t think we should dwell too much on the “why,” babe. I think so anyway. 

Having finally been brought up to speed on the events of last week’s installment of Biracial Carl vs. the Walking Dead, Jennifer turned her eyes back to the TV screen, which had finally returned to the show after a lengthy stretch of commercials. After a really sick pan down shot, the viewer was greeted with the image of Carl standing atop the hood of a rusty car with the remaining survivors all huddled around like a bunch of sheep-people, or peeps for short. Carl appeared to be in the midst of addressing the peeps in an almost Hitlerian fashion, shouting and making various gestures that actually doubled as sign language subtitles for the deaf folks in the audience. How considerate of the folks at AMC. 

**JENNIFER:** Hey, Carl kind of reminds me a bit of the Overlord in this scene!!!21!!!

On screen, the fearless leader of the good guy faction in the Walking Dead’s surprisingly limited post-apocalyptic world ended his speech by firing off several shots in the air with his “gat.” The show then switched to a shot of one of Megan’s Reckoners hearing Carl’s shots in the distance and reaching for a pair of binoculars. As Megan’s sentry went to go locate Carl and friends and then alert his boss of their not-being-dead-ness, though, the lights in Jennifer’s house started flickering before going off entirely. The TV screen soon followed, plunging the two young lovers into that great anti-Aquarius Jackson known as darkness. 

**BRAD:** I’m scared, babe!

Attempting to ignore the perverse immasculinity of her boyfriend, Jennifer quickly dashed across the hall and back into her now almost pitch-black bedroom, where she stuck her head out through the still-open window for as briefly as possible, looking down the street towards ever-more impenetrable blackness. Such was the scale of the blackout that only two or three of the near-identical houses down the left-hand side of the street could be seen before Jennifer’s field of vision started to die off in the darkness. Off in the distance, the lights of the town centre could still be seen (The Walker family and their neighbours lived in the Kingston Court housing estate outside of town, which was on a hill, then there was a dip between Kingston Court and the commercial area of town, which was on another hill, meaning some of the town’s more notable buildings, such as Thornbury’s department store, could be clearly seen at night, if they happened to be lit up. Some people liked to call the town and Kingston Court “twin peaks”, much like the 1990 David Lynch television show or the knockers of some big titted chick, but the fact of it was that no one in the town cared about Kingston Court, so it was hardly twin anything), which suggested that the fault was somewhat localised. Perhaps a tree had been knocked over onto a power line by the wind, or perhaps a lustful marauder had used the cover of the storm (Storm Ecgwynn, as named by the Ambight for Weatherlore, if you must know) to cut the lines. It was definitely the second one. Or perhaps the first. Who can really say?

**BRAD:** What’s going on, babe??

Jennifer had not heard, or, thanks to being halfway out a window, seen her beau enter the bedroom, and started with a yelp, knocking her head off the frame of the window. Brad found this quite funny (Although we at home, not liking Jennifer, may have differing opinions), and started to uncontrollably laugh at what had happened to his girlfriend, who, rubbing her head, started to see the funny side of it, too. Again, we don’t find it funny, but if you and I were Brad and Jenny, we very well might. After a few minutes worth of jolly chuckling, Jennifer decided to reply.

**JENNIFER:** It looks like the power’s off down the whole block.

**BRAD:** Aw shoot, what do we do, babe??

Jennifer then remembered that while her father had been attempting to lose weight for major heart surgery some years ago, her parents had bought one of those get-fit-to-get-fat electricity-generating exercise bikes, which he had proceeded to never use and just leave in the garage. 

**JENNIFER:** A couple of years ago ago, my mom and dad bought one of those exercise bikes that you wheel around on and it powers the place. They never used it, but it should still be there. 

**BRAD:** Where?

**JENNIFER:** The garage, dummy.

**BRAD:** Oh. You right again, babe. Finna go and do that.

It should be mentioned at this stage that Brad was, in fact, black. Well, black on the inside. He was something of a wigger, we should say, but that was only a natural result of the afrocentric worldview that had allowed T’Challa and Kamala Harris to literally come second in a three-way Presidential race, and not because Brad was actually transracial or something. Brad headed back out the door while Jenny watched him go, smiling. [Lightning flashed outside, briefly illuminating a trenchcoat wearing figure standing under the pouring rain outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QEVZ-9-nX0). By the time Jenny had stopped gormlessly gazing into the vacant void that had, under the cover of darkness, become her hallway, and turned back around, the night stalker was climbing in through her window, one leg in, and one to go. The trenchcoat was ‘complimented’, naturally, by a fedora, under which he appeared to be wearing some kind of dark “war gimp” getup - black cargo trousers, a bulletproof vest, and to top it all off, in lieu of a gimp mask, was one of the gas variety. Jenny screamed and fell backwards against her wall, in abject terror, we assume. When the intruder spoke, he had a dark, deep growl, and what seemed like a Darth Vader-esque loudness to his breaths. 

**NIGHT STALKER:** **I told you that you were gonna get yours, whore!**

**JENNIFER:** Help! Help!

**NIGHT STALKER:** **Goddamn, you’re a pathetic fucking slut!**

The Night Stalker reached down and pulled Jennifer up with a single powerful tug. Jenny attempted to fight back against him, kicking at his willy, but it seemed that he was wearing a strong, defensive codpiece. TNS (Not to be confused with TBS, which rapes us in a different way) tossed Jenny onto her bed, before jumping on top of her to halt any attempts at scrambling away she might have made. Pressing Jenny’s head down onto her pillows to stop her from screaming, The Night Stalker pulled out a series of rope bindings from his pocket, and in short work, he had tied Jenny to her own bedposts. It’s somewhat ironic that the very pieces of wood that had kept her asleep for so long would now be party to another piece of wood keeping her awake forever. Well, that’s not irony, but you know the deal. As this was going on, Brad, who had been alerted by Jenny’s screaming, came running back into the room, holding the most feared weapon of all: an apple. Brad let out a scream of PROTECTIVE ANGER and tried to attack the Night Stalker with the fruit, but the goblin of carnality pulled an M9 out of his coat pocket, and pointed it right at Brad’s chest, causing him to freeze.

**NIGHT STALKER:** **Not so fast, buddy. Get into the corner.**

Brad briefly hesitated, but soon caved to the gunman’s demands, being walked back towards the wall by the intruder.

**JENNIFER:** Brad, hel -

**NIGHT STALKER:** **Shut it, bitch, or you’ll both get it!**

Jennifer whimpered, but remained silent.

**NIGHT STALKER:** **Get down on your knees, buddy.**

The Night Stalker prodded his gun into Brad’s stomach, and despite the fact that his heart was telling him to try and fight, and half of his head was telling him that the intruder would surely whip his dick out the second he got onto the ground, the backup captain of the St. Paul’s football team did exactly as he had been told, and soon he too was tied down and blindfolded. 

**NIGHT STALKER:** **You fucking coward! You’re going to watch as I rape your girl, Brad! And if I hear any movement, I’m gonna cap you!**

**BRAD:** No!

Jenny tried to let out another cry for help, but the Night Stalker was on her in seconds, and stuffed a gag into her mouth. With Jennifer and Brad both subdued, the demon of domination wasted no time in cutting open a hole in her denim jeans with a trusty pair of snippers, pawing at the “feminine aspects of her body (Eagan, 2017)” through her water-stained panties. 

**NIGHT STALKER:** **Bitch. You’re wet. Fucking whore.**

Jenny tried to scream through the gag over her mouth as she felt cold metal on her inner thigh, but she could functionally do nothing as the Night Stalker cut away her underwear, exposing her buttocks and vagina to the cold breeze still blowing in from outside. As Jenny tried and failed to do what she’d always been advised, and try and think about something else (Like the Walking Dead, maybe?) the Night Stalker removed his helmet and pressed his face up against Jenny’s thigh, before taking a long sniff of her BABY MAKER and ANAL GIBBER. He seemed to like what he smelt, for he was soon licking his lips like an Ethiopian in KFC.

**NIGHT STALKER:** **[Time for dinner, you whore.](https://open.spotify.com/track/4jsviyzIo6u9KCFKZpdDTE?si=XJcY2PZYQxeYOvJ5mN71Qg)**

---

**Mount Doom**

Far more nefarious things than the Night Stalker’s sexcapades were going on elsewhere. Mount Doom, so named for its resemblance to the headquarters of the Dark Lord Sauron in the Lord of the Rings franchise, and quite possibly literally the same mountain, was host to some of them. Situated in The Wilderness (Capital T, capital W), Mount Doom was host to the sprawling, labyrinthine fortress lair of the Necromancer, the dark rock-wizard Jimmy Page, who, from his mountaintop castle, headed a vaguely tribe-affiliated cabal of satanists and other individuals interested in the occult known as the Alliance of Evildoers (Do*ing* or do*ers*, you might ask? Jimmy changes it depending on his mood), who caused great strife across the entire world and beyond. At present, Page was sitting in a red velvet armchair in his study, absentmindedly playing a few blues chords on his guitar. In front of him was a groveling cardinal - Cardinal Omella, Juan José Omella i Omella - whose hands were covered in blood red enough to match his robes. 

**OMELLA OMELLA:** I am so sorry, Master Page. I am so, so sorry. Please..

Omella crawled towards Page, trying to grab onto his leg, but his hand was roughly kicked away.

**OMELLA OMELLA:** I did not mean for it to happen like this, Master....please...in the name of the Great Satan, forgive me….

Page looked down at the priest, his eyes filled with contempt.

**PAGE:** Well, if it was up to me, mate, *I’d* forgive you, but reason and logic dictates that you be punished. You were to oversee the delivery, and yet through the shaking of your hands, your two blood-soaked hands, you botched it! 

Page rose out of his seat as he raged at Omella’s failure, tossing his guitar to one side. He would not be needing it for what was to come. Its power would be wasted on someone like the Cardinal. 

**OMELLA OMELLA:** Please, master...I tried to deliver the child, oh, how I tried!

**PAGE:** Sixteen times now! Sixteen times in sixteen years, you and others of your order have failed to deliver into this world the anti-christ! I’m beginning to think your Catholic Church isn’t as dedicated to villainy as it once was! 

**OMELLA OMELLA:** Please, sir...Francis, he has been trying to stop us...but we remain strong, as Benedict and John Paul would have wanted!

**PAGE:** Who cares about what Ratzinger wants? What about what I want, Juan? I am the Vicar of the Black Mass, and yet -

Page clenched his fists and raised them up towards his face.

**PAGE:** And yet my underlings cannot even summon onto earth an incarnate Nephilim! How many times have I got to explain the process? Approaching June 25th, you must take the ovaries of a butchered goat and a virginal girl -

**OMELLA OMELLA:** Could...could you not do it yourself, My Lord?

Page flew into a rage at this, and kicked the kneeling Omella right in the neck, blowing him over.

**PAGE:** DON’T YOU THINK I WOULD IF I COULD?! An act of….such malign majesty...if I was able to...you were here for a reason, Cardinal.

The great Necromancer stood over the Cardinal, casting a long, spooky shadow. Just then, however, as he prepared to dispose of Omella-Omella for his general incompetence, Page’s attention was drawn to the door to his study, which now made the kind of noise typical of someone knocking on it (because someone, in fact, was knocking on it). He then opened the door to find one of his many housechurls standing on the other side. Judging by the fact that the churl was breathing heavily and drenched in sweat, Page surmised that he had something urgent to relay to him, or perhaps that he had simply decided, like Dale MacLachlan earlier this chapter, to run laps around the fortress. 

**PAGE:** What in Evil’s name could you possibly want, underling??!

**CHURL:** My dark lord, I regret to disturb you in the midst of a surely nefarious deed, but we’ve received a message for you, from Levi of the Tribe!

**PAGE:** Hm...

Page stroked his chin most wickedly, glancing back and forth between the unwashed chrul at his door and the ketchup kovered kardinal. Making a decision, Page ducked out the door into the pristine white chamber outside his room, from which various parts of the fortress could be reached, and called over two spear-wielding guards that had been walking passed. The guardsmen hurriedly raised their hands in a [satanic salute](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/satanic-091228011928-phpapp02/95/satanic-5-728.jpg?cb=1261963195) before heading over into Page’s study. 

**PAGE:** Imps, I want you to take this man -

Page pointed at the Cardinal.

**PAGE:** - to your commanding Cyclops, and tell him that I have remanded him in a punishing custody until I can figure out the method of execution I’d like to use on him. 

**IMPS:** Yes, dark one!

The guardsmen delivered another pair of satanic salutes to Jimmy, before grabbing Omella Omella and hauling him out the door. Before they were fully out of the room, though, Page stopped them.

**PAGE:** Make sure that your leader knows that, if he were to take any vials of blood from this man for ritual purposes, I would see no issue with that.

**IMPS:** Understood, dark one!

The imps departed, leaving Page alone with the messenger churl.

**PAGE:** Alright, you unwashed wretch, fetch me an Audiovisual Israelite Transmitter. Oh, and, there’ll be extra slime for you to bathe in if you keep this meeting with Levi entirely secret, am I understood?

**CHURL:** Extra...slime, sir? For me…? You mean it?

**PAGE:** And muck, excrement, and much else besides. You will be the most disgusting and filthy creature under the influence of Evil, I dare say!

**CHURL:** You are the most ruthless and despicable evildoer to ever do evil, sir! I shall fetch the Audiovisual Israelite Transmitter as per your devious bidding!

The housechurl, whose mind was surely now filled with thoughts of bathing in slime and shite and the like, threw up a Satanic salute before rushing off to go grab the Levitron, which he wheeled into the study some minutes later and plugged into the wall. 

**PAGE:** Excellent, my most obedient henchman, you shall be rewarded handsomely with much slime! Now away with you - I must speak with the Elder Levi.

**CHURL:** Heil evil, oh dark one! 

The churl did one last salute and promptly left Page with the Heebish device. Page picked up one of his guitars from the corner, and fired it at the TV.

**PAGE:** By the infernal power of evil, I command ye to turn on!

The Audiovisual Israelite Transmitter could hardly argue against such a demand, and moments later flickered to life, with Levi’s cyclopsian dome visible on the other end. 

**PAGE:** Levi, what’s the matter this time? 

**LEVI:** Shalom, goy. I’m coming to you with anuddah offah. 

**PAGE:** Your offers never fail to entertain me, Levi, so out with it, and we shall see about striking this yiddish bargain.

**LEVI:** Goy, you’re the only one I can hire for this. Not even all the gold we heebs horde could pay for anyone else. I need you to eliminate that mashugana, Shlomo. He’s been acting like a real schmo lately, but he seems to still think he’s some kinda macher. 

**PAGE:** I’ll do it.

**LEVI:** Really? Just like that? No questions? No asking about the reward?

**PAGE:** Evil is its own reward. One day, you Jews will learn that.

**LEVI:** Oy gevalt, you goyim have no mercantile sense!

**PAGE:** Perhaps not, Levi, but we do have a great affinity for the darker arts. 

Page then began to play the guitar riff from D’yer Mak’er, one of the lesser Led Zeppelin songs to be sure, and threw his head back, cackling in a way that would make you surprised to find out about his gentile heritage.

**The Walker Residence**

[Brad grunted as he thrust deeper into his girlfriend’s ass.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpDa-c-4Mc) This was no passionate lovemaking, however, as seen in the mixture of tears and mascara streaming down Jenny’s face and the fact that the Night Stalker was still present, albeit standing in the corner with his back turned to the young couple and his pants down to his ankles. His rapid wrist movements and savage grunting telling us more about what he was doing than we need say, so we’ll leave it there. After about another minute of hole boring on the part of Brad, the breeder of the relationship appeared to have neared climax. 

**BRAD:** Fuck, I’m gonna…

**JENNIFER:** Don’t do it, Brad…

[As if alerted by Brad’s moaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdSWaIvyQ3o), the Night Stalker suddenly turned around, his monstrous cock dripping with precum that connected to his hand like cobwebs from some liquid spider. The Night Stalker dived across the room and jumped on top of the naked Brad, forcing him down onto and deeper inside of the crushed Jennifer. Brad couldn’t hold it in any longer, and came right inside his girlfriend, prostate spasming. Thanks in large part to the religious policies of Father Damien, neither the bill or abortion would be an option if she was impregnated. 

**NIGHT STALKER:** **GODDAMN YOU FUCKING PREP!**

The Night Stalker pushed Brad even further down, crawling over him like Gollum after the one ring, except our villain was only after one ring: The one of flesh around Brad’s asshole. Already at full-mast thanks to his half-hour long (and somehow anticlimactic) wank session, the Night Stalker thrust his cock inside Brad like a knife into porkchop. Brad cried out at the complete lack of lube, and his asshole, which was extremely tight, began to bleed from the sheer length and girth of his assaulter’s dong. The Night Stalker splashed up and down on top of Brad as if he were Patrick Star in one of those episodes of Spongebob where they accidentally wash ashore for a few minutes, before cuming right inside his ass. Feeling the hot baby-juice go up a hole where no babies had ever come from, Brad started to blubber and cry, like Spongebob in one of those episodes where he *really* cries. The Night Stalker let out a moan of pleasure, before pushing Brad off and onto the floor, cum dripping out of his butthole.

**NIGHT STALKER:** **Take that, bitch. I made you my bitch. My cum owns you, Brad.**

Jennifer, by now a bigger wreck than the Titanic, had briefly hoped that the Night Stalker’s climax would be the end of her ordeal, but those hopes were dashed, again, like the Titanic, when the Night Stalker turned her around into a missionary position, and rammed his shit and blood covered dick right into her vagina.

**NIGHT STALKER:** **Enjoy that yeast infection, whore!**

The Night Stalker spat right into her face, and started to slowly thrust inside of her. As Jennifer lay there, under the colossal weight of Gomez’ heir, and with him ramming in and out of her, she came to a horrific realisation:

The Night Stalker had no refractory period. It would be a long night."

I am a college student, (M19, 5'9"", 159lb) got a 2-month internship this summer starting in late May and ending in late July. My class load has been pretty intense this semester and I have only been able to hit the gym twice a week, I'm intermediate on a Pull-Push dumbbell program.

I have seen slight gains these past few months, but would like to really tone down my physique for the summer in the two months during the internship. To do this I plan to hit the gym 3 times a week and incorporate running/bodyweight exercises like this:




Monday --   PUSH (Chest, tri, shoulders, (traps))


Tuesday --  2-3miles outdoor run + core routine 


Wednesday -- PULL (Back routine, biceps)


Thursday -- 2-3miles outdoor run + core routine


Friday --    PUSH (Chest, tri, shoulders, (traps))


I would alternate the push-pull split each week of course, so that I'm doing 3 days of each every 2 weeks.




If I want to cut down that last bit of body fat over 2 months, and still maintain size/strength (and possibly gain a bit) is this the right general program I should follow? Of course I would be keeping watch of my diet, which would probably be less cals then now, but more protein (I'm aiming for around 80-100g a day).

Any advice, comments, suggestions greatly appreciated."

A little background story: I grew up in a controlling and unhealthy household. For all my life I’ve had low confidence issues but I’m trying to change for the better with the support I have gotten. 

---

I will call him [29M] “Andrew”. We were in the same program together and had our fair share of discussing our boy/girl issues along with other life problems with each other.

In college days, we were pretty close and freely express our opinions and jokes. But after some time, I noticed that he started to disregard my comfort zones no matter how many times I brought it up. For instance, he uses my laptop without asking me, touches my jacket fur (which was white and I try to keep it clean), and made a rude remark towards me in front of our class by saying I was “mental” for everyone to laugh about.

Those incidents I felt hurt and wanted to discuss it with him, only for him to tell me I should be less sensitive and take it in a joking manner. Over time, I decided to let it go because I didn’t want to have negative thoughts bother me. Was it really a small, simple joke?

Our last semester involved finding unpaid internships to graduate after, and Andrew was worried he will not be able to get a placement. He requested for me to make a recommendation on his behalf at my internship, which I did because I wanted to help him succeed… (bad idea, I know, I regretted).

---

Things at the internship were going smoothly at first until we had small disputes between us. For instance, I was working on a health project where they hired a doctor to come into the office and we were gathered to collect some information. I asked the doctor questions, and while the doctor responded in a professional manner, Andrew leaned into me to whisper a few things I didn’t manage to catch because my attention was at the doctor’s response. 

Andrew was hurt by my course of action because I prioritized the doctor over him, so he decided not to speak to me for the rest of that week. I wasn’t sure how to approach this situation because personal issues should rather be solved elsewhere, rather than in the office. He ignored my questions through text until Friday came along and he brought up the topic of “Hey, how come you are ignoring me?”. I kept it light and friendly by responding “Hey, we’re at work, chit-chats can be made outside of office hours!”.

All the things I try to do, he will criticize me for and made me feel small all the same. He tries to tell me he knows more about certain subjects and that my personal views don’t match up to his. 

Until the final week of our internship, I lent Andrew money because he asked to use it over the weekend. On Monday, I was keeping it light by asking him if he remembers about the money he borrowed. I wanted to be friendly to avoid any more confrontations and any arguments of any sort.

He forgot, and my response to that was light and I assured him that it was okay, people forget, he can return it after office hours but preferably by the end of that day. We then focused on our tasks at hand and didn’t talk much (I’m not the talkative type and he knows this for three years). He took my silence as a bad sign and got angry over it, no matter how I try to assure him. I said in an assertive tone that it should be right for people to return their money when borrowing it. Perhaps I was just looking too deeply into this money manners deal. 

Our administrator overheard our little dispute and was surprised when Andrew said I should not take our friendship for granted, and that I lack respect for him. At the end of the week, she came up to me and said it is not good for me to abuse friendships. I didn’t want to drag our co-workers into our disputes, I didn't tell her anything, and decided to let it go. She said it's not okay to cut relationships.


**I have a few questions for you Redditors…**

Knowing that everyone is imperfect with flaws, at what point do you deem it as a 'toxic' friendship? How do you tell if they are good friends or not? Where should you cut the line or distance yourself from them? 

I know I put myself in a bad spot right from the beginning but would like to know how to properly stand up for myself.

Anyway, we've gotten 2 more scenes done, but these scenes have been getting longer. For example, one of the scenes we did had 100 files to translate, so that's about 10 times the average length of the previous scenes, but on the bright side we have only 13 scenes left to translate, so it's not so bad. Still, these scenes are gonna be a pain in the ass to get through since all of our translators still have their own personal lives to worry about before the project except for MSLabo. He seems to have no trouble at all with this, but since he's native Japanese and pretty fluent in English, it's probably no problem for him at all. 

I don't know if anyone here cares, but I've also started making a fan game for Touhou and I'm sincerely hoping it turns out well. I'm also doing an internship for the summer at video game studio, so I'm probably gonna be busier than I was in school, but at least I won't be depressed working on this stuff than I was in school. 

Anyway, I'm sorry once again for leaving for a while and putting lalasa in charge to write updates. I know they're not as well written as MY updates, but now that I say that, she'll probably point out a bunch of grammatical and punctual errors from this update in the comments or something.

A few quick things I'm generally already aware of: 

1. History of layoffs (EMC merger, the dot-com bust, 08 downturns, maybe they just felt like it?), 
2. In round rock (I appreciate in the burbs and the city)
3. Fortune 50 company, many individual experiences, cog-in-machine, corporate drones, etc.
4. I've married into Austin ""localness"", so I guess that gives me a small pass from the ""don't move here"" crowd? I learned about this thing from a guy who moved to Austin from elsewhere, and within a week was posting Insta's with hashtags ""don't move here""

Once March break started, he came back into my life and asked to take me out to dinner, which I agreed to. In April, he almost left because we got into a misunderstanding and I said something wrong. When I said something wrong, he used that as a reason to let go of me. Long story short was that he internalizes things but I am more confrontational. He admitted he associated negative thoughts with me because he was upset with me, which was why he thought he didn’t like me and thought he didn’t want a relationship. He also mentioned that he has been around unstable people all his life which was why he couldn’t express his feelings about certain things. He didn’t end up leaving and said he realizes he actually does like me and was sorry about everything. Now, these past few weeks have been great, talking every day and hanging out when we can. However, he is leaving for a 4-month internship and I wanted to know when I stood. He said he did not know what he wanted to do, and thinks he should talk about all this to someone before making a decision because there are things he is confused about. What should I do? Give him some time or make a decision myself?

First off, thanks everyone in advance for taking the time to read this. It really means a lot :D

Just as some quick background: I'm a 21 year old American university student (home university is in Upstate NY) currently halfway through an international internship in southwestern France. I have the ability to take a few weekend trips to nearby countries and love the idea of taking some time in Switzerland. However, I'm very new to international travel and wouldn't mind some advice! Here's all the info I can share:

I've done some preliminary research and saw that the Lucerne/Interlaken region looks beautiful. I'm all about nice views and beautiful scenery: a weekend laying back with an amazing backdrop is a weekend well spent. Are there any other well-known areas in Switzerland that are ""cozy"", for a lack of a better term? I would not mind in the slightest visiting some of the larger cities, however I think I'm biased towards more rural and areas that are more ""quaint"".

I'm not opposed to visiting multiple areas either: apparently the Swiss public transportation system is fantastic, however I wasn't sure exactly how to tackle that. Any advice on what I should be looking for to purchase in that regard? If the transportation allows for free roaming, I would certainly be okay with visiting many different areas.

In terms of budget: I am very fortunate to have a semi-deep pocket (with many thanks to this internship) however I would still like to be efficient with spending. Any money I don't use can be saved for when I return to the States, so although I wouldn't mind spending some extra cash for a great experience, I would prefer to not go over-board.

^ on a similar note to this: are there any cheaper alternatives to housing/overnight stay? A few friends have mentioned AirBnB and ""hostels""? I have never used them but people have said that they prefer these over traditional hotels and the like. Any advice/help on this front? 

On a small side note: Ireland is another place I thought about visiting - I have done very little research in that regard in terms of the specific locales to see, but my interests are still the same! For any of you who have visited Ireland, where were your favorite places to stay?

Thank you so much again for your time everyone. Let me know what you think!!

This happened two years ago. My JNMIL is my BF's mom and she has severe drinking and narassistic issues. My SO has so much mental strength just from living with this woman for so long. 

At this time she had a breathalizer in her car that had to be blown into every 15 min.   A few months before she got a DWI and side swiped a whole bunch of cars. This wasn't the first time either. Her and I get along for the most part but when she starts yapping, I will bark back. I am not intimidated by her in the least. 

Anyway, at this time I was looking for a used car, because mine had died. My BF was given me rides to work for two weeks now. The car hunt was a huge stress for me because I was working a part-time internship right out of college. My BF called me at work to say his mom and him had found me a used SUV at my price range and we could go look at it when I got off work. I was so exited!!! He picks me up and we head to his house to get his mom. She wanted to come with us. When we got there, she wasn't. Her car was there but her purse and phone gone. We called her but no answer. We wait about 30 minutes out of kindness. Sometimes her friends come pick her up and take her to get smokes. Well after the 30 min we decided to head out without her. 

Walking out the front door, a SUV come tearing down the road into the drive way. She is driving it and I can already tell she is wild. Her hair is all flowing and her skin is clammy. We are in disbelief, and run up to the car. She is DRUNK. At 3pm on a Tuesdays. 

She let's us know this is know her car and she paid for it herself(~2k) and better luck next time. My BF is fuming mad and tells her to get out of the car. She tells some rubbish about us not loving and supporting her. We run towards the car and she backs out the drive way and takes off again. FUCK.

 BF calls his dad to let him know the situation but he wont be home from work for 3 more hours. So we start driving around town in BF car looking for her. We went to all local dive bars and places she would be. Small town, so want a long look. Couldn't find her anywhere. We went home. Called ppl, waited for BFs dad. Searched more. Bfs dad got a hold of her late at night on the phone. She said she was keeping the car, he said dont come me home then. She has a ghost all the next day. We wore worried sick knowing she would go to jail if caught. 

Well about 4am the next morning she is found on the couch in the living room. Passed out for sure. It took us all that morning of calling ppl to figure out what happened. Turns out her and her buddies divided to blow the car up at a local drive bar and have a little party about it. Then someone they new towed it off to a junk yard. The bartender of the dive bar is who told us. So no car for me at all, and crazy ass is back home acting like nothing happened. BF dad just let it go and I still can't believe it. 

Sorry so long,  I could go on forever. This woman is also 90lbs and thinks she is the best human in the world because she helps at the animal shelter. No you do mandatory community service at the one place that would take you. "

After the post, I addressed some of the problems, but they regressed into arguments and my boyfriend blatantly told he was not going to change. So I stopped bringing it up and started asking myself if I was willing to accept that for possibly the rest of my life. I realized I wasn't, so I am planning on ending the relationship.

He is very sweet to me and I can see how much he truly loves me, so I would like to break up respectfully. We live together in his family-owned place, so he will not have to deal with rent once we break up. I am temporarily moving in early June for an internship this summer. I promised to attend his piano recital that is occurring five days before I leave, so I was thinking about having the conversation one or two days after that. My parents live in the area and are helping me move, so I am bringing my belongings there before I leave and I can stay there for a few days before I go.

We have not been arguing and I have been trying to enjoy my last days with him, so he may be caught off-guard. It may also be unfair to string him along for the next month. This is my first relationship and my first break-up, so I am really unsure of what to say and when to say it.

Any ideas?"

It was a time where my mom disowned me for calling the police on my step dad for domestic violence. It was a time where I lost my home, money, and even my promising internship for that summer.

He's helped me a lot, and the past year a half with him before this, all was great. I genuinely felt loved and cared for. The first time I thought I was brave enough to let you go was when I first found out you cheated on me. I was leaving his house, I packed my clothes.. everything. That night I rushed him to the hospital. Turns out, his appendix bursted. It was a good thing we went to the hospital. I stayed at the hospital with him.. cared for him. Even got his parents from South Dakota to come to Atlanta. On the way back from staying at the hospital for 3 days, he told me he would never forget this moment. And that he would only love me. We spent the next few weeks together with his parents.

We stayed together. He cheated on me again. And again. He would do it knowing that I would know. But every time I caught him he told me he only loved me. He told me that he just wants to have fun, that in the end he only wants to be with me. I kept believing him.

He gives me all I want. Money was never an issue for him. He helps me pay for rent, buys me food, it's never a no for him. He built this fantasy life for me. And before someone says i'm a gold digger or a materialist, I never asked for it. When we met we we're both broke college students. And he found a really good job to support himself and more. I think he gives me the life I can't have right now because he knows how much he's hurt me.

I got diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and C\-PTSD. Not just from him cheating, but past events in my life that's scarred me. Even with this.. knowing this.. he continued cheating. I failed one of my college classes because I found after sex photos of him and another girl, and couldn't focus on my exam. I have to graduate a semester late now.

I agreed to be in an open relationship with him, just so we can be together. I met other guys, slept with other guys, but now I just feel that I did that cause I wanted to tell myself, hey you can't be mad at him now, cause you're doing it too. But it's all wrong. What i want is a committed relationship. I talked to one of the girls he was seeing, and she told me that he told her that he's single, that he's just out for fun so don't get serious with him. She told me that I need to get over a guy like that. She told me she and i are worth so much more than a guy that knowingly hurts others. He become more thick\-skinned with his affairs. I found a bra in his house that wasn't mine, he would have phone conversations his other women privately when we're together, he would go on out of state EDM concerts with them. All of this he tries to ""hide"" but when I confront him he says that he doesnt want to tell me straight up because he doesnt want me to get hurt.. because those girls are not important to him. because he loves me.

It's always in my mind. We're not going to last. He tells me we'll be together, start a family, that this is all a phase, that he doesn't want to be with these other women. But i know it's not going to stop. I know that i'm worth so much more. I know that I don't want a future with a man like that.

But why am i not brave enough? I tried breaking up with him countless of times, but each time I come running back. I want to be brave enough."

Their code is very hacky and it seems like they were a quick final addition or they were coded by an intern. When Mario is standing on one of these platforms, the game doesn’t draw Mario to the screen like usual, but rather creates a copy of him, and draws that to the screen instead so it looks like Mario is on the platform. You can see this in effect when you land or jump off of one of these platforms. Because of this extra work, routines that do things relative to Mario and Yoshi’s position need to be adjusted to the copy of Mario instead of the real Mario. This includes the Yoshi-spitting-an-item-out routine that we talked about. When Yoshi spits out an item while on the brown swinging platform, the stack pointer is 01E2 instead of 01EB. Now that value modified in the stack at 01E3 actually modifies this routine’s return address."

I would have to be blind not to find you attractive, with your pale skin and blue eyes, lustrous red hair, soft and heavy breasts, thin waist and curved hips. The problem is that I'm just *dying* to have you. 

I shouldn't be. I'm married with two kids, and while I'm not old enough to be your father I'm old enough that many would consider me a pervert for lusting after you. For undressing you with my eyes, or for the way my pulse quickens when you walk by, hips swaying and breasts subtly bouncing. I have everything to lose by chasing after you, absolutely everything. I should stay away and never look back. And yet...

I can't stop thinking about you. In my tamer moments I focus on your adorable face and countenance, your lilting and feminine laugh and the dimples that come out on your cheeks when you smile. Or on spoiling you with gifts, flowers, and expensive vacations and seeing the joy they'd bring you. 

More often than not, though, my thoughts dwell on taking ownership of your body. Bending you over and lifting your skirt, grabbing a handful of your copper hair, caressing your petite waist, back and shoulders and occasionally squeezing your heavy tits with their pale, pink nipples while I rail you from behind. Having you get on your knees and take my throbbing cock into your waiting mouth, or between your tits, and letting me unload all my sexual tension into your mouth. Or lying you on your back and burying my face between your pale thighs, teasing your clit with my tongue while I work your pussy and ass with my fingers, not relenting until I've left you a panting, trembling mess... I want to hear the sounds you make and see the look on your face when I give you a toe clenching, spine-cracking orgasm. 

I have a successful career and a family to think of here, but I don't care. Everything to lose or not, you are all I can think about. If having you is wrong, I don't want to be right. 

Maybe you're one of my students, or an intern at my office, or even the babysitter. Tell me your name and how you'd like us to meet, and let's see where this takes us. Hope to see some orange envelopes soon! "

My situation: 

I don't know if my class schedule in my main degree will let me get an internship this summer, but I need at least some of the benefits. So I'm interested in connecting with someone that may be a little more advanced than me and lets simulate it as best as we can.

Process:

We'll get together, chat a bit, and see if we click, decide on a internship to follow, a schedule we can keep over the next few months, and then create as many mini projects that we can from it in a way that we can show some results for the next application round. We would tie together our resources and connections and have people we can call on or meet up with once a week, that can help us (past professors, student higher than us, industry people we know). 
I am not proficient in many cs things and definitely want to start off the summer going over code fundamentals with as many little practice problems that we can get in. Then I would like to move to the small programs as listed below in the actual internship, and then finally I would want to make the rounds presenting what we did.

In the following internship, there are technologies that I have never really worked with, I want to do some crash courses together, watch tutorials, go through documentation together, then we can start designing something to get into coding it together.  


Here is an example internship:

Help design and develop a novel bioinformatics platform with the capability of ingesting large amounts of unstructured data to provide personalized insights at the molecular level.
Work alongside other team members in Computational Biology and Data Science in an agile environment to deliver an enterprise-grade product in an iterative manner.
Design interfaces and advanced data visualizations to identify signal from noise in large genomic data sets

Requirements:

Outstanding programming and problem solving skills

Experience programming in a modern object oriented programming language

Experience in User Interface languages/frameworks such as NodeJS and ReactJS.

Experience in agile environments and comfort with quick iterations

Experience with open-source technologies like Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra, Kafka and ElasticSearch

Experience with AWS and Docker

Experience with processing and manipulating large data sets

Goal-oriented thinking

Great problem solving skills

Self-driven and works well in an interdisciplinary team with minimal direction

Experience with communicating insights and presenting concepts to a diverse audience

Strong desire to build products that will save lives and change the course of cancer

Hello! I am seeking an opportunity as a front end developer. I am available to work local to Seattle, or remotely, or up for relocation if that is offered. I am up for fulltime, internship, 30/60/90 day trial run. My projects are front end oriented, but I have studied a few languages c, c#, python, and studied OOP, mvc, design patterns, algorithms and datastructures, and a few frameworks like react and rails. I am capable of more than just a website builder :)

PROGRAM FUNCTIONALITY:

Essentially there are 4 variables that can be input into a form, and by hitting the calculate button it should be able to assess which variables are used in order to solve for the rest.

I have the variables; wage, margin, cost, and salary respectively. and I came up with the following solution, which doesn't work:

If someone can point me in the right direction i would greatly appreciate it



 	switch(wage &amp;&amp; salary &amp;&amp; margin &amp;&amp; cost) {

8gtdvl,1,2018-05-03,Investment Management Career Advice,DrewKurt,SecurityAnalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/8gtdvl/investment_management_career_advice/,"I have to make a career decision and am seeking advice as a frequenter of this sub. I'm a university student set to graduate this month with a Bachelors in Econ. I have buy side ER internship experience and passed CFA L1 in December. 

I'm considering staying in college for 2 more years to complete another Bachelors in Applied Math. I feel this would help me as an analyst (or PM in the future) with building models and understanding financial markets. The program also has a computational/statistical aspect. I also think having the quant credential would give me a competitive edge farther down the line. 

I just received a full time offer at a small but reputable sell-side shop. The pay/bonus structure is good, offered to pay for the CFA exams, and there is high potential for upward mobility. They don't offer part time, but offer an internship program, however they told me the internship doesn't involve a lot of advanced work. 

Am I shooting myself in the foot by turning down an offer like this to study math? They need an answer within 24 hours and I'm admittedly a little panicked. If anyone has any input on this it would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a CS Master's student, and I was wondering if anyone knew of any companies that were looking for interns for this upcoming summer in and around Olympia? I know there are some government internships, but I just wanted to cover my bases.

I like computer vision and machine learning and have a background in computational biology, but I'd reaaaaally like to avoid looking for internships in Seattle (or north of Tacoma, in general) if I can help it. 

Thank you so much! 😸"
8gv9t5,11,2018-05-03,Mixed week at work. Need to vent.,Emtgacc,MtF,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/8gv9t5/mixed_week_at_work_need_to_vent/,"So we had some new team members this week, mostly interns, one if them is trans, not obviously, but I'm sure I've seen them post selfies on reddit in the past and I think I recognised them from that. Nice for me to not feel so alone, not totally sure of the best way to introduce myself as we're unlikely to be working directly together. Being twice her age and still presenting male it could look a little weird if I seek her out as well. 

And then one of our managers sent out a reminder for a Star Wars themed team photo tomorrow, that's cool, but the picture he used wasn't great, bearded guy in a Leia costume wearing an 'it's a trap' badge. :(  So I've spent some time talking to HR educating them in the hope they'll be able to talk to management.  Funny how such a small thing which was clearly not intended to be malicious can make you feel so crappy.

This on top of finding out my orchi paperwork got misplaced for 2 months and my referral only just went through despite having my assessment back in late Feb. 

Don't know where I'm going with this, it's not like any of this is major compared to the struggles some go through, I just needed to vent."
8gvizk,4,2018-05-03,F4A - Down by the wharf.,amyamybamy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8gvizk/f4a_down_by_the_wharf/,"I lick my lips and rub at my crotch as the car slowly creeps along the street, gazing at the whores gathered along the sidewalk. People say to stay out of the dock district at night, they just want all the fun to themselves! 

""What about this one, Amy?"" Jessica says from the backseat. Natalie sits in the front, white as a sheet and wide eyed. Shes only been working with us girls in the office for a few weeks, intern. We found out she was a virgin and knew she needed her cherry popped. Would make her more fun to party with. 

""Nah, had him before. Fucking whiny bitch. Sounds like a woman when he cums."" 

This makes Jessica cackle and roll around in the back, spilling some beer on the seat. ""Shit. Pass me that cloth, Natalie.""

""Here we go..."" I've spotted some boys I haven't seen before. What sluts! Tight little boy shorts, mesh tops if they are wearing anything at all. Big strong arms, abs you could grate cheese on. Yeah, these lads will do. 

Pulling up to the side of the street, a tall one soon struts over to poke his head in the rolled down window. 

""Well ain't you a cutie, darling."" I purr. ""How much."" 

""How much you got?"" He grins, voice low. Cheeky bitch, would slap him around if there weren't any others. 

""Let's see what we're paying for first."" 

He reaches in to his denim and tugs them down for a quick flash. *Nice*. It looked big and he was circumcised. I prefer them with skin but these street walkers, you had to be careful. Some of them were disgusting. 

""What'd'ya think, Natalie? Good for a first time?"" 

Natalie was just gawking and blushing, Jessica spoke up instead. 

""He's good, hasn't been on the streets for long. No bruises or nothing."" Addressing the prostitute she continues, ""You go easy on Natalie, she doesn't enjoy every minute then we're not paying a thing."" 

""Hang on."" I run a finger down the whore's face. ""You do anal, darling?""

His face fell, guys don't like anal as a rule. I had never managed to get my frigid husband to put in my asshole. Fucking waste of a man. If they aren't screwing you or carrying things for you what use are they? Should get a divorce, find a fella that shuts up and puts it where I tell him. 

""That'll be double..."" He says quietly. 

""Fine, get in the back with my friend.""

Jessica opens the door for the slut and pulls him in, tugging off her skirt once the car is moving. 

""You can blow me until we get somewhere we can really party."" She giggles. ""You do like to party right?"" 

""Yeah, I like to party but um... my mommy said to get the money off you girls before I do anythi-""

""Don't be whiny bitch."" I growl. ""Blow my friend, you'll get your money. You think we're not honest?"" 

""No."" He sighs, bending over to start licking Jessica's cunt. 

***

Opposite world. Who're you? I want well thought out replies but they don't have to carry on directly from this one since I sorta controlled the prostitute. Plus I don't really want to write three different characters so unless you are willing to share control of Jessica and Natalie, could be another night on the docks when I'm alone for one idea. Or any other you can come up with that is creative with in a world in which women are the gross, dominant gender and men get to deal with the harassment, objectification and sexism. A crossdresser would actually be perceived more like a woman who was butch for example. A dominant man is the fetish sex worker, not a woman. Pegging would be a very submissive thing for a woman to do, penetrating instead of being the one penetrated. See what you can do with that.

Obviously mostly looking for men but won't say no to a *creative* woman.

8gxm7o,21,2018-05-04,What do you think the writers are up to now?,UltimateLazer,OverwatchLore,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchLore/comments/8gxm7o/what_do_you_think_the_writers_are_up_to_now/,"[You may remember that a couple of months ago, Blizzard was looking for a new writer to expand the universe](https://pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-lore). Given that Blizzard must be very well aware of the common complaint that the lore is interesting yet underutilized, and has hinted in the past that they'll expand on it, that begs the question: What do you think the writers are up to?

I'm not sure if they've hired the new writer yet, but I imagine they've must've gotten quite a large number of applicants. The fact they want an experienced and talented writer to join the team tells me they're getting serious about it, and all the droughts are build\-up to an explosion of lore awesomeness. The fact that the recent Retribution event was their most successful event of them all says a lot, even more than Junkenstein's Revenge. Before that, Uprising was voted the best of them all by a huge margin. It's clear to everyone: the audiences are starved for lore.

I wasn't sure if when a new writer joins if it would be announced or if it would be underwraps. But I'd say they wouldn't to draw too much attention to whatever big project they have planned in the future. My hope, that I've been speculating for a while based on hints, is that an animated Overwatch Netflix series is somewhere down the pipeline. It would just make perfect sense, Overwatch would translate perfectly into animation with its story and design, and Netflix wouldn't impose executive meddling like network TV does. Given that different Blizzard employees said an animated series would be perfect, there's a good chance we'll see it. But *when*? That's a good question.

Also, [they wanted an intern with extensive knowledge of Overwatch lore for an unnamed project, like a single\-player spin\-off](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/blizzard-wants-intern-for-new-project-with-knowledge-of-overwatch). That would work very well too. 

Honestly, since Overwatch is a billion dollar franchise, I'd expect Blizzard to pull out all the stops in cashing in on it from every possible angle. They've proven how much money they can make off of eSports, now they can prove how much *more* money they can make off general audiences. Everyone wins in that scenario.

What do you think?"
8gz7gs,1,2018-05-04,Ripple Effect: Chapter 2,quatrepeufemmes,stories,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/8gz7gs/ripple_effect_chapter_2/,"Chapter 2

This handsome young man was speaking to me.  I could see his lips moving, but  I couldn’t comprehend what he was saying. All I could do was stare at  him. I felt a connection. I knew him. I couldn’t understand any of this. Finally, I focused carefully to what he was saying. Are you alright, ma’m? I nodded my head but no words formed in my mouth. I didn’t understand why he was asking me if I was okay. Then I realized I was crying. The tears I had been holding back; I hadn’t been able to. They were flowing freely down my cheeks. I was certain that my mascara was leaving a messy trail along with them. The stranger had set across from me on the train. He looked relaxed and comfortable. I couldn’t explain it, but his presence made me feel at ease. Where had I seen him before today? How did I know this man? Surely, it was more than just an odd feeling. I was thinking so hard I didn’t realize he exited the train at the next stop. 

It struck me out of nowhere. The stranger felt familiar because he resembled Grace. That must be it! He had the same blonde hair and blue eyes. He must have been about her age. I thought for just a brief second about Charles. I am positive that is what he would have looked like. I quickly put that out of my mind. 

The train arrived at the World Trade Center Path Station. I still was in awe of this exceptionally crafted building each time I was there. I took a second to  call Joel to check on Grace. She had regained consciousness in the ambulance and the doctors were running tests. She had a laceration above her eye where she had hit the sink when she collapsed to the  ground. I made sure to explain the importance of having a plastic surgeon stitch her up. She was too young for such a nasty scar to remind her of whatever was going on during this eventful day. He promised to keep me informed. I boarded the train to Newark Penn Station. It was awfully crowded and I sat beside a man who was chatty. You could tell he was from the south by his accent; probably here on vacation or business. I still had a southern drawl myself. Maybe that’s why he felt like talking. Usually, I love to talk to strangers on the train. I love to learn their story, but today I was short. I felt overwhelmed with heartache and anxiety. So much was wrong, and I couldn’t do anything to help. Grace was sick. Margaret couldn’t have babies. Silas was gone. Charles was…. No! I reminded myself not to dwell. I turned to the man and began talking to him about Elizabeth. She was doing marvelous and that was what I would share with  the southern native. I told him my daughter was beginning her internship at Vanderbilt in Nashville. She was brilliant and beautiful. She could have been a model, standing at nearly 5’10”. She inherited her height and olive complexion from her father. Her auburn hair and freckles came from me. She wore her straight hair down her back and rarely wore any makeup. Even from an early age, she turned the heads of men everywhere. There was something so simple, yet mysterious about her. Nonetheless, she had never really given into dating. Her career was her life. She promised she intended to settle down one day. I had hoped that was true. Lizzie, she only let me call her that, was genuine and selfless. I couldn’t imagine her not sharing that with a family of her own. The sweet man listened to my story and I listened to him share about growing up in Kentucky. I was wrong about him being on vacation. He had moved here last year in hopes of starting a new life. I smiled because I had come here for the same reason. Of course, I didn’t share how my story ended with Silas’ death. 

We said our goodbyes and headed our separate ways inside the Newark Penn Station.  I opened the Uber app on my phone and arranged for a driver to take me to the airport. I made my way through the crowds toward the pickup location. I stopped to buy a bottle of water. That’s when I saw him again. The blonde boy. He was camouflaged in a sea of people, but he saw me too. He recognized me and I was surprised when he waved. I lifted my hand to return the gesture, but he was gone. I wasn’t sure why, but I felt terribly disappointed. 

I arrived to the airport with a few minutes to spare. I didn’t have any luggage to check, so I sat in the waiting area and dialed Margaret’s number. I thought it might go to voicemail since it was the middle of her school day. I imagined her sitting at a little table teaching kindergarteners new words. Her long, delicate fingers would be pointing out letters as her soft voice pronounced each syllable. She probably had on a classic dress and heels. I imagined her mane of auburn curls were pulled up at the nape of her neck. It didn’t matter that she worked with tiny humans, she still dressed like a young Jackie Kennedy. She had the brightest blue eyes, almost the color of cobalt; and her fair skin was flawless. Her husband was wealthy and she didn’t have to work, but it was her love of children that motivated her to keep her job. She had been named teacher of the year twice at her school and once in the Fulton County. Multiple parents requested her as their child’s teacher each year, as her reputation preceded her. Jake, my son in law, was born into southern money. He also had a lucrative job as publicist for the Atlanta Braves. They had a beautiful home, a villa at St. Simon’s, traveled the world. He gave my daughter anything she ever wanted, except the one thing she wanted most. A baby. I had encouraged adoption, but both spouses were adamant that they give every effort to having a biological child. I was surprised when Margaret answered on the second ring. 

“Mom, are I you on your way home?” She seemed desperate. I assured her I was waiting to board my plane and would be in Savannah in less than two hours. She was in the car driving from Atlanta. She knew I hated when the girls would use their phone while driving, so we kept the conversation short and sweet. I told her I loved her and would see her soon. She was almost in Macon, so we should be at St. Joseph’s around the same time. I hated going home for this reason, but there was excitement in my stomach to be seeing two of my children today. 

   I rolled my small suitcase onto the plane before I placed in the storage area above my first class seat. All the seats were empty and I was anxious about who would fill those places in a few minutes. Although my body was consumed with fear and worry, I planned to rest on the flight. I knew I would need all the energy I could muster once I arrived in Savannah. I got comfortable in my window seat and put my earbuds in. I was staring out the window when I felt someone sit next to me. I pretended to ignore them and pulled a book out of my purse. I had no intentions of actually reading, but it was a great decoy of distraction. The stranger next to me had other ideas about how this plane ride would unfold. I felt the gentle touch of a large hand on my shoulder. It should have startled me, even angered me; but I felt comforted. I turned to look at the owner of this perplexing gesture. I saw his hair first and knew it was him. The man from the street. And, then the subway. You! I uttered the words before I could consider how rude I must sound. He smiled, not offended at all. He introduced himself as Nathan. He didn’t look like a Nathan. He commented how ironic it was that we had run into each other twice in one day. Actually, it was three times; but I didn’t want to seem like a stalker. He mentioned seeing my tears earlier and I explained the situation with Grace. He accepted the story I provided and didn’t invade my privacy. The conversation ended and I felt the desire to continue talking. He looked so much like what I imagined Charles would look like as a man. I still missed him every single day. I could still feel him in my arms. I remember the morning of the accident. He woke up early and found me in the kitchen. I was packing food for the trip and I stopped to pour him a sippy cup of milk. His blonde hair was tousled and his huge blue eyes followed my every step. He was wearing footed pajamas displaying different forms of transportation. He loved to point out each one and make the accompanying sound. Whooosh.  Wooooshhh. Those were the words that always described the helicopter. This had become a routine at bedtime that he looked forward to. There was just something about babies in footed pajamas that made me want to cuddle. I scooped him in my arms and off to the antique rocking chair we went. I vividly remembered his smell that morning. It was a mixture of baby shampoo and Dreft laundry detergent. I inhaled and tried to capture the sense, but all I could manage was the scent of coffee. I opened my eyes and remembered I was on the plane to Savannah. The man next to me was watching me. It felt like I was in my memories for a while, but I realize it has only been a few seconds. Thinking about your daughter? I didn’t feel like revealing too much, so I nodded. I turned back toward the window where I had a beautiful view of the sun shining through the cumulus clouds.  I resented the fact that I only had Charles for three years. I wanted to rock him again in my great grandmother’s rocking chair. It’s amazing how the mind works. It had been over 15 years since the accident and I still craved the feel of his small hand in mine. This man sitting beside me reminded me of how much I missed my son. I blurted it out before I could help myself. You remind me of my son. He died. He said nothing in return, only lowered his head and fixed his gaze on the floor in front of him. Oh, great! First, I was crying on the subway. Now, I’m talking irrationally. He probably thinks I am crazy. I opened my book back up to a random page and decided that the conversation was over. He interrupted my pretend reading. So, your daughter is sick? I went into more detail about what had happened earlier this morning to Grace. I rambled on about her entire life story, actually. He smiled and seemed genuinely interested. In the midst of my many stories, he asked the most bizarre question. She’s a twin, isn’t she? How could he have possibly known that? After the accident, Grace suffered horribly. She would wake in the middle of the night screaming for Charles. I was grieving and in my own personal hell. I secretly resented the times I would be forced out of my own pity to comfort my child. But, I had no choice. She was a baby, just three years old. And her twin, the person she shared the womb with, had been suddenly ripped from her life. She didn’t understand and she only wanted me. Joel seemed to be enough for the older girls. After the first year, Grace stopped talking about her brother. And, she never referred to herself as a twin. After a while, I stopped too. So, how did this man know such an intimate fact? "

8gzt06,1694,2018-05-04,I started crying when I read the employee benefits,jajunebug,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8gzt06/i_started_crying_when_i_read_the_employee_benefits/,"I just got an internship for a big tech company, and today I started crying while reading the employee benefits handout.

I always considered myself average.  Strictly average.  I never saw myself achieving anything big.  I figured big opportunities were for smart people, for hard-working people, for people who deserved it.  And I never saw myself as any of those.  I only saw myself scraping by college, taking what I could get.  Hoping that I didn't fall behind and disappoint my parents.

But now, I got this internship.  During the whole process, I was waiting for them to drop me.  I completed multiple interviews, each time thinking about how badly it went, and would just think, ""Oh well. It's not like I deserve this internship anyway.""

Even when I got the congratulations letter, I told myself it was because I'm a female in a tech field, not because I actually deserve it.  I told myself I was accepted as a claim to diversity, and that being happy over the internship would show that I'm too proud of skills that I don't have.

I continually put myself down, but for some reason, reading the employee benefits made it feel so real.  I realized that all the cool benefits that the ""super smart"" people at these big tech companies get were not some sort of unreachable level of life that I was destined to stay apart from since the day I was born.  I'm there.  I can be one of those people.

I've worked nonstop since I got to college and it really feels like it's paying off.  I feel like I'm breaking a barrier that seemed invincible.  I'm so thankful for this opportunity and I can barely believe it's my life.  But I won't tell myself that I'm achieving this out of diversity.  I'm not achieving this out of pity.  I worked for this.  And it feels so good to have hard work show results."

8h09tm,2,2018-05-04,[HELP] Negotiating a Job in Honduras,jewoods,Honduras,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honduras/comments/8h09tm/help_negotiating_a_job_in_honduras/,"[UPDATE May 7, 2018]: For those interested there was very limited negotiation room, but I did get the job offer for $10,000 annually (about $830/month or HNL 19,700/month).  Thanks for all your help!  See you in May!

For those not interested in the background but interested in helping my question is this:

1. **How much** should an young man with a Bachelors degree ask for **to live comfortably in Danli**? **How much** should I estimate **in transport** if I frequently travel to/from small pueblos and aldeas in between Tegus and Danli? (per month in USD or HNL)
2. **How much would you expect to make as a head of a small NGO** that is based in the US but operating in Honduras to make per year living in a very small aldea on the road between Tegus and Danli? (I'm trying to estimate how much he would make *so as to not ask for more than what my boss makes*)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I found a job posting for an NGO operating in the Department of El Paraiso and I need to estimate how much salary to ask for or at least how much would be livable.  The job posting was originally for an ""internship"" and not a job for $500 a month.  I really like the organization so I tried to see if a full time position was available and they said they will be able to make it work.  They said they'd be calling me this afternoon with all the exact details (salary, location, job description, etc...) but I realized I have no idea what to negotiate the salary for.  Although I lived in Honduras, I was there as a missionary and my financial needs were generally taken care of.  I would like to have a livable wage where I can save a decent amount (preferably 2000 HNL a month) and not feel like I have to save every cent.  I was estimating needing about 14000 HNL a month to live comfortably, with an idea of around 17000 HNL if I want to make it a little more comfortable.  I understand the cost of living is much lower, but I would like to negotiate for a salary as high as possible to try and save while I'm there rather than just getting by.  I also don't want to ask for more than what my boss is making since I will be working as his assistant. 

I probably should have posted this a few days ago to give more time for responses, but I wasn't thinking.

8h0c4t,6,2018-05-04,I’m not sure how to get over you,phytoframpton,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8h0c4t/im_not_sure_how_to_get_over_you/,"We met on Reddit. We were just supposed to be friends. We aided each other through the most terrible of times. But then, we fell in love. 

We grew fonder and fonder of each other. Over the past few months, we already knew we wanted to get married. I had already picked a spot to propose at as well. 

I was going to move to your state since we were in a LDR. But that day you said you cheated on me, it all changed. I had told you there were two things I couldn’t do: dishonesty and infidelity. We could work through just about anything else.

When you lied to me about kissing that guy at first, I thought my insecurities from a past relationship were flaring up . You admitted sleeping with him a week afterwards. it broke me. I’m still piecing myself together after the grief. 

We were supposed to spend our days together. I was supposed to kiss you all over during the mornings like I always did. You would grapple me closer so we could never leave the safety and warmth of those crimson sheets. I couldn’t imagine a world sweeter than that. 

You may have apologized. You may have told me what you did was rancid. But I almost forgot all of that Just so I could text you good morning today. 

I wish I could tell you how well my internship is going. I wish I could plan a flight to see you this very day. I wish you send me those wonderful pictures you send of you and our little fish.

It took me four hours to get out of bed today, and all I wanted to do is call you. All I want to do is make sure you’ve got nothing but a smile on that face. But, I can’t. I think that’s what hurts the most. "

This is a story how freelancing/working online for someone can fuck you up. Even if the person is a millionare and your ""friend"".

First of all, something about me. I'm a poor ass student who's in a poor ass country trying to work my way up in programming (C#, .NET). In order to be successful at this, as everything else in life, it requires a lot of cash to earn the knowledge and certificates which companies in my country find mandatory. I've been trying to find a job (anything) for the last 12 months,but everyone that's hiring either hires friends or interns (government pays about half paycheck for interns). Luckily, I knew a guy (who I considered a friend), the same person who scammed me, who after all failed attempts offered me a job to freelance for him (work on the website as ""analyst/tester"" and work on filling up the inventory with Excel. I accepted the job and did my absolute best to learn everything in which he generously aided me. It took me a couple of days to figure how everything about website csv inventory worked before I was assigned projects to complete. Once again, I did my absolute best in period of two weeks to complete all projects on time. I hadn't slept one period for a couple of days as I was rushing to help him release his website earlier than scheduled. Besides all other website testing and tips to improve it I gave him, the initial projects were about filling up the website inventory. This was done through a complicated and mind-fucking document sheets (Excel) where I was promised 0.10$ per line. I finished several documents of 27k lines (Means he had 27k items ready to be added to website) . This equals to a bit more than 2700 USD. Everything went smooth, he loved the work and which you'll see in screenshots, said everything was fine. Immediately me offered another document that's double the lines (this would mean another ~5000 USD) but I insisted that we settled the payment first. He suggested Paypal. After several weeks of reading his excuses (such as, his wife forgot to plug in the power in his office, his accountant does it on specific days of the month, ""he forgot me"", his Paypal is broken...and so on and on...) it came to a point where he ran out of excuses, so he's simply ignoring my messages. I haven't slept properly for a week now knowing my future changed in a blink. Anyways, to cut the story short, below are some vital screenshots of our conversation. There is a lot more to it but I'll let you judge on this. He said he usually hires freelancers so for your own sake, avoid this guy and his ads.

8h18c7,32,2018-05-04,I (24F) am at the end of my rope regarding people who won't call me by my preferred name.,prettyappleingreen,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8h18c7/i_24f_am_at_the_end_of_my_rope_regarding_people/,"I want to start off by saying that it is very rare for me to be this bothered by this type of annoying habit. I'm usually very much the ""let it roll off"" kind of person, and I can't tell if I'm justified in this case, but I feel like it's worth making that disclaimer so you know I don't just run around finding problems with everyone. This just seems like SUCH an intentionally rude, callous thing to do to someone, and I don't think I'd ever do it to anyone, but maybe that really is just me. Please let me know and feel free to be harsh if you think it's necessary.

Basically, there are a lot of people in my life who have decided that they have no responsibility to use the nickname I much prefer. This is more reasonable in some circumstances than others, but what bother me are the ones where it's really not. I put this as a personal issue because I'm super interested in a script or a way of dealing with these people. I've tried everything I can think of and nothing works.

Here's the issue. I have a short, old-fashioned name. For the purpose of this post, I'll pretend it's ""Maud."" (It's not.) I've always disliked this name, and I've always had to explain it and spell it at Starbuckseseses/to new people. It also doesn't help that, together with my last name, I sound extremely Jewish on paper - think ""Maud Goldstein"" - and I am not a practicing Jew (my dad is Jewish and it's his last name). It's not an issue in and of itself to be identified as Jewish, but it's really not who I am, and that adds another layer of explanation.

Since the seventh grade, I've chosen instead to go by ""Maudie."" (Again, keep in mind this isn't my real name, but my real one is just as short, and I nickname it with an -ie.) I find this version to be softer and more ambiguous, and I like it much better.

When you change your name in seventh grade, even slightly, nobody gives a shit. I have friends who I've known from age 6 who still call me Maud, and refuse to change. Obviously I kind of get that, but it's been more than a decade, and they STILL won't call me Maudie. I have had explicit, serious conversations with each of them where I truly lay out how much this bothers me and how much I would prefer to be called Maudie. They don't. I'm not going to pretend that that doesn't hugely bother me, because it really makes me angry. It takes no effort and means a huge amount to me, and they just refuse. For the most part, these are high-school people I've drifted from anyway, though, so I've let that go.

The point of that paragraph is that, from seventh grade on, I have gone by Maudie exclusively. Once I hit college I'd use Maud for professional purposes, but those were only ever internships, and I never interned at the same place as any of my friends. There is literally nobody I have met in a social setting since I was 13 who should be calling me Maud at this point.

Despite all of that, my three best college girlfriends - who I met in college, and separate from those abovementioned elementary/high-school people - have abruptly started to call me Maud. I don't get it, I don't like it, and I've made both of those things clear. They still do it. Again, I want to reiterate that it is unusual for me to be this babyish about a nickname, and I hate that I care so much, but I really, really do. However, at this point in my life (out of college) I'm working a job anyway where some people call me either nickname, so not everyone in my life is someone I just know socially anymore. It still really bothers me that apparently my friends have arbitrarily decided to stick to something they know I hate - for the second time in my life -but I have decided not to rock the boat re: Maude and Maudie with those friends since I'm currently getting called both anyway.

I will say once more for grand, dramatic emphasis that I simply do not understand how people are so callous as to decide that they get to change my name because they like it. It is truly something I would never do to someone. I am not transgender and I do not claim to have gone through what trans people have gone through, but it really feels to me like a watered-down version of someone refusing to use a trans person's new name, especially because I have been incredibly consistent with this name for A DECADE and these girls have started to use a name I NEVER went by when they knew me. But, again, I am trying hard not to be a ridiculous baby.

The real issue is here. All of this came to a head last weekend. I went to visit one of those three college friends, and she took me to a get-together with some friend of a friend. At the party, I was chatting with a guy who was trying to flirt a little; I was uninterested, but happy to keep talking in a friendly/distant way, until he asked whether Maudie was my full name. I told him that it was what I preferred, but my name was actually Maud, and I briefly described what I said above, basically just that I don't love Maud and think Maudie fits me better. He responded, ""I'm going to call you Maud. I like it better.""

I am not proud of this, and I was admittedly tipsy (although far from drunk), but I reacted really strongly. I said - I think pretty much verbatim -- ""it genuinely surprises me that you're so presumptuous that you think it's okay and maybe even welcome to inform me that you'll be calling me by a name I just told you I disliked."" He was kind of floored. 

I didn't tell anyone about this, but he apparently told the friend I was visiting, because she texted me asking what fight I had had with him. She was, rightly, surprised that I had started some spat, because again that is just so incredibly not my style. I told her in brief/objectively what had happened, and she asked me if it was really so big of a deal. I honestly didn't know what to say at that point, so I called her, because text can come off passive-aggressive/angry and I didn't want to take that chance here, but I basically told her that yes, it was, to me; that I knew she used ""Maud,"" but I'd been asking her not to since she started, and had never used it for myself in front of her; and that I didn't really know what to say at this point, because she and other friends had made it clear they wouldn't respect my preferences.

She apologized and I told her it was okay, because I'm truly not angry anymore at her - I got over her part in this awhile a

go - but I guess that's where I'm left. I just don't know what to do. Maybe I shouldn't mind, but I DO mind. I just don't feel that it's anything near a lot to ask that people call me by the name I prefer. Again, maybe when you've known me since age 6 it's different (although I'll say that my family has had 0 problem with it), but I just do not understand what I can say to prevent or control people who have only ever known me by Maudie from using Maud instead.

If anyone has ever dealt with something similar, I'd be really grateful to hear some advice.

*TL;DR*: I don't know how to get across how serious I am about the use of a nickname I prefer."

That means we aren't doing our jobs. (Cue the Bernie Bros ""Man the Phone Banks!"")

I asked her why the House has decided to cede their oversight authority back to the Justice Dept. She had no answer for me. I asked if this is a Paul Ryan issue. She said she did not think so. She said the Judiciary Committee Chair has been working on this and I told her I was aware of that but that he seemed to have no backup and I wanted him to know he has backup. She said she knows of no specific legislation that has started regarding this and I reminded her they do not NEED legislation to provide their Article I oversight of the Justice Dept. I reminded her that no one in America has ever voted for Rod Rosenstein and I don't know where he gets off thinking he answers to no one but that's not how America works and she was all kinds of excited that I called because she told me that MY PHONE CALL would start the conversation with the big thinkers in the office of how to handle this and how to proceed.

I am a high school student going into computer science at university this next fall.

I started working at a programming company as a Quality Assurance intern(Testing their product) about 2 years ago. 

I feel I have done a decent job, however I have no received a raise.

As a paid intern, I never really expected to get a pay increase. I am grateful I was able to achieve a job in the field I want to go into in the future early, but I don't want to ruin any future opportunity.

However at the same time, I would like to save up more money before I go to college."
8h36nk,2,2018-05-04,Help me figure out my next life steps with my boyfriend!! (and still please my parents..),roaming-,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/8h36nk/help_me_figure_out_my_next_life_steps_with_my/,"Me (22F) and my boyfriend (23M) have been dating for about a year and a few months now and are head over heels for each other. We met at college during his senior year and when he graduated we decided to keep the relationship going because we knew it was right and we had to be together. Despite living very far away from each other while i finish school (him in Colorado and me in NY), over the course of the last year we've managed to spend about half of our time together and it's been great.

After a lot of talks we decided we are fully committed and ready to find any way to end the distance. I am about to go into another year of university in the fall and this summer I want to find an internship in his city and live with him and then he will come to spend the year with me in the city where I go to school. I spent a lot of time there with him last summer as well as him coming to visit me, and with him having a full time job there it makes more sense for me to come there for the summer. I've looked for jobs and have some options and I would be living in a very stable and rent free situation so I am not worried too much about logistics but where the problem comes in is my family.

My parents are really great and allow me to live pretty much as an independent adult, but due to some recent mental health issues (resurfacing from earlier in life, which i've proactively and properly dealt with) they seem to be a bit hesitant with these plans we've created. They like my boyfriend a lot but would rather me stay home but I think they might just be having a hard time accepting that I've found the person I want to be with and want to start building my life with him. I know I'm young but they raised me to be really mature and I've presented everything in a very responsible and proactive way. This was not an impulse decision but a pretty well thought out plan. I also haven't lived with my parents in their home for longer than school breaks since I graduated high school as i've always had internships in other cities (but not across the country, always within 1-2 hours driving distance). My parents also met when they were very young and went through this same type of situation and have been happily married now for over 25 years so I know they believe in love at a young age.

So what I'm not really sure about is the true reason they don't want me to leave. I have a feeling it may be simply because they miss me and don't want me to be growing up and leaving already, but it is just for a summer and it really is what I think it's best for myself and my relationship. If this is the reason why won't they just say that out loud rather than giving me more superficial reasons that i've had good responses to? 

I just know what I want for me at this point and want to know if any other young women or Moms have advice on how to handle this situation or if there might be things I'm not considering enough."

So, I'm going to be living 3 hours away from my parents for the summer, which really pissed them off when I told them. I told them that my plan was to get a job and work full time for the summer. Since I'm not leaving my university's town, it was pretty easy finding a job since I'd be able to continue working during the school year. My plan all along was to get a full time job or work 2 jobs if need be, and I definitely told my parents that. About a week ago my mom called me saying that if I didn't get an internship, then I ""had to come home."" Of course I replied no, since that wasn't my plan, and while I wasn't able to get an internship I was applying for jobs away from home. 

Today, she texted me saying that she got an email about my financial aid and needed to call me about it. I called her, and she was lecturing me about how it's soooooo important that I get this stuff figured out even though I told her I had already called and emailed the financial aid office. She asked if I would like for her to call them for me, and of course I replied no, since I already was taking care of it. She kept saying that I should let her call them so finally I said that if she wants to call them, then go ahead (she doesn't have my student ID # so she can't get very far with that).

Then, we began talking about the move out plan for this weekend, since I have to be out of my dorm by Sunday. I told her my grandparents (her parents) offered to come up and help take my stuff back, and she got super pissed saying that she had planned on coming up or some shit, even though she had texted me saying that she wasn't going to come up this weekend. She yelled at me for making my grandparents help me (I didn't ask, they offered) since my grandpa has a bad back (which is why my sister and friend are helping me). I didn't tell her I got a job, but my grandparents told her, and she told me that if she had known I got a full time job for the summer she would have been fine with me staying at College Town all along (lie #1). When I told her that she told me the last time we spoke that she was only okay with me staying at College Town if I had an internship, she denied it and said I was making up things to make her look bad and me look good (lie #2). I had made a joke when I was talking about my grandparents coming up, which she took out of context and told me that I was rubbing it in her face that I got the grandparents to help me and that I don't need her anymore. I told her that I didn't need her, and she said ""fine jessicaat123, I guess you can figure out your own fucking FAFSA stuff"" and hung up on me.

Hahaha, I still think it's funny that she basically forced me to give her ""permission"" to call my school's financial aid department and then tried to use it to make me think I needed her help with it. I'm so glad I'll be rid of her, at least for a few months. I do have to stop by her house to get my stuff, so wish me luck!"

I do drive a little, but all the roads where I live are very familiar to me and I never have a need to drive more than 10 minutes away from home. 

In less than a month, I'm going to Dallas, Texas for an internship, and I'll also have to drive from Dallas to Houston (about a 3.5 hour drive). I just read a thread on the Houston subreddit, about how crazy Houston drivers are, and how many crashes there are on the highway every day. I'm afraid about driving alone, figuring out new roads (to and from the workplace/the apartment, to the supermarket, etc.) and also the drive from Dallas to Houston. 

I'm not a confident person, so I don't think I'll know how to handle being on crazy highways and dealing with situations that even experienced drivers get frazzled by. I just don't want to get in a crash and hurt someone or myself, especially since Texas is really far from my home.

8h42e3,1,2018-05-04,What does it mean when a friend keeps distance from you?,forget4,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/8h42e3/what_does_it_mean_when_a_friend_keeps_distance/,"Im a 23 year odl guy that has a lot of friends, both guys and girls, but sometimes I meet girls that are really friendly with me and then sort of distance themselves. For example, I interned with a girl that was pretty cool, she had a boyfriend, we would always talk and make jokes with each other, all that. She and I tried to get some of the other interns to come hang out with us after the internship ended and one other girl showed up. After that we headed home and that first girl mentioned we should hang out on campus when the semester starts since we go to the same school. Once the semester started I tried reaching out to her so we could hang out but she seemed more off, and there was always something going on.

I saw her a few times too on campus and Id say hi to her and she would say hi back but keep it moving. If I didnt say anything she wouldnt say anything back. I never flirted with her or anything and she even knew I was looking to date because I did ask her if she had any single friends. But that was after we had already became good friends. I may even see her tomorrow at a social event but Im kind of worried about saying hi because I feel like she doesnt want to acknowledge me.

Another girl I met through friends was also pretty cool, she invited me to hang out with our friends and I did as well but something usually came up for us so we didnt get to see each other a lot. At school I usually ahd to be the one to say hi or else she wouldnt so eventually I kind of stopped because it felt like the other girl. I was at a social event a few months ago and she didnt acknowledge me at all. I didnt say anything either but when I posted an instagram picture she liked it. She never really liked any of my pcitures except for the first one I posted months back when I first adxed her. A few months later I ended up going to an appointment and turns out she works at that place and she was very friendly and talkative with me.

I have many other instances of this as well. I have a few other girls that I interned with on social media and they were really nice and friendly to me during that time. One even wanted to set me up with her friend randomly after she heard I was single but that fell through. Anyways, when I try talking to them to catch up or say hi or anything they dont seem too interested in talking. Im not really sure what to think about these kinds of things.

I think I am very friendly, I definitely dont flirt with these girls and I set more boundaries when I am around them when I find out they have boyfriends or something. Like I avoid hugging them unless they initiate it and refrain from any kind of compliments or touching. I have very good friends who are girls that know me way more personally that seem to really like hanging out with me and go out of their way to do so. But when it comes to establishing friendships with most girls they seem really friendly and into having me around as a friend but then eventually just bring it down to the point as if the friendship fades even if I try keeping it going. What does that say about me or am I doing anything wrong? 

Tldr; I think I am a friendly guy, I make friends with people and sometimes girls seem very happy with having me around as a friend. But eventually they kind of fade into less talking and not wanting to hang out for some reason. I dont flirt with them, I avoid any kind of touching unless they initiate it, if they have boyfriends I make sure to keep it in mind so I dont give off any weird vibes, I also ask about their boyfriends so that I can get to know them more and show that Im not interested in them. I even mention my own dating life if it comes up. Does that just mean they dont want to be friends anymore or could I be doing something to cause this because not every girl does this and those that dont are much closer to me and I behave the same way around them."

I have done retail, restaurant, hotel, event and even police work, working towards and gaining my bachelor's in Hospitality Management. I've tried working towards goals but soon learned those goals were not what I wanted to truly work towards. I've done a lot of traveling but I felt like a lot of that stemmed from not wanting to be where I was.

I have been out of work for almost a month and besides a trip to Denver, I have been stuck in my household because of lack of money and for the first time not having anything to work towards since I always had school or an internship. I feel so ashamed and besides myself. I need the money but more importantly, I need the freedom that comes with having the job which is weird to say but I wanna work instead of staying home all day and binging Netflix. Even worse when I live in one of the biggest cities in the US (NYC born and raised) and I feel like nothing is here for me.

TL,DR: Being real personal to strangers is hard. Struggling to find job, never had extended period of time of inactivity but have no clear goal set either and feel like crap. What can I do to ease my struggles or should I settle for less if I feel this way?"

I apologize for the incoming wall of text. Thowaway account because my hubby is a redditor. TLDR at the bottom.


My husband and I have been married 3 years, together 8. We met in college. He was smart and ambitious, which is why I found him so attractive. He was mildly overweight, but i never minded. I'm naturally thin (but a lazybones) so fitness isn't a huge priority to me, but I do want a relatively healthy partner. Our relationship went along well for the first 2 years or so.


However, we both have history of mental health problems (I have depression/panic disorder, he has depression/ADHD). Over the course of 5 years of dating, we both had issues arise from our disorders. However we were always able to bounce back. His depression got worse...I stood by him through a hospitalization for a suicide attempt. During the time leading up to his attempt, he bounced from job to job while I was still in my last year of undergrad. He was unemployed for nearly a year before and during his recovery. Because we lived together I maxed out on student loans to support us (I also continued this through graduate school to support us...I am now over $90,000 in debt compared to his $25,000).


Things got better for about a year and a half afterwards. He was gainfully employed and the future seemed bright. We got engaged for a year, and were married about 6 months before his depression acted up again. He was fired from his job due to poor performance from taking unpaid sick days. I shouldered the financial burden again. We barely made it through my last 2 years of graduate school with my growing loans and meager internship pay. 


Now don't forget, I suffer from depression too. I feel like my own mental health has taken a backseat to his. I pay all bills, do the majority of the chores, plan visits with family, etc. He does contribute by cooking dinner each night and occasional cleanups. He is getting better about helping, but it feels largely uneven. He mostly sits at his computer all day, on Reddit or playing games with friends. He does job applications in inconsistent bursts but because his employment gap is so large, I worry he won't find anything. He refuses to do retail or food service because he gained weight (at least 50 pounds if not more) and it hurts him to be active for long periods. Personally, I think an active job would be good for him. Our sex life has declined. I'm not as physically attracted to him and the ambition I was so attracted to seems long gone. I have tried so hard to support him. But I'm hurting. 


What else can I reasonably do? We only have one car, I'm at work all day, and have panic attacks frequently. I'm so sad; I feel like I can't breathe. I would love to get him back on his meds, but it's too expensive to put him on my insurance. I also looked into counseling, but my insurance only covers individual therapy. I know each day that goes by he feels worse. I feel like I've just failed as a wife or something. Is he content with this situation? He says he is trying, but I'm not so sure anymore. I put on a brave face around friends and family who continually give me the side eye about how he isn't ""supporting me."" They're right, but I don't want to divorce. I want my husband back. But how do I know when I've given enough? I wanted so much more for us. Did I make a mistake? There were obviously red flags but it's not as though I am without flaws. I knew I was marrying a man with mental health struggles, but I didn't think we would end up in our current situation. I want to have savings. I want to vacation. I want us to be able to buy a home one day. I worry my empathy is fading, and I feel so burnt out.


TLDR: My husband has gained more than 50 pounds through the course of our marriage and sex has declined due to a lack of attraction and physical constraints. I have a lot of built up resentment due to his unemployment for the past 2 years (plus an additional year from when we were dating prior to engagement). He doesn't help much with chores or emotional labor, and cites his ADHD and depression as the cause. Have I crossed over from supportive wife into enabler/codependent territory? How do we move forward from this and fix our marriage?"

It's because they, someone from a lower class family, went ahead and signed up for a $30,000/year private school because their teachers told them for the last 10 years that the more ""prestige"" the school had, the better off you'd be.

**DON'T FALL FOR THE PEER PRESSURE OR FROM THE POOR ADVICE OF OUT-OF-TOUCH TEACHERS OR IGNORANT-BUT-WELL-MEANING PARENTS**

I'm sick of seeing kids ruin their lives with a house's worth of student loan debt. Please listen to someone who grew up dirt poor and is will be a multi millionare by retirement:

1. LIVE WITHIN YOUR MEANS. A college degree does not mean a job. A college degree does not mean a good paying job. A college degree is a piece of paper that tells a potential employee that you have received basic training for the role they're trying to fill. It's an investment of several thousand dollars and YEARS of your life. If you're just looking to have fun away from your parents, you can just get a VISA to Costa Rica for a few years for much cheaper. It's not a summer camp, it's a financial investment. Much like any other investment, you need to evaluate the best strategy to tackle it. 

2. If you're poor, don't listen to your teachers, and respectfully evaluate the advice of your parents. When I was growing up, my teachers would tell me that anyone without a college degree would be stuck flipping burgers for minimum wage. My parents wanted to me to get ANY college degree because they didn't know any better. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM.

The purpose of a college degree is financial. It is to get you a career. It's a piece of paper that gets you ahead of the guys that don't have a piece of paper declaring they have a basic understanding of the subject-matter. If you're going to college for anything except a career and you're not some trust fund baby, then you should not go to college. 

There are three things you need to check before you even sign up for college:
i. Is this degree useful? If it's underwater feminist stealth knitting, drop out now.

ii. Am I likely to get a starting job with this degree? Not Ll degrees are made equally, but they will all cost you the same amount of investment! If youre a mediocre student pursuing a degree that's very competitive, stop while you're ahead.

iii. Am I willing to put in the effort to master my craft? If you hate it, drop it.

There is nothing wrong with not having a degree. There's two factors that matter in life when it comes to financial success: motivation and smarts. If you're a motivated guy with no degree, you're going to do better than a lazy Hispanic Studies major with 300k in student loan debt. College is NOT for everyone and it doesn't have to be for you.

The point of a college degree, again, is to get your foot in the door of a career. For the most part, an employer is looking to hire a college graduate for one reason: budget. They're on a low budget and can't afford a seasoned professional, so they have to find a fresh face to train. 

If you have a useful college degree, then most employers will not care where you graduated from. They'll look at the following, in this order: 1) experience (internships) 2) GPA 3) college. If you've got two internships at TechCompany123 and graduated from a public university, you're in a bracket above a Harvard graduate with 0 internships.

After around 5 years of experience, practically no employer will care what school you graduated from nor your GPA, they'll care about your experience. The prestige of the school will matter as much as the fact that you can also speak Spanish: it'll shoot you across the finish line if they've got an identical candidate, but it's mostly a useful fact.

With that in mind: if you're poor, then you have a few options: work, scholarships, community college, and college credit courses in high school. Combine those to get you the best investment you can find. Get into the college that's willing to pay you the most, do the general electives with a cheap community college, and shave some of those with AP credits while working to pay for th rest. Don't be an idiot and go to a school that'll give you nothing because of the ""prestige.""

You will not become successful overnight. It requires patience, and a lot of wisdom. Don't waste your money, and don't waste your time. Above all: have the wisdom to understand where you stand. Don't assume that you're going to be successful therefore you can afford to take $XXXXX in loans. Realize you're poor, and spend within your means. You will work very hard and enjoy the fruits of your labor.

Pick up a Bible and read Proverbs, kids. "
8h4w8i,15,2018-05-04,Ranking S10 Lip Syncs,Keifer430,rupaulsdragrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/8h4w8i/ranking_s10_lip_syncs/,"Since we are at the halfway point of the season I wanted to see how you rank the first seven lip syncs of the season.


Since the queens are all bottoms I shall start at the bottom too. 


7: Eureka vs Kalorie:  I was excited to see Eureka lip sync and I was not impressed. Part of it was the song, but nothing about it was gag worthy. 

6: Mayhem vs Monét:  It had some entertainment, but it had sloppy moments from Monét’s delayed ruveals to Mayhem’s bronze medal cartwheel. Also the part where Mayhem skips around and the long motorcycle ride was eh. A good song but not executed moves. I did like the small interaction they had in the end. 

5: Vanessa vs Kalorie: For a first lip synch if was entertaining. Kalorie’s making it rain moment was nice and Vanessa’s shoe flying across the stage was enjoyable. 

4: Blair vs Vixen: Both did great and I loved the Vixen’s dance break number with the trumpet and Blair was stunning. 

3: Monique vs Vixen: Why is this higher than others after how sloppy it was?  That’s the reason why!  Personally I enjoyed the performance even it has those moments. Monique was just having bad moments but she gave it her all. The moves she had were perfect for the song (minus her failed attempt to do gymnastics) if she didnt have the wig and word problem. The Vixen killed it from her twirls, flips, and barrel rolls. 

2: Yuhua vs Mayhem:  The rock vibes I really loved and it was another lip sync where both girls did great. Usually the first couple of lip syncs are floppy with both girls doing meh or one girls is lip syncing with the intern backup dancer, but that was different. This is also a song I wasn’t fond of, but their performance made me like it. 

1: Monét vs Dusty:  The song, the moves, the effects, &amp; Ru’s botched face made this wonderful. We also got the fake death drop which was AMAZING. I really like Dusty’s interpretation of the song, but everything Monét did I fell in love. 


Ok that’s my take on it. I’m ready for the comments. "
8h5148,1,2018-05-04,My life has hit rock bottom this week and I don't know what to feel anymore,Endofafamily,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8h5148/my_life_has_hit_rock_bottom_this_week_and_i_dont/,"Tl;dr - Dad cheated on my mom of 30 ish years and he doesn't know that I know. I can't find a job in my field to save my life. Girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me. I don't know if I can handle all of this. 

So where to start... I recently graduated from my engineering college after long and grueling 6 years. I had several summer jobs and internship, yet I can't seem to get even a call back. I must've submitted 20-30 resumes in the past 4 months but all I get is silence.

This wouldn't be a huge problem for many recent graduates but my personal and family life is crumbling down. The biggest heartbreak came from my now ex-girlfriend. She graduated a semester earlier and had been travelling Europe for the past two months. During this time, our communication was... Less than perfect. I was finishing up my final project and applying for jobs during her trip. When she came back, it was as if we were complete strangers. She sat me down the morning after she came back and ended things, saying the dreaded ""I love you but I'm not in love with you.""

Since we still lived together, I drove to my parents' place to clear my head and mourn. Just today I picked up my sister from her university where she told me about what my dad has been up to. Turns out he's started to cheat on my mother, whom he's been married to for about 30 years. He operates a gas station in a small town and he'd been making frequent trips to another city to ""find a better business"". We're first generation immigrants and while my mom was visiting the home country for a month, dad had started a fling with another woman in this city. My sister had suspicions about dad's behaviour and decided to snoop his phone; where she found messages between my dad and his mistress. It seemed like he had met her family and almost started another family with her. He, of course, doesn't know that we know. We haven't told our mom either per my sister's conversation with a lawyer. He advised that we gather more evidence and give some time so my mom wouldn't forgive my dad so easily. 

The thing that makes this more complicated is the fact that my mom can't speak English and doesn't really have any money. My dad had several failed businesses before this and, as most Asian couple are, pretty controlling of the finances. My mom doesn't have any money saved, I don't have a place to live after June, and my sister is still in school. If something were to happen, my mom would be bascially homeless and neither of us would be able to support her. 

It feels like my life had come crumbling down this past week. I'm just so tired, angry, sad, numb... I don't know. I feel sick just knowing my dad (I don't think I can even call him that anymore) can do this to our family. After all the bullshit he fucking put us through. I wanna bash his fucking head against a wall for being so fucking selfish. My mom whose been through hell and back to raise two kids in a country where she doesn't speak the language. My mom who lives for her husband and her kids. My mom who had to sacrifice so much for her family. And that piece of fuck can't even keep his dick in his pants.

I'm... Just done. I don't know what to feel anymore. I feel hopeless and all I wanna do is drink, cry, and sleep. I'm honestly not looking for sympathy; I just needed to vent about this to people who doesn't know me. Thank you for reading if you read this far....hope your week is going hell a lot better than mine. "

I live in Orlando so if I got a summer internship there I'd be able to go solo a lot. I figured since it's something I haven't done it might be fun to chat with some of them.
However I don't know how to meet many of them without coming across as being out of place. Meeting the non speaking characters seems like I'll come off as too old and especially any female face character I could see a meeting being misconstrued as kinda creepy.  I'm slightly awkward in conversation, so I can't see myself seamlessly keeping a flow of conversation going like I see some of the videos of solo travelers do. 
I'm not that bad, I can hold my own in college without panicking whenever anyone talks to me but I'm also kinda oblivious to some of the finer subtleties of reading what people are saying. I could see myself maybe joking around with the princes or some of the funny characters like Gaston but can't really see myself just being the one guy in line to meet say a princess and not have that go terribly wrong..."
8h6sza,1,2018-05-05,M4M - the Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8h6sza/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"I hope you can tell from my sparkling prose that I'm an adult. I'm also only looking for adult partners for roleplay - its like let's pretend only stickier

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

8h6zkk,2,2018-05-05,Missing internship opportunities,sunflower9009,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/8h6zkk/missing_internship_opportunities/,"Has anybody here missed internship opportunities before? This happened to me. I really want to work as a summer intern at this company. In the past, this company will email us about internship opportunities.

Since there weren't any email notifications that year, I decided to contact them to ask about internship opportunities. It turns out they had already posted about it online and already hired interns. They will not be hiring any more interns in the following year.

I am already a junior student and I feel like I missed the chance to ever work there. They only offer internships during summer and next year I will be a graduate and not qualify for that. And if course the way to get your foot in is to do internships.

The other issue is that many other companies have also done the same thing so I feel like I missed out a lot. What can I do? Has anybody here been in the same boat and what did you do to find internship opportunities?"
8h7hyo,30,2018-05-05,I am enough,Curryher,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8h7hyo/i_am_enough/,"Thank you to everyone who posts their story here and also to those of you providing support on this subreddit. I stumbled across this forum  after fighting with my Ndad on the phone and searching the internet for answers to my issues. It is extremely helpful and validating to read and relate to your stories, so thank you to all who are trying to heal and/or helping others to do so as well.

I'm 25 years old and now live with my loving boyfriend. However, growing up, I was the scapegoat daughter. My older brother was the golden child, and I used to be very envious of him because he received a lot of adoration and praise that I rarely did. I was always overachieving to, on one hand, avoid the yelling and wrath of my Ndad but then also to earn the love of my parents by outdoing the things that my older brother received praise for. Despite getting straight A+s in high school, getting into the top ranked school in my field for college, playing travel soccer, teaching piano, getting top accolades at the music academy I attended, not drinking/partying/doing drugs/dating, it was never enough for my Ndad. During college my older brother would fudge his report cards to escape my Ndad's wrath. I would rely on my own hard work to earn the near perfect grades. There was almost no praise for this or anything else. It was always just passable enough to get to the next hurdle and the next. 

My nickname from my Ndad was Trouble because apparently that's all I ever was at home. I was often told by him that all I ever care about is myself. When he was angry, he would give me a countdown of how many years left until I was out from under his roof. He would look me straight in the eyes and smugly say ""well, just 3 more years"". In one instance, I was frustrated with the college application process and was admittedly pestering my mom for help, when my Ndad came home and yelled at me to ""never talk to his wife that way and to GET OUT OF HIS HOUSE"". I ran off into the woods where he found me hours later. He was angry at me for leaving and just said things like ""Don't you know we were looking for you? I was going to call the police."" The apology I got was secondhand through my mom.

I never really knew what would set my Ndad off. For example, on one hand, I would get yelled at if I wasn't practicing piano enough. Then on the other, I'd also get yelled at for practicing ""so much that it's drilled into his brain"". My parents would always close the door to the room with the piano loudly while I was practicing, so eventually I learned to just close the door before I sat down to play. Ironically, nowadays they complain about how much they miss the piano being played and having live music in the house.  

On another occasion, I did not have a job during the summer after my second year of college. I spent that summer playing a lot of video games and enjoying the much needed break between semesters. My Ndad would tease me relentlessly for playing games, wasting my life away, being in the same spot since he last saw me etc. At the end of the summer he came into my room berating me for being a failure. He said he didn't know where he went wrong with me and cried in front of me saying he thinks about driving into traffic to kill himself because I turned out so rotten. This was all because I didn't get a job one summer. I went on to get internships every summer after and got a job at the highest grossing firm in my field right after college. Even when I told my Ndad that I got my dream job, he would tear me down saying, remember this moment when you're happy about getting the job because in 1 month when you're miserable from it, at least you can come back to this one moment.

Through living with my caring boyfriend and supporting myself for the past 3 years, I've become increasingly aware of my own character flaws. These include people pleasing, perfectionism, lack of self love/low self esteem, looking for outside validation, spiraling negative self talk, black and white thinking, extreme shyness, difficulty maintaining friendships due to ""chameleoning"" the personality of others or trying to be what they need instead of being my inner self, difficulty trusting my own inner desires, and fighting with my partner in unhealthy ways that I now realize I absorbed from my Ndad.

I've made some progress in trying to correct each of these points over the years; however, I never understood the underlying cause of these symptoms until reading the stories here. It is only now that I feel I've started to understand what happened to me in my childhood and make noticable strides to recover. I can finally stop trying to put a bandaid on each issue individually and instead heal them all together as a whole.

I was given a piece of wisdom from my boyfriend while he was supporting me that I'd like to share: Healing is like rehabilitating a building. If the foundation has deteriorated and you just keep rebuilding that building on the surface, it's never really going to solve the problem. The building will crumble each time until you can fix the foundation. So, to all of you going through similar situations with Nparents, I'm with you, and I wish you the very best in building up your new foundation."

I am fairly new to This subreddit, so I apologize if this has been asked before. 

I am graduating this spring with a bachelors degree in chemical engineering. I was able to get an internship for the summer with an oil refinery with a very generous monthly salary. They said they might be able to offer me a full time position but it’s not guaranteed. 
Earlier in the year, I had applied to a few PhD programs, I got rejected from all of them except UC Davis that offered me admission in their masters program. Since I have no money to pay for a masters, I SIR’d no. Now they offered me a pretty good fellowship package which is rare, covering about 75% or more. 
My question is what are the pros and cons of going straight to the masters after the internship. Should I turn down a job offer if I get one from the refinery?

Please don’t tell me to do what I want to do since I don’t know exactly what I want to do. I do like research but I don’t particularly enjoy being broke and miserable. Also I never tried the industry life. 
Your advice is much appreciated. "

I chose UT for financial reasons, but I've lived in Austin my whole life and can't help wondering what attending USF would be like (I've made some friends in the Bay Area as well).

I'm a rising sophomore Comp Sci/Math double major, so PY 208 is required to graduate, but not really required for taking higher level classes. I don't have any internships or jobs lined up for the summer so this gives me something to do, and since I need to prioritize internships in future summers I don't want to waste my summer taking it at a community college next year. I don't feel that strong in Physics though and because it's summer and the new curriculum it could be incredibly difficult for me. I know that taking a summer class has perks though since it's the only think you're focused on. Taking this class was something that I planned to do with my advisor and while I don't know if I *need* to do it to graduate in 4 years, anything that gives me more buffer is helpful and the fact that after this I'd be done with physics would be a great relief. 

Anyone have any advice with this? If you've taken it over the summer, how did it go for you?"

**V:** The CTO of Axeon, a major tech company based in Stockholm. He has recently been featured in international media as the centerpiece of a sex scandal involving himself and a young Axeon intern. He is believed to have used company funds to pay for travel, meals and entertainment for himself and his young mistress. As a person, he is usually firm but fair with a great interest in technology. As of late, he is beyond stressed. He is being investigated by Axeon and understandably in marital difficulties. He has slept little in the past weeks. 


Dress: Suit and shirt. Black shoes. 


**M:** A young professional working for Emergency Elite Services, a company which specializes in providing a wide range of services at short notice to traveling business men and companies in special need. She has less than a year of experience as a personal business concierge and has never worked alone on a high profile assignment. She is eager to please and is often praised for going the extra mile for her clients. She has tried dating guys her own age but often find herself uninterested in them. She is attracted to men much older than her but has never had the courage to do anything about it. 


Dress: Business jacket, skirt and stay-ups. Rest optional


**-Scenario-**


V arrives in Rome early in the morning. His assistant has called ahead to EES to book a business concierge for his stay. V is staying at the Rome Luxus Hotel for two nights in order to settle legal matters before the Axeon investigation finishes. He is quite stressed and it shows. 

M has received written instructions from EES the same morning with a note from her handler at the agency. She is at first unsure why she was selected for this assignment, but appreciates the chance to work on a high-profile assignment. She glances over the customer profile and recognizes V from the newspapers and TV-news. She remembers him as being very handsome. As she reaches his door, M is nervous but determined. She straightens her blouse and knocks. 

V opens the door and sees a young woman standing outside. At first he doesn’t understand who she is or why she’s here. M introduces herself as “Mal” from EES. V tells her that he expected someone much older than her and looks her up and down in a way that signals disapproval. M feels very small and out of place. She excuses herself as she enters and hurries to sit down. 

V sits down with his tablet and continues editing an email. He doesn’t recognize M further. This makes M more nervous and she considers whether she should say something. Before she can, V tells her to take notes. He starts giving M orders on booking meetings, reserving seats and other things he needs while in Amsterdam. M does her best to keep up with him and scribbles at her notepad. 

When V has finished giving orders, he sighs heavily and asks M if she speaks Italian. She says that she does. V tells her that he is going to take a shower but that he has some documents that she’ll get to translate for him meanwhile. M says that she’ll do so gladly. She takes care of V’s clothes as he undresses. He doesn’t seem to think of her as a woman, as he nonchalantly strips naked and hands her his clothes to fold. M is used to being treated like either a servant, a colleague or sometimes a slave. The agency carries out a lot of different tasks for a many different clients. Some prefer personal advice and a professional tone, while others just seem to want another person to dominate. 

V enters the shower and M finds herself staring at him as he leaves. M then starts looking around the room for the Italian documents. She notices a few old news clippings left on the dresser. She recognizes photos of the girl that was called “the young mistress” and realizes she looks almost identical to M. Suddenly, she understands why she’s been asked to serve on this assignment and why she’s here alone. The realization shoots a small jolt of electricity through her and she notices that it makes her excited and a little scared. The idea of being selected based on the client’s sexual preferences over professional experience makes her feel like an expensive toy. This feeling makes her much more aroused than she expected and she realizes how much she wants this. She loves the idea of being selected as the ideal distraction for a man who is obviously in need of it. It makes her feel sexy and desirable in a way she’s never felt before. M is pretty sure that V hasn’t made the connection between her and his young mistress yet. 

M can still hear the water flowing in the other room. She catches herself imagining V naked in the shower. She imagines herself walking into the shower naked with him and dropping to her knees in front of him. The thought makes her blush and she slowly parts her legs and reach for her panties with one hand. As her fingers touch the fabric of her panties, M feels herself lose control of her fantasy and the images just keeps coming in her head. She sees herself on her knees, sucking V’s cock passionately. His hand on her head and water running from his chest, through her hair and down her back. She feels herself starting to rub her pussy and she isn’t sure if it’s fantasy or reality. It all feels so real. She imagines his stomach slapping against her face as he fucks her mouth deep. Her pussy is wet and she longs to be filled by him. Suddenly, she hears the water turn off and she hurries to dress. 

When V steps out of the shower, M is there with a clean towel and dries him off. She now regards his body, not with the eyes of a professional, but with lust. She blushes slightly as her hands touch his skin. M drops to her knees to dry his legs and scenes from her fantasy flashes before her eyes.  

V starts laying out clothes and makes ready to leave the hotel room. He seems quite stressed and asks M if she found the document he asked her to translate. M says that she hasn’t yet. That V will have to show it to her later. V sits down on the bed and looks tired. M asks him to tell her what is making him so stressed. As V starts talking about the investigation and his affair, M seats herself behind him and starts rubbing his shoulders. V groans but keeps talking. He allows M to keep touching him and her hands wander down over his back and his arms. She tells him to relax and let her take care of him for a short while. V reclines and closes his eyes as M seats herself at his feet and starts touching them lightly. V is filled with a relaxation foreign to him. 

M keeps moving her hands in small circles along V’s feet and legs. His legs are parted with nothing but a towel to cloak him. M feels a strong urge to touch herself, but keeps her hands in place. V is hot after the shower and she loves feeling how his body responds to her touch. M then says in a quiet voice “Do I remind you of her?”, “The girl in the photographs”. “I look just like her, don’t I?”. 

V glances down and for the first time looks directly at M. His gaze is piercing and she feels like a deer caught in headlights. Her heart is pounding hard as she looks back at him with great effort. She has never before felt such a strong urge to please a man before. Without waiting for an answer she says “Can I please suck your cock, sir?” with desperation in her voice, “I promise I’ll do a good job”. V’s stoic face shows the hint of a smile when he sees her sincerity. He opens his towel to reveal his naked body. M says “Thank you, sir” and leans forward.

8hapyb,6,2018-05-05,What does Psyonix...do? (Serious question),ImmediateBreakfast,RocketLeague,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/8hapyb/what_does_psyonixdo_serious_question/,"Calling all players who've been here from the beginning (or close to it). Looking for some insight into how the game has progressed, and whether it's an acceptable amount based on Psyonix's disadvantages (like size) and advantages (like massive income). I'll explain my impressions of the game and its developers (I really hope I'm wrong). 

I've heard the same thing from many people (not implying that proves anything). To new players who've been playing only a few weeks/months or even a year, the situation looks pretty bad. Most players are used to AAA-level games, and how much/how often they are updated and expanded. Compared to an FPS or RPG, which have dozens of weapons/classes/abilities/maps etc. to balance and add to with updates and DLC, Rocket League appears to consist of almost nothing. It's cars driving around in a glass box hitting a ball... Years after release these games typically have a massive amount of depth and content comparatively. 

So my question is, what does Psyonix do? We don't have a window into their day-to-day activities, but what are they really focusing on? Of course, they are a much smaller studio. But considering the staggering amount of income the game has generated, that excuse doesn't hold as much weight, especially years after release. They won't release profit numbers, but based on previous info and playerbase increases, they've made about $200 million... 

***Updates***  
I've seen a lot of Psyonix apologists on here defending them as doing a great job because of x QoL improvement. 'Because before that one thing they improved 8 months ago, the game was much worse!!!' Some fixes have improved the feel of the game, sure. But come on, is that really acceptable? 

And most updates clearly aren't being tested much, as they introduce *glaring* mistakes or new bugs. I know not all bugs are easy to find, but even simple UI mistakes that should have been noticed with a cursory glance are being pushed out... 

***Servers***  
Many people are still plagued with connection/performance issues (that they don't have in other games) that make it really difficult to enjoy the game, especially ranked. 'Well my ping is always great now and I haven't had rubberbanding since x update'. Good for you, thousands of players are having an inexcusably bad experience. 'Well they said ___ isn't the problem!!!' So what? Most other games take their millions and millions in profits and make it work, Psyonix could too if they really wanted. Obviously some people just have bad internet, but many are *only* having issues with Rocket League. 

***Player Reporting***  
Smurfing, boosting, de-ranking, griefing, afk crate farming, etc. I'll keep these brief as they could be their own post. In summary, fix it. Players are reported over and over with nothing happening. 'But I saw someone get banned.' How many have you and others seen not get banned? There's an in-game reporting feature, why aren't they responding to reports? Why is a Diamond 3 allowed to queue with their Silver 2 friend? Many of these issues are not overly complicated to fix or at least drastically reduce. 

***Crates***  
This is what appears to be their only focus, the **~~gamble boxes~~** oops I mean **~~cash cows~~** oops I ^mean ^^exciting ^new ^^items...  
The one thing that doesn't fail to get refreshed consistently and even sometimes too often, is their crates. Gotta keep raking in those millions preying on impulsive gambling while ignoring glaring issues with their incredibly sophisticated 'hit the ball in the box' game eh? 

The funny thing is, they don't even get this right. Most of the items look absolutely terrible, and I often wonder if they even have an art team anymore or if they pay a couple interns to whip up most crate items in a week. Why do they think players will be excited to put hot dogs and flowers on their car? Most boosts and wheels are surprisingly bad and unimaginative, even some of the black market items (looking at you, Toon - how was this not an Import...). There's usually one wheel and BMD that are actually worth pursuing. Yes, there's always going to be a 'best' item but that doesn't mean the rest can't at least be useable. 

**Conclusion/TL;DR**  
I'm not implying Psyonix is doing *nothing*. It just seems they could be doing a whole more to benefit the player experience instead of focusing on profits. Pushing 3 years and **$200 million** later, game performance is a joke for many players. Loot crates are the clear focus but they're failing at that too. ""We're listening to feedback"" is worthless with little action. Adding flashy connection status indicators to try and shift blame is insulting. Fix performance, improve connection quality, swing the ban hammer. 

Am I being overly critical? Was the game an absolute mess in the early days? Have they made $200 million in quality improvements for players? 

Thanks for reading my whiny rant. It probably sounds like I hate this game, but I really do enjoy it (when it works). I just want to see it reach its full potential. "
8hasdr,14,2018-05-05,GPA and its importance,rpithowaway100,RPI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/8hasdr/gpa_and_its_importance/,"Current CS major in Algo and PSoft right now. I have done everything I can to crack the books and prioritize education over everything else. I've used all resources at my expense, ie office hours and ALAC, and have spent countless hours studying each week. I got my homeworks in on time and did fairly well on them. I average a low A in hw for both classes, but its the exams that I just really suck at. I can do back exams but to no avail. I just have a really hard time taking tests for some reason. I always have, even in high school. Unfortunately in a lot of classes, its exams that make up a bulk of the grade. 

I really feel like my grades aren't an accurate reflection of my work ethic. I work hard and always put in my best effort, and that's paid off in the form of an internship that I got for the summer. As it stands I have a solid 3.0, but thats going to go down somewhat this semester as I'm on track to get C's in both my CS classes. I know C's aren't the end of the world, tough semesters are a thing and it happens to a lot of people. But if I continue down the B-C range for my classes, my GPA is likely going to hover around the 2.6-2.8 range for the rest of my college career. 

Companies make it a point that you *must* have a 3.0 or higher to apply for internships and even entry level post grad jobs. I'm worried that this will impact my future job prospects, and I was wondering if anyone, particularly a graduate or soon to be graduate, has been in a situation like mine and how it impacted your job search."
8hb6ia,3,2018-05-05,Retake and Gap Year Dilemma,SunCandy15,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/8hb6ia/retake_and_gap_year_dilemma/,"I will be reaching out to my network as well for advice, but I wanted to also ask for opinions/experience on Reddit.

I am currently in the process of completing my first gap year and will be embarking in an initially involuntary second gap year. My intention was to apply for the 2017-18 cycle, but I needed to retake due to an abysmal and unexpected CARS score last year that was likely caused by anxiety while taking the exam. So I opted to not go through with last year's cycle, with the intention of applying this cycle instead. 

Last year, I had been convinced that I screwed up C/P as it is usually my weakest section. I squandered almost half my first break time worrying about some of the questions I may or may not have gotten wrong at my cubicle, finally snapped out of it and decided to run to my locker to get a snack but by that time it was a rush due to checking in/out and I realized I kind of messed up my timing/recuperation of focus after break. Got back to CARS and was still subconsciously thinking about C/P, but I'm sure doing that and the difficulty of the first few passages caused me to mismanage my time from what I had practiced and I unfortunately panicked and had to whip through the last 3 passages (think I was on Passage 7 with 21 minutes left, which freaked me out because I'd never taken that long to get thru CARS). I think the length of each passage and font size threw me off as well, but I distinctly remember being fairly comfortable with the passage info itself, with the exception of 1 or 2. Nevertheless, it is in the past in the sense that I can't go back to that day, but it still lingers over my head because I need to retake it. I took it in March 2017, so didn't get my score back until May 1st. I thought about taking it in June that year but ultimately decided that it may have been too soon before figuring out exactly what went wrong. I also had other obligations throughout the summer at an internship at another institution and I wanted to make sure I was fully present for it. I didn't return until August, so too late to try to rush for the last September date as well. 

Regarding the score, my other sections were good or okay, probably could have improved on C/P but CARS was the main culprit (504 overall). 

I intended to retake in January as I had begun my full-time service term and so I knew I would need additional months to study than what I normally would. However, an unexpected family death occurred around the holidays, I suffered serious roommate issues and disputes immediately thereafter, and my sister got engaged and married in April so I was inundated with maid of honor duties, all while trying to balance my service term hour requirement and studying. Needless to say, it started out okay in the beginning, but once January hit, my level of consistency and focus obviously declined and I kept pushing back exam dates from January to March then to May, etc.

Which brings me to my dilemma. I just took FL3 today to see where I am relative to where I could be for a May 24th test date. It's not enough improvement for me to justify potentially wasting money to secure a seat for a test date almost 2 weeks away at this point. I had always planned to take a week off from service before the exam, but even with that, I don't think it will be enough. So with that, I have two options: attempt a summer MCAT date (mid or late June) while trying to submit essays, secondaries, etc. (I would only submit to 1 school before getting my score) which would be quite since I'd risk being significantly late as my score wouldn't come back until midsummer. Or take a 3rd gap year, which I am kind of opposed to just given that I am setting back my potential earnings 3 years and would not start practicing until 33-34 at the earliest (would be almost 26 if accepted after taking 3 years off). Given that I'm a woman, the complications with childbearing and starting a family are issues.  I am also just anxious to get back to school at this point. I am definitely thankful for the 2 years off but never envisioned 3, especially given my GPA (3.7+ in Mol. Bio and spanish minor).

I know you all cannot tell me which path to take, however, I think I am just looking for assistance in weighing the pros and cons, especially if any of you have experience with the late MCAT + applying at the same time, whether negative or positive. If it is worth anything, I am a URM female (AA) but I personally don't think this would give less weight to score in any way, especially since there are tons of other URM's with much better experiences and stats.

I think my EC's may be good/decent (very focused on medically and socially underserved) but no sustained research commitment (just summers). That's something that could be a benefit I suppose, if I took an additional year off, since I can potentially continue the project I started last summer and I have always wanted to get more involved in that realm.

This post is getting long, but if anyone needs more information about my application to give better advice, please ask."

8hbiis,46,2018-05-05,[Very Long] My Experience With American Guests: A Rant,BurningBridges19,TalesFromYourServer,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/8hbiis/very_long_my_experience_with_american_guests_a/," Roughly a year ago, I had to work as a server in a hotel as part of an obligatory internship \(I study gastronomy &amp; tourism\). 

The hotel is located in the most tourist\-y place in my country, so, naturally, we had a lot of foreigners staying at the hotel. British, brazilian, japanese, indian, french, you name it. But, and I know this will sound so typically european, my clear least favourite were the americans \(and I was called a ''butler'' by an indian woman and made to get all her food from the self\-service buffet, which was located roughly 5 feet away from her table\).

 We had 2 buses of americans stay at our hotel for a week, that's roughly 70\-90 of them. They all looked pretty well\-off, most were older people and pretty snobby and the agency they travelled with was, according to my boss, known to cater to the richer crowd, so it was clear from the get\-go that they weren't gonna be the Dream Guests ™ .

The one that made the fact things were gonna go miserable with them evident right away was this one guy who, on their first night, came to dinner wearing, and I shit you not, a trucker hat with the american flag and the word ''America'' stitched across it, a black T\-shirt with a bald eagle in front of an american flag printed on it, cargo shorts, socks that were, of course, patterned in the style of the american flag and white running shoes.

I actually had to go into the back to calm down &amp; stop laughing for a couple minutes after he first walked in. I know that's rude &amp; inappropriate, but this guy was literally the exact character europeans think of when making fun of americans. I probably laughed my ass off for a solid 10 minutes in the kitchen. I had tears streaming down my face. I know I've probably offended people to some extent with this, but I need you to understand that this guy was literally an exact copy of the cliché american tourist you see in a bad comedy movie, at least appearance\-wise.

Shit already hit the fan when they wanted to be seated. Our hotel had a reservation policy that stated you had to let reception know beforehand incase there was a specific area of the restaurant you wanted to dine in, and guests were also allowed to come in a little before dinner service started to check out the restaurant and scope it for an area to their liking. They didn't do that. Wether they knew they had to or not, I don't know. Telling them was reception's job, which we tried explaining to them, but they just ***wouldn't listen***. They started going on about how we were *''Withholding them proper service because they were american,''* which wasn't true. We had a group of americans every other week and they were all treated according to how they treated us; if you're nice &amp; understanding we're nice &amp; understanding, if you're not, we're not.

After eventually getting them to settle down and sit, it was time for them to order drinks. This didn't go down well with them either, because, allegedly, they were promised free drinks with meals upon reservation. That was a lie. My boss went to reception and had them pull up a copy of their reservation from our registry, and there was no mention of free drinks anywhere. Their reservation was made on a half\-board basis, meaning they get breakfast &amp; dinner and have to pay extra for drinks. The fact they were seated next to a japanese group who had drinks included in their reservation obviously didn't help. They went **livid.** Many of them started screaming and didn't stop until they were threatened with having to leave the restaurant.

They were calm for a bit, until they were done with appetizers. That night, we had 5 servers working in a restaurant that seated 500. We were well into dinner service, so the restaurant was jam packed and the servers did the bussing, were taking the drink orders &amp; serving drinks and seating people who had reserved tables in specific areas beforehand. So each of the servers was catering to about 100 people, doing all those tasks for each of them. We barely had a moment to come up for air. Of course, they didn't understand that. They complained and complained, threw side\-eye at anyone who passed and were extremely rude once someone came to clean up their tables. That, paired with countless ''You look tired'' and ''You should smile more''s was what made me hate them for the rest of the week.

To top it off, altogether, they tipped a grand total of **a dollar**. [Here's](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&amp;From=USD&amp;To=EUR) how much that is in euro in current exhange rates, if you're curious.

\(Just for clarification and possibly damage control, I'm not saying **ALL** american tourists behave like this. I'm just saying this particular group was a bunch of assholes and they happened to be american.\)"
8hc2ew,4,2018-05-05,"Help, I need your advice! Pre-Dentistry as a Chemistry B.S. major!",FlourenceSummers,UCSantaBarbara,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/8hc2ew/help_i_need_your_advice_predentistry_as_a/,"Hi Guys! 

I'm a Fall '18 transfer student currently debating between UC Santa Barbara and UC Davis, and honestly I'm really torn. I'm thinking about becoming a Dentist and I want to attend a school which has the resources/advising/support I need to achieve my dream.

I have a couple of questions I wanted to ask students, because I don't know how much of what the reps on the phone tell me is accurate or just hype. 
If you just want to answer a few questions, or give me some basic advice: that's welcome too! I have a lot of questions, so I wouldn't blame you for only wanting to address a few :)


**1) I heard there is advising for students who intend to go into pre-health professions. Is their advising good?**

i)Do they help you with the admissions/DAT process? 

ii) Are they snobby, and unhelpful for the most part? Or are they friendly and have a lot of resources to give?

iii) How accessible is this advising (ex: is it difficult to get in contact with them, are their appointments limited etc.)
 
iv) Do they help you with applying for internships? How difficult is it to get one which pertains to pre-health?



**2) How is the chemistry department?**

i) Are the advisors/counselors/professors good (as in want to help you to succeed) or is it for the most part passive, and you have to look for things yourself?

ii) Are STEM students more collaborative or competitive? Obviously, I know that STEM fields are quite competitive, but I believe that people shouldn't be looked down upon for not understanding concepts. 

iii) How much of the courses are taught/handled by TA's? Do they grade your work, does the professor not matter at all?

iv) On a scale of 1-10 how difficult would you say the courses are for chemistry? I'm prepared to work hard, but are the courses ridiculously difficult and need hours upon hours for you to get through them? Is free time an actuality?

v) How difficult is it to find a research position? Is there a lot of competition?

vi) UCSB has a 20:1 professor to student ratio, but how applicable is this for STEM students? Are office hours crowded? Are you able to talk to your professor much?



**3) Are there resources available outside of campus?**

i) Are there dental clinics/health clinics etc. which are nearby the campus and relatively easy to volunteer at?

ii) Would you say there are a multitude of volunteer opportunities available? 



**4) Other questions I have**

i) I've only ever biked in parks/ residential areas for fun: is there any way I can learn the ""rules"" for biking at UCSB? I was there during open house and it got pretty intense on the bike lanes! I'm worried that I'll bike too slow/do it wrong? 

ii) How loud is IV? Is it hard to get a good night's sleep?

iii) I've looked on some websites which advertise themselves to be for student housing, though through some digging found out that many of these places will often barge in on your room and not give you any privacy. I know the FB group is a good place to look for apartments and such, but does anyone else have any advice? 


Thanks a bunch whoever answers, I know this is all overwhelming but I wanted to hear your opinions as students how life is at UCSB. I love the area, and how friendly people are: but let's face it, I'm going to university to study and achieve my dreams :) "

On this subreddit however, it seems to congregate around:

* Software Engineering
* Computer Science
* Electrical Engineering
* Trade Jobs
* Science

I also looked into more entry level jobs that would suit an INTP after being rejected multiple times from bartending, waiting and barista interviews and trial shifts \(This was brought on by spitefully thinking ""If my peers can do it, so can I!""\) 

I found the common choices here bounced between:

* Laboring
* Database Intern

But it seemed quite limited and the posts were very old so I was wondering if anyone here \(Preferably in U.K\) had any insight about entry level positions?

I'm only looking for a summer position as I'll be going to university in September, so Apprenticeships and Internships are out of the question.

[I made a little chart to visualize my/ general INTP interests, the entry careers that relate to them and the requirements for the jobs.](https://imgur.com/a/Hy6q6Es)

It would be much appreciated if you had any advice on what do add.

Thanks guys"

8heil8,126,2018-05-06,Just got accepted for an internship as a Cyber Security Analyst! (Interview process in post),compSecurity,netsecstudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/8heil8/just_got_accepted_for_an_internship_as_a_cyber/,"Hi all, 

I thought it might be of some help if I put up the process for how the interviews went and the questions I was asked, and also just to say out loud that I got accepted for an internship!
________________________
**A BIT ABOUT ME**

Before I get into the process and questions I was asked its probably best to leave a small bit about myself first. I am currently a student working towards my degree in Cyber Security (4 years), I don't have any extra certifications right now, or any work experience.


________________________
**THE INTERVIEW PROCESS**

The process started with me applying for the role on a Frifay afternoon with the intention of just getting some experience for interviews so that I could get better at them, as I mentioned earlier I have no tech-related work experience (been working sales for 6+ years), so I was a little unsure what to expect from them. 

It started with me receiving a phone call the following Monday after I applied seeing if I was interested in having a chat about the possibility of an internship, to which I obviously said yes. We booked a time for the following afternoon, and they rang me to follow up for a phone call interview.

This lasted about 10 - 15 mins, and mainly consisted of things I am interested in, work I have done as part of my degree, things I am working on now, etc. Nothing particularily technical besides a few common knowledge questions relating to Comp Sci in general.

I received an email later that day saying that they would like to speak to me again, but for a more fleshed out conversation. Again, we booked a time for that Friday coming, and they followed up with a call.

This was with a panel of 3 people, and was a traditional interview to get to know more about me and my work history. What are some of my interests, things I have accomplished, difficulites I have faced and overcome, etc. It lasted approximately 35 - 40 mins, and gave me a chance to ask some questions about the internship and the culture surrounding the company.

The following Tuesday (5 days later) I received another email saying that they would like to speak with me again, but this time for a technical interview. Of course I accepted, and we booked a time for the following week for a final interview. This was where the technical questions were.

It was with a panel of 4 people, including NetSecEngineers and managing officers. I leave the questions below:

* What is DHCP and can you explain how it works?
* Can you tell me about your home network?
* What is my goal over the next few years? 
   * Lead to what certs I am working towards (CSX, CEH, and SEC+ in the next 18 - 24 months) 
* Difference between threat, vulnerability, and exploit
* What are some common ports and services?
* Can you explain what telnet is? 
                 * which lead into why is it not used anymore?
* What port does ping operate over? (trick question!)
* Explain XSS
   * Which lead into questions about XST, SQLi, WebAppSec, etc.
   * Also lead into explaining the difference between reflective and persistent
* My experience with SQL, NoSQL, MySQL, etc.
* Where do I get news about CyberSec from?
* How do I protect myself and my network?
* Questions about the work on my GitHub page - (i'll link it if it helps anyone - mainly reports on File System forensics and some papers on web app security, and buffer overflows)
* Securing PHP and JS
* Experience with cloud services: Azure, AWS, etc.
* Experience with firewalls, networking, etc.
* Expereince with encryption
* Should you encrypt or compress first?
* What is salting and how is it used?
* How should private data be stored on a server?
* How should that data be retrieved?
   * Which lead into public key infrastructure, Assymetric vs Symettric keys, etc.
* Explain the implications for an organisation under GDPR
* SSL, TLS, and HTTPS


This third round interview lasted approximately an hour, and being my first technical interview I wasn't sure what to expect, luckily I was able to answer all their questions, not in as much detail as I would have liked for some (experience with SQL but not NoSQL, etc.) but overall went well. I didn't hear back then until the following Friday morning, 10 days later, which when they offered me the position.

Hopefully this will be helpful to someone! If anyone has any questions feel free to ask me and I'll get answer as soon as I can!

* I am coming out of college with $0 in debt. I currently have $200 of expenses and $600 in an emergency savings account. Do I need to add any more to that account?

* I currently have $5100 into a mutual fund through a financial firm. Is this the best place for my money or should I do something else with it?

* At tax season, my mom advised me to put $1000 into a Traditional IRA to get a tax break. I received $300 back from my taxes which I threw back into my mutual funds. Is this the right step to take, or since I am very young, should I be using Roth IRAs?

**THE BOOT**

Every summer for as long as you can try remember, Daddy has brought on new hands to help around the farm. They rarely stay but more a few months, and most of them are beneath your notice; but then, *he* showed up. A real, proper cowboy, if ever a thing existed. It's as though he just rode in one day: no name, no past. Not that that stopped you from inventing backstories of your own. In your mind, he could be anything from an outlaw, laying low on your farm, to a grieving widower, his silence a symptom of his angst. You wanted nothing more than to unwrap his mystery... among *other* things.

It just so happened that today, Daddy had gone into town on business. From past experience, you knew that he likely wouldn't be back before sundown. That just left you and the enigmatic farmhand. From the comfort of the house, you could see him toiling away in the field, digging fence posts. Every now and then, he'd stop to wipe the sweat from his tanned brow; his muscles bulged through his shirt, and you wondered what it might feel like to be wrapped up in those arms. Surely, it wouldn't hurt to bring him some fresh lemonade? He *had* been working all morning, after all, and deserved a good break...

-----

**THE WHITE TENNIS SHOE**

For some stupid reason, you thought things would get easier once you made resident. There'd be less pressure, or you'd stop getting so much bitch work, or *something*. Well, turns out that it's really just more of the same, except now you're judged even more harshly for every little fuck-up. There are times when you want to pull your hair out, times you just want to break down and cry, and times like today: when all you want is a good, hard fuck to de-stress. How long has it been? *Too* long, judging by the way you're chomping on that pen cap between your teeth.

Standing at the nurses station, you survey your options, such as they are. Admittedly, there aren't too many likely candidates. That's when you see one of your interns. He's a chipper one -- bit annoying, really -- still too new to medicine to be beaten down into cynicism, but he's cute... in a wide-eyed, bushy-tailed kinda way. He catches you staring and gives a crooked, little smile. For the first time, you really notice the brilliant blue shade of his eyes. It's decided, then; you'll drag him into the on-call room and find out if that eager, ""go-getter"" attitude of his extends to pleasing a woman.

-----

**THE CROSS TRAINER**

There he was again. Of course, you *knew* he'd be here. Through trial-and-error, you had figured out the exact times he liked to lift and adjusted your gym habits to match. Had he noticed you? Hard to say; he was nothing if not focused during his workout. If you were being honest, it was one of the things that turned you on about him. It wasn't hard imagining him making that scrunched-up face of determination or those effortful grunts in *other* situations, and imagine you had. Suffice it to say, there had been more than one night you took a little extra time in the showers before heading home. Now, if only you could work up the courage to speak to him...

Apparently, it was a chest-and-back day for him. *That's good,* you thought, *Wouldn't want the lower body weakened now, would we?* As he posted up on one of the free weight benches, dumbbells in each hand, you went to a squat rack conveniently in his sightline. No sense in being subtle, right? Besides, all this extra working out *had* been good for your body, and the leggings you wore today made you feel particularly confident. Halfway through the set, you thought you caught him looking at you through the floor-length mirror. Emboldened, you began to exaggerate your motions, proper posture be damned. Enough was enough: you didn't plan on another lonely cooldown in the showers.

-----

**THE OXFORD**

You'd worked harder in the last three months than maybe through all of college combined. The hours at this internship were... long, to say the least. Not that you were complaining; this was the perfect landing spot coming out of school, you enjoyed the work, you liked all your coworkers, and you liked your boss. Okay, you *really* liked your boss. It wouldn't be entirely incorrect to say that you had a crush on him. With his impeccably-styled black hair and those fitted suits, you suspected you weren't alone in your feelings. There was just one problem: that little gold band on his finger.

He kept a picture of his wife on his desk. She was the model of southern beauty: all feathered blonde hair and perfectly-white teeth. You were jealous, yes, but shouldn't *she* be jealous of you? After all, her husband probably spent more time with you than he did with her. Like tonight, for instance. The end of the quarter meant organizing a lot of reports, and you had generously offered to stay late and help him get through it. A good career move, sure, but also an excuse to work a late night side-by-side with him. Not that you honestly expected anything to happen. Still, just to be safe, you put on your reddest shade of lipstick and wore the lowest-cut blouse you could get away with...

8hgrov,1,2018-05-06,My friend I haven't seen in years just died and I don't know what to do,SomeCowFacts,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8hgrov/my_friend_i_havent_seen_in_years_just_died_and_i/,"I got the news that a friend of mine had taken his own life on Wednesday night. 

He was my neighbor from when I was five to when he moved when I was in high school, but we did go to the same school. He was a child of a very messy and complicated divorce, and when he lived with his dad they had no electricity and had times could not get food. My parents helped them out a lot, before and after the divorce, and he was one of my best friends when I was growing up. We would play pretend in the backyard and catch frogs in our creek. His sister was one of my best friends too and we managed to get lunch together in high school for three years until she graduated. 

I haven't spoken to them since I went to college and that was four years ago. I don't think I deserve to be sad as I haven't seen them in years. And yet I was shocked for two days and now it's getting harder to not break down and cry. 

Unfortunately this is not my first friend to die by their own hand. When I was twelve a classmate had taken her own life, and this pain is not as intense as that time in my life. 

I am also almost finished with an internship with Disney, and I have plans to go out and have fun for the next few days until it ends but I feel like I can't do that either as here I am having fun while he is no longer here and I don't know what to feel and what to do. My whole body hurts and I just want to sleep forever. I can't tell my bosses/leaders as they can't really do anything and I haven't even told my roommates as we are all leaving in a few days so it doesn't matter. 

I just don't know what to do. "

I recently have won a big scholarship to learn Chinese while abroad. I am having a heart-brain issue with choosing where I go.

Last time I studied in China it was in Chengdu. I fell in love with the city and the life and I have some friends who live there. I also adore the food. It's the only city I've fallen in love with and I've been to quite a few places. I also liked the local culture there and the people I made acquaintances with. However, the language instruction at the program that is available to me (USAC) is not great. It's 12hrs of instruction per week, plus some English language China studies courses. It does offer an internship entirely in Chinese however for like $100. Since my fiancé is also coming with me to China, a homestay is not possible. 

Or I could attend Tsinghua in Beijing. Firstly, they're Tsinghua University. Secondly, the quality of education is much higher and you are limited to just Chinese language study for 20hrs per week. There is also an internship available that is in English mostly. Housing is more expensive and so is public transit. I am not greatly familiar with the city.

Outside of class, I feel like I would get more language exposure in Chengdu than in Beijing. Maybe enough to surpass that 20hrs a week of language courses. 

Logically, I should do Tsinghua. No question. But my heart says to go back to Chengdu and see my friends and just have that comfort of being in a place I know. What do you all think?

Maybe I'd say a few words to you every now and then, have a pleasant conversation, maybe even get a picture at the end, but I mostly did it to help out the potential of working in movies later on in life.

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

I thought LAN would be a perfect environment to help with this situation, since a lot of us have cut off our Ns or are at least NC with them, and are trying to live normal lives by working with whatever ""family"" connections we have left, blood or non-blood. 

If anyone recognizes my posts, I'll just write a TLDR, and say that I am in NC with my Nmom for about two months now, and have been trying to fix my relationship with my Dad that she tried to ruin, this has been going on for about two years which is the amount of time that I have not been living in her house. She and my Dad are divorced and he is remarried and has a wonderful wife and kids. He left our home when I was 9 years old. He really sees my boyfriend, G, as a son, and G really loves my Dad. Me and G have been going out for almost two and a half years now. 

The fact that he and my mom split up when I was 9 and that I am now almost 27 is very significant, because I feel like he still treats me as if I was that age. He can be very patronizing, condescending, and puts down my accomplishments without realizing it. It really pisses me off because I want our relationship to be good and when I express my feelings he just laughs/shrugs it off because he's an ""easygoing, Christian guy"". I feel like it kind of amuses him to see me annoyed. He also interrupts when I'm talking and doesn't really let me have a word in. He's pretty stubborn and at times childish. My boyfriend says that his dad is similar and that all Dads do this and it's just a ""Dad thing"", but I really think that it goes deeper than that and he really doesn't respect me as an adult and looks down on me. I'm starting to think that neither one of my parent's actually value me as an adult and secretly see the other one in me and as a result don't like me.  I will now go into the examples of some of the things he says and does that really irritate me: 

He states I'm materialistic. I'm not even a little bit materialistic and I don't know why he loves to say it. I give clothes away when I don't wear them and I don't buy expensive things. I HATE the mall, the only time I go is when I KNOW beforehand what I need to get, I get it on sale if possible and then I bust out of there ASAP. I hate clutter and am actually very minimalist. Important fact; He lives in one state, we live in the next state over. My dad is a very successful businessman. When I was a teen and he would visit us, HE would take us to the mall, and my MOM would tell me what to ask him for. Every 3-6 months, we just became accustomed to him bringing us to the mall on his visitations. Often I didn't know how to pick stuff so I would just grab anything and it didn't even match, and I was also dealing with being made fun of at school, so he would buy me stuff at the trendy stores at the time, like Hollister and Pacsun. But I wasn't stylish or looking for popularity by ANY MEANS. And HE, on the other hand, is a total brand whore and has nice cars, nice high quality clothes and everything. He also tries to shit on me as being ""materialistic"" because when I was 18 I opened up a bunch of credit cards. But it was because I was miserable in NMom's house and she never helped me with anything! One of them was a Firestone card to do car repairs because my mom literally just asked me to ask him and he would say he couldn't!  I have since almost paid them all off. I HATE to be in debt.


That I'm ""complicated"": Well yes, I'm an adult female that you DIDN'T RAISE, so of course I'm complicated to you. All you ask is how is work and how is school, and label me whatever you want, so I can understand how you really have NO IDEA WHO I AM.


That I've jumped from job to job and have no experience really: Um ok, more like I completed my bachelor's in six years and a lot of my jobs have been internships, which are NOT permanent and have opened many doors for me in terms of experience. I have two and a half years of experience in HR, worked in one company for three years in retail before I started in HR, and worked in another company for two years BOTH as an intern and an employee. But he's mister Big Businessman and none of my effort matters. 


That I did poorly in school and he talked to counselors about it: No I wasn't. And no you did not. I was in college and over 18, so you didn't even have access to my records. And when I called him out on it, he was just like ""Ok.""


That I have a temper and I'm just like my Mom: I have a ""temper"" with him for what I wrote above. He talks to me like I'm some kind of dumb bitch, and I'm supposed to sit there and take it. And I'm NOT just like Nmom. Gross. 



I'm trying to remain peaceful with him. He is definitely good at sweet talking me and at least telling me that he's proud of me, but he really doesn't show it. I'm tired of calling him out just to get teased and ridiculed. I'm tired of being the family's punching bag they use to project.  I think he's just trying to make up for being distant parent. I don't really know how to deal with him. Any advice? "
8hhoen,1,2018-05-06,M4Futa - The Futa Apocalypse,weakthrow,futarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/futarp/comments/8hhoen/m4futa_the_futa_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you.

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of girls on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the girls, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the man down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The man in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the girls in the crowd moving now the foot long cock pounding in and out of the driver's mouth.

Jesus christ, the entire circle of them have them - monster cocks are being pulled out from beneath skirts, too tight jeans and yoga pants

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at that point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

Even as he talks the female anchor blushes and licks her lips, one hand slowly moving below the table as she turns to look at her partner

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from both of us being young to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/daughter, mother/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Everyone - Every woman in the world now has a footlong cock, the strength of a linebacker and the libido of a fratboy? uh-oh

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks  - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the futa apocalypse, not the futa group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

8hhoho,1,2018-05-06,M4M - The Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,GayRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayRP/comments/8hhoho/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"Usual disclaimer of course - we're all adults here, right? This is just a fantasy, and if you're not old enough to be on this page I don't want to hear from you

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

&amp;nbsp;

**Team DTNS - $370M - 4.4 Multiplier**

**Night Attack - $246M - 5.0**

**Cordkillers - $155M - 6.4**

**Johntrekker - $116 - 10.5**

**ChipsBitch - $66M - 3.7**

**Tell It Anyway - $0 - 0.0**

&amp;nbsp;

Just six weeks into the 2018 Summer Movie Draft, and some people are already calling it a two-team race between DTNS and Night Attack for the championship. Those people, coincidentally, are members of DTNS and Night Attack.

During the Movie Draft portion of *Spoilerin’ Time*, Tom Merritt has stated that whether DTNS can win depends on how well his *Infinity War* holds in its second week and how well *Jurassic World* does for Night Attack. Brian Brushwood allowed that while it looked like Night Attack “had too many studs to be beat,” *Infinity War* just might have a chance to carry the day.

Here are their comments from last week’s *Spoilerin’ Time* regarding the chances of each of the other teams:

&amp;nbsp;

Tell It Anyway: (crickets)

Cordkillers: (wind blowing across the prairie)

CHiPsBitch: (the vacuum of space) 

Johntrekker: (far off howling of a lone coyote in the desert)

&amp;nbsp;

This cheery disregard for their opponents comes despite:

&amp;nbsp;

-- Tell It Anyway having all of their movies left (including *Deadpool 2* and *Marvel’s Ant-Man and The Wasp*)

-- Cordkillers owning surprise of the draft *A Quiet Place* (which would have been not only the buy of the draft, but *the buy of all time* had they taken it for just the $3 required. They would be looking at a current return of 51X their investment. As it is, despite dramatically spending their final $24 on it, they are on track for a quite respectable 7X return, making it a likely top-10 buy, despite one publication--whose name rhymes with HUMDRUM--predicting it would be the worst buy of the draft and should be immediately snapped up by all *Last With 100* hopefuls. Sorry.).

Oh, and they have *Solo.*

-- ChipsBitch already earning $65M from *Truth or Dare* and *Super Troo*--okay, we'll give them that one.

&amp;nbsp;

But Johntrekker? They have released two movies (*Rampage* and *I Feel Pretty*) and, based on their box office take of $116M (on only $11 spent), are on pace for over A BILLION DOLLARS. This might be considered significant as the winning total was expected to be between $700-800M.

Brett and John are making no public denouncement of Tom and Brian’s cockiness, but if you listen closely, you will hear their voices faintly emanating from behind the vault-like doors at Johntrekker HQ (no word on whether sparkly silver dresses were involved)…

8hj7j0,20,2018-05-06,Arena/Assault Overview &amp; Thresholds v4.9,MisogID,FireEmblemHeroes,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/comments/8hj7j0/arenaassault_overview_thresholds_v49/,"Note: This thread has the latest cutoffs for the April 24 - April 30 arena season. Next thread will be the last v4 one with the current arena scoring system before the 5-match one.

Well, thanks to an unexplainable amount of internship assignments thrown out by my university, the free time I expected disappeared suddenly. I'm in a hurry, so I'll make it short.

Past season had a slight increase in cutoffs on a Wind/Earth week, most likely due to the second week effect with a rather low-scoring arena rotation. This week, we should have a notable inflation due to the Water element, yet it seems weaker than on past occurrences (likely due to another low-scoring arena rotation). Perhaps scores cannot follow the pace, but we'll see if data collection hopefully hints at this. **Estimates are a bit unreliable due to that.**

According to [upcoming seasons](https://feheroes.gamepedia.com/Seasons), Water is next as a main element, meaning that scores will still soar by several dozens of points over June. So yeah.

As always, **I'll need as much information as possible** for public interest.

Notes: Non-estimated values are ±2 points accurate. Max is the highest score reachable at that point (will be too tricky to adjust it every week). Assault Top 100 disappeared &amp; Top 3000 appeared with Book II.

**Observations &amp; Forecasts**

* **The Arena score inflation is dependent on available Blessings &amp; active Legendary Heroes.** The Wind/Earth combo &amp; second week effect led to a slight increase in scores after a significant drop in cutoffs.
* **Assault thresholds also increased a bit.**
* Current estimates are possibly conservative, but the inflation seems lower than before. Up to 10 extra points on all cutoffs as a conjecture, data collection will be necessary to adjust it.

# Questions

To get a better overview of Arena &amp; Assault habits (and giving ideas to other players wondering whether they should intensify their efforts or opt for build/team tweaks), here are questions anyone can answer.

    **What is your current situation in Arena (usual tier(s), score/ranking range)?**  
    **How do you aim for your highest affordable score in Arena (units, merges/builds, deathless)?**  
    **What are your main weaknesses/threats &amp; improvements you have in mind for Arena?**  
    **What is your current situation in Assault (usual tier(s), score/ranking range)?**  
    **How do you aim for your highest affordable score in Assault (units, merges/builds, deathless)?**  
    **What are your main weaknesses/threats &amp; improvements you have in mind for Assault?**  

With this, we would have a depiction of various game level profiles, from high-tier players to more casual ones.

Corrections will be progressively done over time. Thanks to everyone contributing to this tracking initiative."
8hjby3,2,2018-05-06,Internship at Big 4 still possible after graduating ??,alt-accountant,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8hjby3/internship_at_big_4_still_possible_after/,"This is my first post to reddit so bare with me.  

By credit I am a junior , I transferred from a community college so I have had a bit of a late start in terms of accounting classes. Being that I haven’t taken as many accounting classes as i should have, it’s been hard finding an internship since they require x amount of classes and a institutional GPA. ( being that I transferred in this semester I do not have one ) 

My goal is to work for the BIG 4. I have read that the best way to get into the BIG 4 is through an internship. With the way my classes are set up my goal is to try to get an internship with one of the Big 4 during spring or summer 2019 since I’ll be graduating Jan 2020. 

I hopefully will have a 4.0 at the end of this semester , but maybe around a 3.8 ( I hate group projects ) I am very driven with school and I love what I am learning about. 

I worry that I won’t be able to get an internship during that time because honestly I am shy and I have a heard time selling myself. 

The question arises: is it possible to get an internship with a BIG 4 even after i graduate ? 

Any advice about internships in regards to big 4 is appreciated. "

I'm an ""international student"" from E. Asia, and I am from Deerfield, MA.

I've been denied and waitlisted for admissions from many prestigious schools.

I am indeed disappointed that I've been denied from many places with high GPA and SAT... (UW: 3.94 SAT: 1560). It's my fault for not having a balanced list lol. 

At this point, I believe hearing good news from the wait-list schools is very unlikely.

I've committed myself to attend Stevens with their generous offer of a full scholarship. 

I would like to hear from you guys about the Stevens life and academics! as college life is different than what it was like in high school.

Oh yes, I will be an engineering student...

1. How would you comment on the Stevens' undergraduate housings? I am thinking of renting an apartment nearby. 

2. Institutions like Princeton, to some extent, give students inflated grades, whereas grades are hugely deflated at Cornell. How would you comment on the grades at Stevens?

3. What kind of internship experience were you exposed during your first summer? Did your professor provide you with necessary help?

4. What courses are recommended and not recommended for freshman engineering student?

5. I would like to be prepared for my first year, any materials or tips in preparing for the courses?

I'm kind of afraid to talk to people in real life about it and want opinions from people who have some experience with it, like presumably you guys on this sub!

Backstory: In my teen years I did a decent amount of acid and it gave me some really fucked up stories and experiences. Constant panic and anxiety, feelings of impending doom, visual hallucinations, thinking that I was being reincarnated or that life was somehow more AND less real than I was experiencing. There's a lot of detail I could go into about what I thought/saw/felt but it's kinda not important (if you're really curious there's some past posts on my profile describing). I kept doing it cuz I thought eventually I'd have fun like everyone else on it, but after it lasted like 3 days and my parents found out and I was hospitalized I gave up everything but smoking and drinking. The experiences I had on acid though (2 major ones) were traumatic and still like my worst fear is feeling like that again.

I'm 21 in college and love my life. Amazing girlfriend, relationship with my family is better than ever, super great support group of friends since childhood, internship coming up for my dream job, grades are okay... I do have depression/anxiety and take zoloft for it.

A few weeks ago I took a hit from my bowl and got a horrible feeling of impending doom. I felt like I was going back to the bad place I was when I was on acid. I haven't smoked since obviously and thought it would go away after I got some sleep but I still feel in and out of this weird mood like this isn't real life, impending doom like something major (maybe dying?) is coming up soon, and moments where I'll read/hear something and feel like my sense of hearing and inner thoughts have ""cut out"" for a second as I realize some disturbing truth about what the universe really is then immediately lose it, but every time it happens I feel closer to figuring it out, and it makes me super uncomfortable. I don't wanna leave my life but I feel like I will, like it's inevitable? Every once in a while. Some days I feel totally fine and when I think about these fears they seem a world away and I'm like ""guess I'm better"" and sometimes they stay with me all day. 

When I get the feeling the inside of my skull and back of my neck feels super hot and I'll get the worst pit in my stomach I've ever experienced and immediately have to take a dump, sometimes even feeling like throwing up. A couple times over the past few weeks I've woken up absolutely paranoid and inconsolable feeling like it was happening, whatever ""it"" is and was unable to stop shaking- like worse than even shivering. My legs, arms, thighs, chest, everything. 

I've talked to my therapist about it but as I leave for the summer I won't see him and I only saw him biweekly anyway and whenever my appointments were I would feel better the past few days and couldn't articulate it and he said it was probably just THC causing a flashback and I'd be fine in a bit. It's been 3 or 4 weeks. (He didn't brush me off, he's a great therapist, I just didn't really explain it in depth). 

I almost hope I'm schizophrenic because it means it's all in my head. I wanna hear that these are all just delusions, but even when I hear it I worry that I'm solipsistic and everything in my life is one big figment of my imagination or hallucination or my whole life was a coma like that one Reddit story or that Rick and Morty episode or whatever and it's scary. Am I just overthinking things and letting my fear get the best of me or are these red flags I need to look into? Should I even look into an MRI or something? Sorry for the wall of text and stuff, I'm just kinda on edge haha and have been for a while. I'm still handling my life fine (work and class and relationships) but it's constantly in the back of my head. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks for reading, I appreciate any responses I get. "
8hk0sf,58,2018-05-06,My parents are slowly waking up and fading,-KyloRen-,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/8hk0sf/my_parents_are_slowly_waking_up_and_fading/,"Figure I'd share my story here, I've been active in this community for a few years now but have deleted my account so many times that you guys probably don't recognize me. 

Let me start off with some background: I'm a 20-year-old soon-to-be junior in college pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I woke up around the age of 14 when my middle-school friend offhandedly asked to me, ""when will you stop believing in all that Bible bullshit?"" I was active on reddit at the time, but never really ventured into the /r/atheism or /r/exjw corner. So I decided to check it out, and the rest is history. I'm still not baptized but became a publisher at the age of 12 and have slowly stopped giving talks in the hall.

My parents, however, took a bit more time to get to this point. When I first told them I didn't believe, I was met with all of the same emotions most of you were met with: anger, fear, sadness, and the feeling that they lost their son. I had an eye-opening talk with my dad after last year's convention though, and it made me feel joy like no other. He told me that after I explained my views to him, he too started to have his doubts. After seeing all the changes in the congregation over the years such as the CLAM, overlapping generations, and the consistent homophobia and sexism, he began to research. He had a mid-life crisis after realizing his whole life was a lie, and he made a few mistakes. He was disfellowshipped my senior year of High School and was very hard on my family. I didn't know if my parents were going to get divorced, or whether I would have a steady home to come back to. Luckily, my parents have since sorted out their issues, and now my mom is beginning to have her doubts about JW.org.

Since my enrollment in college, they have been asking me less and less to go to meetings. When they do ask, I can talk them out of it most of the time. They even let me live at school this year under secrecy and I have maybe gone to the Sunday meeting 10 times in 2018 total, and never to the mid-week. My parents still go to meetings fairly often, mostly due to my grandparents, whose whole life revolves around the Watchtower. It would break their hearts if they knew that we are nonbelievers, and really don't care much for the congregation. 

My parents still want me to get baptized for my grandparents' sake but understand that it is not a priority and that I should focus on school. I have no plans to make this happen as I'm starting an internship in July which I am very proud of myself for landing. To give you an idea of how worldly they've let me become, here's a few things they've allowed:

- Me to have my worldly girlfriend of 2 years who wore a Ouija board dress to our prom (whom they love, by the way)

- Not kicking me out of the house after finding my weed, and actually smoking a little themselves

- Living at school, as stated above

- Understanding that I'm going to drink and party and have fun, and supporting my decisions

- Most importantly, allowing me to put the Watchtower behind me, and focus on my career and transition to adult life.

The point I'm trying to make here is that there is hope. If you told 14-year-old me that all this would happen, I would be shocked. Sometimes it just takes time and love. My dad told me that he was once ready to die, and let me die, over blood transfusions but realizes now what a mistake that would have been.

Sure I can't have back my missed birthdays, or unclaimed trick-or-treat candy, or all the time I wasted on the organization, but it makes me happy that I still have my close family, and that I can live a normal life from now on. My cousins and extended family may still shun me, but I don't care anymore. I've worked very hard to build up a life outside of the bOrg, and I want to keep it that way. Thank you all for your support and stories over the years. I've read, I've laughed, I've cried, and I've felt a connection with everything I've seen on here. You all are awesome, and we're all going to make it. Hopefully, my story isn't too rambly, and it gives some of you hope.

8hk5zb,3,2018-05-06,Encountering Conflict in Church,kazakhstanthetrumpet,Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/8hk5zb/encountering_conflict_in_church/,"Because of a lot of church choir drama this morning, I remembered this [book](https://www.avemariapress.com/product/1-59471-613-7/Redeeming-Conflict/) that I read as an intern at my college parish. I think it has a lot of great insight about how to deal with conflict in general.

Something that's really been bothering me today is encountering selfishness in the Church. I witnessed people at least 40 years older than me having petty conflicts, where one woman was making a big deal out of switching seats because she claimed that the woman next to her ""made her sing out of tune"" (implying that the woman can't sing), and then the insulted woman left right after Communion and refused to sing during Mass. On my other side was a woman talking about how it would be reasonable for her to leave the Church because of a lack of gluten free hosts, but that looking back at her ancestors (some of whom were beheaded for the Church) made her feel a sense of loyalty.

I know that a sense of isolation in the Church is an issue, but it bothers me that we live in a society where people think that failure to recognize their every personal need is a good enough reason to leave the Church, or that their immediate personal needs surpass the need to form community and serve God.

At least my conversation with the one woman became productive--we were talking about how many issues our parish has had, but how we continue to be drawn to it anyway.

And everyone needed to hear the homily about self-giving...not least of all the pastor who was giving the homily, who has repeatedly shown just as much unwillingness to give of himself.

I guess it's just a reminder that our relationships with people in the Church, important as they may be, can't eclipse our relationship with Jesus, who is the only reason to be a part of the Church (and enough of a reason to be a part of the Church)! My parish has had not great pastors since I was around 8, when we got a pastor who embezzled a ton of money and renovated the rectory into a bachelor pad. Our next (current) pastor is certainly not criminal, but can be standoffish and even downright cruel to parishioners. 

Still, the Jesus present in that church is the same Jesus present in my much more vibrant college parish. I just need a reminder of that sometimes, and wanted to post in case anyone else did too."

8hkdxm,7,2018-05-06,So many questions,justforvproblems,vulvodynia,https://www.reddit.com/r/vulvodynia/comments/8hkdxm/so_many_questions/,"Hi all! So, I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while, thinking that I had vulvodynia and was officially diagnosed last week. 

I've been dealing with this for almost a year now, and have seen, I think, four different doctors about it. No idea why it started, why it's continued, how to manage it, etc. 

This is mostly just a venting post, because like I said, I've lurked a lot already, but I figured I would see if anyone has any feedback too. 

I was gone for a month last June, at an internship. I came back the 1st of July, very excited to see my boyfriend (we've been together for 6 years). We had sex that night when I got back, and in the morning I knew I had a uti. I've gotten them before and had issues four years ago with recurrent infections, but had them under control since then. Went to the doctor, got a perscription, realized a few days later that I thought I had a yeast infection from the antibiotics. Went back to the doctor, got a diflucan pill. Took that and it did nothing. Went back to the doctor and got another diflucan, did nothing. By this second time, I realized that I had these weird sores on my labia, freaked out because I thought I had herpes. Cried a lot, because how could I have herpes when I've been in a relationship for six years and was terrified that it was from a stupid hookup however many years ago, and it looked really bad because I just got back from a month long internship away from my boyfriend. We get tested, doctor says it doesn't look like herpes, it comes back negative. I'm still in a lot of pain, vag irritated, and they tell me I have bv after my fourth visit and give me meds for that. I'm going out of my mind because nothing is working. Doc says ""well, looks like you're just switching back and forth between yeast and bv."" I'm like, okay gotta find someone else. Go to a different doctor (male) and I've been wary about male gynos. I relay the whole story about the recurrent sores/bumps from July (its now October) and he tells me ""well have you been having wild honeymoon sex?"" I say no, because I'm in pain. He says its gotta be some other strand of yeast, he bets his house on it. Tests me for all the yeast, comes back negative and he calls me to say, ""its gotta be friction from all the sex your having,"" even though I told him that I hadn't since I tried in fucking August. He says its hormonal and switches my birth control. 

I find another doctor who specializes in vulvar disorders. She's a great listener, and actually tried to come up with a game plan. She says it looks like normal tissue to her, said when the bumps come back she'll biopsy them. She's really hard to get an appointment with though, so it takes about a month. Biopsy just came back normal two weeks ago. She did the q-tip test and mentioned vulvodynia, which was what I was afraid of. 

So, its been a year of figuring this all out and I just feel both overwhelmed because its real, and comforted in knowing there's at least some resources and that I found someone who is listening to me finally. 

So, here's the game plan: I was on Nuvaring when this all happened, switched to Sprintec, switched to Mylan (I think that's what it was??) now I'm just totally off bc because I'm not having sex anyway, and maybe that's what caused it??? Got some lidocaine and that seems to be helping too. Have a dermatologist appt, just to rule out everything, and a follow up with this wonderful listening lady. We'll see what happens, thanks for letting me vent everyone!! "
8hl8ed,19,2018-05-07,"After four years, I've finally come home",Throwayay6575,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8hl8ed/after_four_years_ive_finally_come_home/,"I started dating my fiancé when I was 15 and he was 17; I wanted to know him as soon as I first saw him. He had big brown eyes and was a tall, muscular soccer player and I was smitten. But it was so much more than a physical attraction. I opened up to him about some trauma from my past, and he opened up to me about a pretty painful disease he had developed that no one knew about, except for his parents. Besides the serious stuff, I've never had so much fun with anyone EVER. We would lie on the floor in his room for hours, or in the yard, doing absolutely nothing. I looked forward to the occasional night when I could tell my parents I was spending the night at my best friend's (I still lived at home). Pretty sure they knew all along. My parents adored him and his parents liked me a lot. After graduation, we went to the same college. 

He was the first boy who opened doors for me and bought me gifts and took me on well-planned, special dates. I felt so loved. I needed him.

I was a sophomore and he was a year away from graduation when he proposed to me. His dad had an old cabin that I'd never seen, and he had asked me to head up there one weekend to fix it up for some event (long story). When I got there, it looked pretty bad from the outside,  but inside, the place was spotless and there was seemingly no work to do. Turns out his parents had given him some extra money to rent it from the state park. He built a huge fire and we sat at the window looking at the snow and that's when it happened.

It all sounds like a hallmark movie, and honestly, now, I hardly believe it happened. But it did, and our relationship became my identity.

Only four months later, a bunch of things happened in the span of a few weeks that essentially ruined his life. I won't go into detail, but basically in one fell swoop his family, his health, his career, and his lifelong dream were all destroyed. So he left me. He broke off the engagement and told me he didn't want to see me again. I was extremely confused and so hurt and I remember giving the ring to my mother and asking her to never mention it again. All of this happened in my parents' dining room.

I went hysterical. I wanted to be there for him but he had blocked my phone number and wouldn't answer the door. I tried to hurt myself pretty badly, I wanted to kill myself, and I spent about two weeks in total in a mental hospital. He moved away. I have not seen him or spoken to him since. He broke it off just a week after my brother had taken our engagement photos. Fuck.

It's been four years since that happened, and I have lived with five different men for most of that time. It wasn't so much that I couldn't be alone, I just had no viable option to get out of town at the time, as a middle-class college student with a ton of volunteer jobs and low-paying internships.

But I couldn't bear to be in my parents' house or even near it, or on any of the main roads in our town. Every building had a memory for us. Even some of the fields and ponds did, too. Just sitting in my parents' dining room would bring back a rush of memories, a physical feeling that still makes my chest hurt. For the first year and a half, I would hyperventilate in bed nearly every night as I replayed our final day in my mind. It sounds absolutely ridiculous, but to me, it felt as though he had died suddenly and I was still grieving. I think the disorder is called limerence. My obsession never faded. I would wake up choking on something invisible and shaking violently after dreams that he had spoken to me, even if it was just a sentence.

I didn't have enough money to get away from this place on my own, but I did my best. I transferred to a slightly better college and lived alone for a bit, a few towns away. But I hated living alone, because my mind flooded with thoughts of him when I was alone. I spent every moment at my friends' apartments, and only went back to mine to change clothes.

Then I started dating someone quite a bit older than me, and moved in with him. It was paradise. I poured my energy into playing housewife. It was so perfect, that I could be a ways away from home AND have the distraction of a human being. When we broke up, I pretty quickly found someone else. Then that fizzled out, and I did it again. And again. 

I avoided coming home and seeing my parents at home for four years. I bought all new clothes and personal items. I kept it all in laundry bags, backpacks, and a few boxes. When one relationship ended, I moved onto the next, like a parasite. We may have split rent, and I may have taken care of the home, and I may have even to a degree loved these men, but mostly they were fulfilling the fantasy of what I had lost. I would sleep next to them and dream of him.

This week, I snapped out of it. I realized how much I've hurt my parents, even though they try so hard to understand. And I finally accepted how terrible I have become, wasting the time and effort of these guys who have never done anything to me. I hate myself. I hate that I have no home and so few belongings that I tell everyone I'm now a minimalist, even though it's not by choice. I hate that I've gotten in the habit of buying travel-sized toothpaste just because it's easier to transport. I hate how flimsy and cruel I have become. I use people to stay away from a painful place and I've justified that for far too long.

I should add that I didn't consciously know I was doing this until the fourth guy. I really was interested in having a future with each of these people, but in my mind, moving right in was a fact of convenience. I didn't see I was running away until I HAD to come back to my town to renew an insurance card, and the memories hit me like a train. 

Today, I packed up all of my things, and drove to my parents' house. We've stayed close all this time, I just refuse to see them in town. But now I'm going to live in this town again and accept that something shitty happened to me when I was younger and I've been stunting my own growth by pretending to be a wife to relative strangers. I'm going to live in my parents' basement, not to save money, but because it's home."

Un expert contabil Bucuresti va ofera calitatea dorita
Un tanar antreprenor se poate simti pierdut intr-o companie atunci cand vine vorba de contabilitate, ajungand sa faca simple erori care pot avea consecinte devastatoare asupra afacerii. Un contabil poate observa aceste greseli foarte usor si le poate intrepta in timp util astfel evitand un posibil dezastru. Odata cu dezvoltarea unei afaceri si infiintarea unei societati apare necesitatea cautarii unui contabil sau a unei firme de specialitate care sa se ocupe de partea financiar-contabila a acesteia. De multe ori este gresit abordat rolul contabilului sau cel putin limitat la cel de depunere a declaratiilor fiscale. Declaratiile fiscale sunt necesare si obligatorii, insa rolul contabilului este mult mai cuprinzator decat atat.

Daca serviciile de contabilitate vor lasa de dorit in ceea ce priveste calitatea, atunci cu siguranta nici compania dumneavoastra nu va avea succesul dorit.
Acest lucru se datoreaza legaturii foarte stransa dintre cele doua, iar aceasta nu poate fi subliniata mai clar decat in felul urmator: contabilitatea de gestiune preia o mare parte din informatiile colectate de contabilitatea financiara, iar contabilitatea financiara are nevoie de aportul contabilitatii de gestiune pentru realizarea documentelor contabile de sinteza. Din acest punct de vedere, multe companii si chiar persoane fizice autorizate, prefera sa nu interefereze cu acest domeniu sensibil, atat de important din punct de vedere financiar, ci sa apeleze la firme profesioniste de contabilitate din exterior. Expertii contabili isi asuma raspunderea pentru toate actiunile intreprinse, raspund atat civil cat si penal pentru orice inconvenienta. Acestia pot plati daune in cazul eventualelor erori. delaconta.ro

Ca obiective ale profesiei contabile putem cataloga desfasurarea activitatii in corespundere cu standardele de profesionalism, atingerea unui nivel inalt de performanta a serviciilor prestate si respectarea cerintelor intereselor publice. De aceea consultarea unui profesionist contabil inainte de demararea si inscrierea firmei la Oficiul Registrului Comertului este imperios necesara. Spun acest lucru deoarece exista mai multe forme de organizare juridica dintre care un antreprenor poate alege varianta cea mai potrivita pentru specificul activitatii sale. Daca antreprenorul are ceva cunostinte de contabilitate poate tine evidenta contabila singur cu ajutorul unui program de contabilitate pentru partida simpla, costurile in acest caz fiind minime, iar in cazul in care apeleaza la un contabil sau firma de contabilitate costurile sunt mai mici decat in cazul societatilor comerciale.

Selectati cele mai bune servicii de contabilitate
Comunicare: contabilul trebuie sa comunice frecvent cu tine si sa te tina mereu la curent cu tot ceea ce se intampla in afacerea ta. Este important sa fie deschis sa schimbati cat mai multa informatie pe mail, pentru a evita pierderea de timp cu intalniri cum ar fi cele pentru a preda documentele in format fizic. Pretul serviciilor: onorariul perceput de un contabil difera in functie de numeroase aspecte precum: dimensiunea societatii, numarul de tranzactii, numarul de salariati, consultanta necesara, serviciile aditionale. Cu siguranta este bine stiut de fiecare dintre noi faptul ca orice afacere, mai mica sau mai mare, aflata la inceput sau in plina activitate, implica ca pe partea financiar contabila sa apeleze la serviciile unei firme de contabilitate sau sa isi organizezeze propriul departament financiar contabil, deci sa angajeze persoane cu pregatirea si experienta corespunzatoare.

In cadrul unei firme de contabilitate, tot timpul exista o persoana cu pregatire profesionala corespunzatoare pentru supravegherea executarii lucrarilor de evidenta contabila necesare firmei dumneavostra si se elimina riscul aparitiei unor eventuale probleme legate de nesiguranta calitatii serviciilor contabile executate de propriul angajat. Pornind de la aceasta stare, contabilitatea este standardizata, adica se bazeaza pe norme privind productia, prezentarea si utilizarea informatiilor contabile. Contabilitatea de gestiune furnizeaza toata informatia contabila care este cuantificata, prelucrata si transmisa pentru utilizarea interna de catre management. Ea descrie circuitul patrimonial intern al intreprinderii, definit de activitatile consumatoare de resurse si producatoare de rezultate.

For calculating the overall heat transfer coefficient I'm using the iterating method. First I assumed a overall heat transfer coefficient for calculating the necessary area. Then I used my calculated overall heat transfer coefficient to calculate the necessary area again and so on (iteration method). 

I found that typical velocities in plate heat exchangers for waterlike fluids in turbulent flow are 0,3-0,9 m/s. By iteration my needed surface area grows, causing my velocities to decreases to below 0,3 m/s. By changing the number of passes I can increase the velocity. Is it common/good to change te number op passes while iterating? "

De cele mai multe ori, companiile apeleaza la outsourcing pentru activitati care presupun administrarea salariilor, creand posibilitatea de a se concentra mai mult pe aspecte cheie ale afacerii si asupra activitatii generale in organizatie sau pe alte activitati importante desfasurate in cadrul departamentului de Resurse Umane (cum ar fi recrutarea si selectia de personal, motivarea si comunicarea la nivel organizational, strategii de gestionare a personalului etc.)De asemenea, clientii trebuie sa cunoasca faptul ca un contract de munca temporara are aceeasi valoare ca si contractul pe durata nedeterminata, acorda vechime in munca si impune aceleasi obligatii financiare, atat angajatorului, cat si persoanei angajate. Furnizorii de outsourcing detin experienta si resursele necesare prin care reusesc sa se mobilizeze rapid, iar in plus pot oferi un raport pret calitate mai bun. Desi outsourcingul aduce beneficii, fiecare companie trebuie sa tina cont de propria strategie si sa efectueze o analiza cost beneficiu prin care este sigura ca va obtine rezultatele dorite.

Servicii de consiliere calcularea salariilor 2018
Pentru a deveni un partener strategic in cadrul companiei, angajatii departamentului de HR trebuie sa poata sa gandeasca asemenea oamenilor de afaceri, sa stie contabilitate si finante si sa fie capabili sa ajusteze costurile si sa reduca sau sa amplifice, dupa caz, programele si procesele de HR. Nu este suficient sa ceara un scaun la masa top-managementului, oamenii din HR trebuie sa si demonstreze ca au calitatile necesare pentru a sta la aceasta masa. In acest fel, departamentul de HR devine un instrument de dezvoltare in interiorul business-ului, prin noul rol pe care il are: acela de a livra competente si solutii pentru imbunatatirea si dezvoltarea continua a afacerii.
Externalizarea este un termen despre care auzim vorbindu-se des in ultima vreme, fiind un proces pe care multi vor sa arate ca il cunosc dar despre care, in cele din urma, se dovedeste ca nu stiu decat aspectele superficiale. Da, aceasta are legatura cu mediul extern al unei entitati, asa cum ne sugereaza cuvantul in sine, insa adevaratele semnificatii sunt mult mai profunde si complexe. Externalizarea (cunoscuta si ca outsourcing) reprezinta procesul de delegare a uneia sau a mai multor sarcini realizate in interiorul companiei, unei alte societati pe baza unui contract de prestare servicii, in vederea obtinerii unui plus de eficienta si o reducere a costurilor. Costurile cu serviciile de contabilitate sunt reduse. Compania are de achitat doar valoarea stabilita prin contract pentru primirea serviciilor de contabilitate, eliminand cheltuielile cu angajatii, formarea lor profesionala sau deplasarea acestora catre institutiile fiscale, cheltuielile cu licentele de software, obiecte de inventar, chirii etc. detalii

Cu o echipa de contabili lucrurile stau cu totul altfel deoarece vei avea suficienti oameni incat sa poti urmari in detaliu ce se intampla in fiecare departament in parte. Raportarile si normele specifice protectiei mediului sunt inca un subiect necunoscut multor agenti economici. Legislatia stufoasa nu este usor de aplicat si de inteles pentru o persoana care nu este un specialist in domeniu. La fel ca in multe alte domenii cum ar fi contabilitatea, SSM, resurse umane, a aparut necesitatea externalizarii acestor servicii catre o firma specializata. Externalizarea serviciilor de administrare de personal le permite sa-si concentreze activitatile de management al resurselor umane pe zona de dezvoltare in cadrul departamentului de Resurse Umane (cum ar fi recrutarea si selectia de personal, motivarea si comunicarea la nivel organizational, strategii de gestionare a personalului etc.)

Servici profesionale pentru recrutare umana
Externalizarea acestor servicii te elibereaza de antrenarea personalului de contabilitate. Furnizorii de servicii sunt foarte bine pregatiti si sunt monitorizati indeaproape catre managerii lor. Nu mai trebuie sa mentii orice personal contabil sau contabili care lucreaza part-time. Externalizarea completa a activitatilor contabile reprezinta o alternativa eficienta pentru companiile care nu au resursele necesare pentru dezvoltarea unui departament intern financiar-contabil, sau care pur si simplu doresc eficientizarea activitatilor curente de natura financiar-contabila. Angajarea unui contabil este de obicei un lucru costisitor, dar pe care multi angajatori il prefera in loc de a profita de alte variante posibile. Varianta alternativa cea mai cunoscuta este contabilitatea externalizata, adica o firma de profil sa se ocupe de contabilitatea firmei. mlconsult.ro

Eficienta externalizarii contabilitatii
Dispare riscul de a avea erori in documentele contabile si rapoartele financiare. Angajatii firmei specializate sunt profesionisti ce au capacitatea de a repera cea mai mica greseala existenta inaintea externalizarii si de a o elimina inainte de a produce consecinte grave. Acestia prelucreaza datele primite, le verifica, le listeaza si le raporteaza cu maxima acuratete. Prin externalizarea afacerii, vei interactiona cu o combinatie de oameni cu experienta si calificare in domeniul de contabilitate, ce utilizeaza software specializat si actualizat. Astfel vei obtine rapoarte financiare corecte si la timp. Este asemenea unui departament de contabilitate extins, condus de o echipa de profesionisti grupati impreuna cu experienta si ideile lor vaste.

Contabilitatea externalizata iti economiseste bani prin eliminarea necesitatii de a plati un pachet de beneficii costisitoare unui angajat full time sau part time. Cand externalizezi contabilitatea platesti numai pentru serviciul de contabilitate si nimic altceva.Indiferent cum ai privi-o, a avea o echipa de contabili profesionisti care sa lucreze la registrele tale contabile, e cu mult mai bine decat un singur angajat in-house. Fie esti tu, un contabil part-time sau angajat full-time care preia sarcina de contabilitate, activitatii in sine nu i se poate acorda atentia corespunzatoare. Doar cu un contabil in-house e prea greu sa urmaresti ceea ce cumpara sau pe ce cheltuiesc banii departamentele din compania ta. Astfel apar si fisuri in livrarea serviciilor."

This isn’t necessarily gay related but you guys give some really good advice so I thought I’d ask it here.

Over the past year, my mom has been getting into blow out fights with me\(23\), my younger brother\(20\), and my dad over how me and my brother “have no direction in life”, how “we raised two losers” and “failed as parents”, yada yada yada. This is so far from the truth that deep down she even knows that it’s not true. That’s because these lash outs have nothing to do with us and literally 100&amp;#37; everything to do with this weird, unwritten, lifelong competition she has with my aunt and her kids \(my cousins, their ages are 25 and 22\). 

Growing up, my cousins were not the greatest. They were lazy, got pretty bad grades, were held back in grade school, got in trouble for smoking pot at school, etc etc. However, they’ve been able to turn their life around a little bit. My older cousin used our family connections to land a high paying job at a bank in Manhattan, and lives there now. The 22 year old is about to graduate college and is an aspiring surgeon, although he hasn’t taken his MCAT yet. They both went to pretty average schools \- the one who wants to be a surgeon goes to college with my best friend from high school, who just barely graduated with a 2.0 when he got accepted there.

For reference, I think me and my brother are doing good \(by my standards\). I’m getting my MBA full time at the local college on scholarship \(and I LOVE the program!\) while also working on my music career. It’s bringing me in a couple hundred dollars a week, and even if can’t be an artist I know that I want to work in the “industry” part of things. I’ve been invited to work as a producer for a couple songs at Def Jam, which is literally my fucking dream job and I hope to get a full time position there one day. My resume is pumped up with multiple digital marketing internships and there are so many digital marketing jobs in NYC, there’s no way I won’t be able to find work. I have no debt. My brother got into an extremely elite and top private school, where he is the star athlete on his lacrosse team. Last week, I was able to get him an interview at TD Ameritrade for a private wealth management internship, which he nailed. 

However, as soon as my Aunt brags about some minor accomplishment my cousins achieved, all of this goes out the window and back to “you guys are losers and we failed as parents” and full\-on tantrums. This has been going on since I graduated last year and I’m not sure how much longer I can take of it. I’m pretty close with my cousins, and while we’ve never addressed it I can feel it stresses them out as well. One day we had them over for a brunch and my aunt tells us how “johnny is gonna be a surgeon” again. My cousin angrily snapped back at her “Mom, quit saying I’m gonna be a surgeon I haven’t even gotten into med school yet!”

On the gay side of things, I feel like this is also holding me back a little from coming out to my family. I just know my aunt is gonna have a fucking field day with me being gay and will ruin my mom’s life. Also, these outbursts are starting to make me regret getting my masters. I feel like if I just got even a standard\-paying job straight out of college I could have avoided all of this, moved in with my boyfriend and tell them all to fugg off! But now I trapped myself in my home for at least another year and it’s just brutal. It’s starting to make me question if I actually am I loser even though I know I’m being true to myself and am following my passions. I know it’ll pay off in the long run but I’m just not sure how I should handle everything right now. Any and all advice would be excellent :\)

TLDR: Mom and Aunt in life\-long petty competition over who has the more successful kids. All four kids are successful, but my mom is throwing tantrums because me and my bro aren’t in “the lead” essentially. Ruining my life!"

Been a long time lurker on my other account, actually made this account earlier this year to ask for some stuff to stay connected before we both found some stuff that helped each other and our relationship was looking up from there, but ultimately it couldn't last. 

I'm still in school with at least a year to go, and my program's pretty rigorous, but deep down I know that's an excuse on my part for not putting in enough effort. She was super easy to make happy, didn't ask for much, and really only wanted the occasional PDA picture on Instagram, an occasional letter or care package, etc. and in the 1.5 years we've been in a LDR I've only done these things a small handful of times, and only very recently. 

The past half year or more we've both grown a bit more distant, our convos both in person when we meet up or on Facebook, Skype, etc. seem much less invested, fun, etc. as it was in the past. We've talked about it a few times, and things always seemed better for a month or so afterwards before it went back to old ways again. 

I want to say that after I'm done school I'll move to where she is and everything will be fine, but that's unfair for her to wait 1-2 years, and even after I graduate I don't know if I'll be wanting to do an internship somewhere, or if I want to pursue further schooling even further from her. 

Right now my biggest worry is also quite selfish - she's pretty, caring, super kind-hearted (she's been wanting to break up since February/March but knew I had some big projects, exams, etc. and tried to act as normally as possibly until yesterday), smart and ambitious, and she's super content with small things, and I know she will find someone else very quickly that is 10x better than I am, but I'm having a hard time feeling happy for her because I'm still feeling lots of jealousy. I'm also very worried I won't be able to find someone as good as her in the future after I start working, etc. Both of those things are super selfish of me, but maybe I just need time to get rid of those emotions?

Looking back right now I also don't know if we really had that good of a relationship or I was just content/comfortable. It's hard to think with unbiased eyes right now, but I've been trying to cope, trying to tell myself I wasn't that happy anyways, or conversely I was super happy and I fucked up, but right now I can't control my emotions to give myself an unbiased view.




Sorry, just wanted to type things out, I've reached out to some friends and family but nothing beats anonymity online haha. Thanks for reading, and I'll be sure to come back and update and whatnot. We've promised to give each other space and time to think things through, and I have a big end of the year exam at the end of May that determines if I can go into my final practicum year or not (hence why I don't know if I will take 1 or 2 years to finish my degree), so I'm trying hard to focus on that but it's so, so hard. I woke up this morning and the first thing I wanted to do was send her an ""ugly morning picture"" like we usually do, and dumb ass Spotify's shuffle song was a break up song that ironically I've been repeating a lot over the past month or so that's basically about how I understand I wasn't able to give you things that you wanted in the past, but I want to show you that I can improve and give you those things in the future, that I ""hope in the future you won't regret not choosing me, I believe you'll live a better life. I will be silent on the sidelines supporting you in my heart, because after all we've deeply loved each other"", and also about who cares if I gain the world but I lose you, and ultimately how the singer realizes that he needs to let go. (I know, sappy mando-pop songs)"

Maybe I'd say a few words to you every now and then, have a pleasant conversation, maybe even get a picture at the end, but I mostly did it to help out the potential of working in movies later on in life.

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

Hey! I'm Matthew, 21 years old and I'm looking for a girl to play as a celeb on this big movie premier. Ideally the two of us flirt for a little bit before sneaking off for some alone time. This can be as vanilla or as kinky as you desire, either way is perfectly fine with me.

I met my best friend 'Alex' 4 years ago when we were both interns at the same company. We became friends, or so I thought - after one year he confessed that he was in love with me. It surprised me and I didn't feel the same so I kindly rejected him. 

He was clearly still hurt and pining for a few months and I thought I might have to withdraw from the friendship. But then he slowly got over it and even started to laugh about it and admitted he had been kinda 'niceguy-ish' and that we wouldn't have been a good fit after all. Since then I never had the feeling that he's still attracted to me and we have just been good platonic friends.

Now, I've been with my girlfriend Holly for 5 months. I am bisexual, she is gay. And she doesn't approve of me still being close friends with Alex because I stupidly told her that he used to be in love with me. I can kind of understand her point. But I have never felt any kind of attraction to Alex and nothing has ever happened between us, nor will it ever. We meet every few weeks or so to have lunch together, or meet at one of our flats to watch some show and drink something or whatever, and I have sometimes crashed at his place because it was too late to drive back. I would be ok with not doing that anymore, and I told Holly as much and it hasn't happened in the meantime. But still everytime Alex comes up in some way, she gets clearly upset even though she tries to hide it. I feel like she basically wants me to end the friendship but he is my best friend and I find it hard to form close friendships, so I don't want to throw 4 years away.

What's your thoughts on this issue?

tl,dr: Girlfriend disapproves of my male best friend because he used to have feelings for me and I'm bisexual. But our friendship is purely platonic and I don't want to end it."

Does it not work that way for Med Schools? I did some research on this subreddit as my gf is going through the premed process and I constantly see things such as: 

&gt; University of Virginia

&gt; 3.8 uGPA

&gt; 520 MCAT score 

&gt; 300 hours of doctor shadowing 

&gt; 200 hours volunteering at hospital

&gt; Manager at (insert company) working 30 hrs/week while in school 

To me that sound like amazing experience that should warrant top tier opportunities. Do these people really have a hard time getting into top med schools? 

From my stance most people are applying to med schools their junior years of college and a some of those same students are getting in the top 10 med schools. How are they able to get into med school with just above two years of college education, good MCAT scores, and &lt;500 hours experience, while others seem to need so much more both before and after they graduate, even if they have the same GPA/MCAT? 

...

I'm not making this post to degrade anyones efforts or undermine the difficulty in getting into med school. I'm simply trying to understand the difficulty and nuances of the challenge as someone who's admittedly not familiar with the field but wants to be able to sympathize and offer advice to those who are.

I had a quick question regarding real estate. I am currentlt graduating with a BS in Computer Science in fall 2018 and I have an open summer since I couldn't get the internship I was looking for. 

So now, I was wondering if you guys think it would be smart or not so smart to get a realtor license in the summer. The reason I ask is because I am very interested in properties. I find myself looking on Zillow and Realtor all the time just to look at those nice houses and how much per sqft for my market ($1000 if you're wondering) .

Anyways, I would love to be able to sell houses as a side project (but I don't think I can be a realtor as a side or hobby, but we'll see) but I know it may not be doable.

From my knowledge , I need to :
Step 1: Must be at least 18 years of age.

Step 2: Register for and complete 135 hours of required education.

Step 3: Apply for your Salesperson Exam/License Application,  including fingerprinting and background check.

Step 4: Take the California Salesperson License Exam

Then from there, I have to find a firm to work with? I'm just wondering if I should stick with computer science or expand my capabilities as well towards real estate (open summer that I can get my license) 

Thanks!"

I'm not sure how ""easy"" this would be, but we are already able to do it. it is just a huge hassle. I doubt many would have a problem these days with 1-2GB more data for old versions. especially if it is optional.

**A default chat channel:**

If you enter the game you should be entering automatically a chat channel like w3 en-1. If I remember correctly this is how it used to be, at least with Diablo 2 and I'm not sure if it is a conscious decision not to do this, but this chats made the game so much more alive, self if they are pretty toxic.

**Mana/Healthbars having a different color from the enemy:**

Bears vs bears, breakers vs breakers, it is such a cluster fuck. being able to give the enemy different hp and mana colors would make separating the units so much easier.

**Maps:**

I get that it is a super in-depth topic, but in my opinion, this 2 maps are objectively broken, and could easily be fixed.

**Tirisfal Glades:**

- remove book of the dead from the mercenary camp
- 3 mercs shouldn't be available from the start

The main problem with the camp is that it has creeps with stun and slow, which makes it extremely hard to creep. That is,
if you don't have a walking tree that ignores all of that,  this plus NE being the only race able to deal with 
""book of the dead"" early on 
and that you can buy insta 3 mercs makes it probably the most one-sided map in the pool

**Road to Stratholm:**

the gold mine ist way to hard to creep and too far away. I think most would agree that human needs the option to expand in HUM vs NE and HUM vs UD.
Especially the summons are too much.

8hq44m,1,2018-05-07,Opinions on Internships?,skip_leg_day,WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/8hq44m/opinions_on_internships/,"Hello everyone,

I was wondering what everyone's opinions are in regards to studio internships. As someone whose working an internship currently as well as in the past, I can't help but feel like I'm wasting time. This is especially the case now that I'm out of college and paying a lot more bills on my own now and all that time spent doing free labor could be put towards my other paid job and helping my financial situation more. Not to mention my unpaid internship is a lot more demanding than my paid job which adds to the doubt I have.

Do you think they are worth doing? If not what would you recommend, or what other options are out there?"
8hqrzl,1,2018-05-07,Feel like I'm falling into a deep pit of despair and student loans,peaceepolice,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/8hqrzl/feel_like_im_falling_into_a_deep_pit_of_despair/,"Hey Reddit friends. I have been a long time lurker here and have finally decided to ask you all for advice regarding my suffocating student loans and how to live with this horrible feeling of hopelessness. 

A little background. I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania with parents who have never seemed to figure out how to responsibly budget and finance. Needless to say, there was not even a penny saved towards my education and any money meant for that while growing up was spent well before I could even access this account. My older sister, who is brilliant and has always done exceedingly well in school, implored me to gtfo of our small town and get a better education out of state like she did. Younger me didn't want anything to do with PA, yet here I am stuck back here again. 

I have struggled with untreated ADHD most of my life, of which my parents chose to ignore 22 years of for fear of me needing to be put on a stimulant. Thankfully I *just* made it through school however I was never in a good place to participate in extracurricular activities or relevant internships, enjoy my college experience, or even apply to scholarships. I feel like my time in school was complete scrambled chaos - cramming a bunch of info that I never remembered and relying on test/class curves to pass.

Like most graduating with a bachelor's degree nowadays, finding a job that utilizes my degree and skills without the classic ""5-10 years of experience"" is so futile. I got a degree in geology, and am currently working a contract position using my mapping and gis skills. I get paid decently and for that I am grateful despite the obvious lack of job security. My monthly loan payments are astronomical and, depending on the fluctuating interest rate, have been anywhere from $1100 USD to $1500 USD. 

Excuse my language, but I am honestly fucking scared and upset to say the least. I am roughly $100,000 USD in student debt, not including the interest rates on all of these loans. I have nobody to help me with these payments (my parents often say they'll help but end up not having the funds to and my cosigner is my grudge holding bouguie family member). All I really want is to go back to school now that I am being treated for ADHD and can actually read and understand things clearly without panicking and breaking down. 

Sorry for the sob story, here are my questions and advice areas I would love to hear from this wonderful community. First and foremost, how tf have you all dealt with this crushing feeling? I have tried a number of things and my only somewhat helpful solution has been to meditate and seek the help of a therapist. Secondly, what are some ways you cut back on certain expenses to save money? I moved back in with the parents to save money last September and it has been really wearing down my mental health. So I just found a cheap apartment I am moving into next month and any budget advice/measly but hearty meals are greatly accepted. Would going for a master's be a dumb idea? 

A couple more things about my finances. I have a car loan (no other way around it sadly as my 23 yr old car finally pooped out) which has a monthly payment of $261.00/month. I have a gym membership to planet fitness that is ~$21/month that I am not willing to cancel as my entire family is obese and I have no will to exercise without a gym. Anytime I want to see a therapist or my psych to renew my prescription I have to pay $50 each, which I have kind of stopped seeing the therapist to save money. I make $20/hour and time and a half if they offer overtime. My apartment will be ~$750/month with utilities.

Please folks, I could really use any small or large bit of advice. I am feeling really hopeless and drained.

TL;DR: Life sucks I have lots of debt. How do I be happy and budget for this?"
8hr3lz,5,2018-05-07,Can I Afford to Live Alone?,SeikoFanBoy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8hr3lz/can_i_afford_to_live_alone/,"I'm from a small midwest city, so I used to pay $300 per month during summer internships for school. 

I've now graduated and moved to Chicago, and it seems $1,000+ rent is the norm. For the past year, I've paid around $1,100 for a beautiful 2 bedroom in Wicker Park. I like the place, but I've realized that I really value living alone and want to move closer to the city in a studio / 1 bedroom.  

Problem is, everything I'm looking at is almost double what I'm paying now. Even in my current building, a 1 bedroom is $2,000.

Currently, I'm making $90k base and expect to receive a $75-90k bonus at the end of the year. I don't want to rely on this bonus for living expenses, so I like to go off the $90k figure - which roughly equates to $5.2k take-home per month.

Good thing is that I don't have any expense for food since my company pays for it all. I do have to pay for gas and car insurance though - but I'm trying to get rid of my car by the time I move.

I know I can ""technically"" afford it if I stretch a little, but I want to be conservative at this early stage in my life. When apartment searching, what would be a conservative price range to look at?

I have no special wisdom. This is purely an observational exercise by an amateur. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Ballerina” by Shay Hatten

&amp;nbsp;

\-\-LOGLINE\-\-

After her family is murdered, an assassin seeks revenge on the killers. 

&amp;nbsp;

\-\-TAKEAWAY\-\-

It’s okay to ignore the “rules” so long as your rule\-breaking fits the tone of your script. Also I’m going to stop putting “rules” in quotation marks; just make sure that you read the word in Aubrey Plaza’s most sardonic intonation. 

Here, I want you to note the first *Good Luck Chuck* reference, and then the author’s note at the bottom of the page. 

https://i.imgur.com/sBeAjtE.png

On paper, this breaks every conceivable screenwriting rule. It’s a pop\-culture reference, it’s un\-filmable, it doesn’t tell me anything about the characters or the rules of the world, and it’s vestigial. The first reference might evoke something visual or filmable in the reader, but the little note at the bottom of the page could be deleted with absolutely no ramification to the rest of the story. We’re taught that every single word in a script must have a filmable purpose, and this one most certainly does not. 

Now I’ve never actually seen *Good Luck Chuck*, but this was the exact moment in the script where I knew that I was in. Its purpose isn’t to specifically evoke *Good Luck Chuck* \(I tried to Youtube the sex montage and came up with nothing\) but rather to help the reader anticipate the experience of the next hundred pages. I know exactly what kind of movie I’m going to be reading, and most importantly, the writer is able to deliver on the promise of a zany, brutal tone. That’s a very specific balance and these notes ease us into the right mood.  

The purpose of the notes’ inclusion goes beyond the enjoyment of the reader and it goes beyond authorial voice. It’s about trust. We’re only three pages in and I can already tell that I’m in good hands. The rule breaking works because the rest of the script works. Take this scene from *Mad Men*, where after a copywriter flubs a meeting with a client, and Don Draper recommends a few tricks for apologizing.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP5Cd8i6Cb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP5Cd8i6Cb4)

The copywriter failed, even through his own admittance, by not being Don Draper. You get away with eccentricity if you’re good looking \(if your script is solid\). If you aren’t, it makes things worse. The good news is that you can lose weight, get a haircut, and bathe. Once you’re there, this kind of stuff will make you charming rather than instantly repulsive.

This is a writer who wants to bring you into the story. It’s an invitation to kick back, grab a beer and relax, because he’s that buddy who always tells the craziest, most entertaining stories, and you’ve got a front row seat. 

https://i.imgur.com/O5qH8QE.png

When we encounter this sort of thing later, we aren’t caught off\-guard because we have a sense of voice and we trust it. Just be consistent. 

Okay so, below, we have two separate sequences played over music. In the first, Hatten includes a specific song with lyrics \(audience gasps, the ultimate screenwriting sin\) written out into the fabric of the action. 

https://i.imgur.com/v4g13Pk.png

Later, he restrains himself from specifically naming the song, opting instead to evoke a tone. 

https://i.imgur.com/kVUtY21.png

This choice matters. What’s important is that reader comfortably follows the action. He could have written in Bach or Vivaldi or Wagner but I think that that leads to more confusion. His specificity comes from being purposefully vague. When we hear the term “classical music”, we all go to the same sort of general place. We get it. For the song, Hatten doesn’t even name it, he just writes out the lyrics. And that can take us to a specific place, but it’s built into the scene so that even if it doesn’t, we’re not breaking out of the flow. Again, it’s a tone and it’s a feeling. If we get the gist and if you’re tonally consistent, you’re good to go. Don’t worry so much about the conventional sins. 

There’s an improvisational implication to it all. And that’s the magic trick, I think. The reason that it doesn’t seem carefully designed is because it is carefully designed. That’s not to say that Hatten didn’t strike the right balance on the very first try. It’s possible that he wasn’t being so consciously meticulous, but this is the sort otfthing you see a lot in stand\-up comedy. That perfectly placed pause. That expression at the end of a joke. That stutter. It all seems like the comic is just making it up in that moment. And then you go and watch the routine the next night…

Whatever the method, it just flat out works in this script, and I often see writers discouraged from taking these kinds of chances for fear of alienating the reader. 

&amp;nbsp;

\-\-AMATEUR ADVICE\-\-

In the amateur context, the conventional wisdom seems to encourage first perfecting the craft, and then once you’re more established, breaking the rules to fit your voice. I don’t think that this is always true. These two things can happen at the same time. If the first script you ever write is a great script, and if it also breaks a ton of rules, no one is going to care. They’re not going to hold back on passing it along because you threw in a meta\-joke or splashed in some color or god forbid included some sort of non\-filmable description. I worked as a reader \(intern\) at a production company, and I never once passed over a script for any kind of rule stretching. I passed on scripts because I didn’t love the characters or I didn’t love the story. If the thing couldn’t keep my attention, I passed. 

But keep caution. 

I once had a college recruiter tell me story about some guy who sent in a shoe \(yes a literal, physical shoe\) along with his application. Attached was the message, “Looks like I already have a foot in the door!” 

That person was Bill Gates.

No. The application was immediately, and probably not delicately, tossed directly into the trash. Too much is too much. And my guess is that the flair was added to compensate for weaknesses in the overall resumé. Don’t use rule breaking as a way to blow fireworks in front of your reader’s face to distract them from the fact that your work has no depth.

And I do worry that my advice here is trending towards, “Just be a good writer, idiot.” But I do want folks to take a big deep breath and not sweat the little things. The rule breaking is just gravy. If the turkey is undercooked, I’m not going to enjoy the dish. If the turkey is awesome but the gravy is flavorless, I’m still going to hunt you down for the TURKEY recipe. Because I want to steal it and profit off of it and we can fix the gravy in post. 

So here’s my hopefully applicable advice. A script is a like a first date \(apologies for the analogies\), either choose to be yourself, or dole out your crazy in doses. It’s entirely possible that your kind off crazy makes you special and if that’s the case, go right ahead and let your date know right up front. But sometimes the best versions of ourselves are the carefully curated kind. Nobody ever fell in love with a quirk. 

&amp;nbsp;

\-\-PROFESSIONAL SCREENWRITER QUOTE\-\-

Daniel Kunka \-\- 

“ I think part of finding my voice was working for a studio and having access to scripts written by professionals so I could see how everything worked. I saw what was selling and what wasn’t. And it wasn’t just the ideas, it was the nuts and bolts. You pick things up from professional writers. Scott Frank starts a lot of his action description using the word “And –“ to convey movement. Steve Zaillian uses a lot of “\-ing” verbs to do the same thing. Or Tony Gilroy writes in very short staccato sentences, with lots of dashes, and as you read more scripts that work, you pick up on what will work for you. And I definitely had periods where I wrote exactly like those guys almost to a fault, but that allowed me to find my own thing, which is just as much apart of finding your voice as anything else. It’s “how do I get this story in my head on paper in a way that will make my reader have a visceral reaction to it?”"

I met my now husband in college and we were pretty serious by the time he graduated in 2004 and he asked me to move with him after graduation. His mom generously offered (or so I thought) to let us use her house in PA since she worked in NJ and it was vacant. I immediately picked up two jobs in this small town and worked around 50 hours a week just to try and save money for a car and us, but it was exhausting and I was never at the house. My boyfriend had a really well paying 16 hr/wk online internship at home. He quickly fell back into his habits of being her baby boy; never having to clean up for himself or really lift a finger in house chores since he was back home.....His mother would come back every weekend to visit and I would get reamed for allowing the house to become such a mess. I would talk it out with my boyfriend about the burden on me and he agreed he needed to step up picking up after himself since he was home all the time.......yet he never actually did it. When I was working, his mom would come home and make him feel like it was Not a problem, and then once again, ream me when I got home about my responsibilities. She went as far as to say she brought it up with her son and he said that I didn’t do my share of the cleaning, and when I called him into the room to clarify this conversation, he was blindsided and had no idea what she was talking about because she made it up(this was not the first or last time she tried to set us against each other). She really didn’t like getting caught in a lie so later that day she sat me down alone and told me that cleaning was a woman’s job regardless of how many hours I was not there because he made more money, that I needed to go back to college, and I was a failure in life if I didn’t finish. The next day she sent me off on some errands for her, sat down her son in some sort of intervention and told him he could do so much better than me, she had her relatives (none which had met me) write up letters to him about how I was a horrible person based on what she said, and even had her mother show up to back her up, except she thought I was a really nice girl, lol. I’m not sure if our relationship would have lasted if we had to stay there much longer. My boyfriend got a job offer and we moved a few states away. For the next decade, I only had to deal with her on a handful of occasions and the more time my husband was away from her, the more he started to notice she wasn’t the nicest or most honest person. I never forgave her and she has never apologized for anything. Life was easy until we moved back to the east coast 3 years ago. We now live around 5 and a half hours away from her, and she now expects us to visit her about 3 times a year including every Christmas as well as go on trips with her to the most random places during nonseasonal times to use up timeshare points she got suckered into buying. She knows how to guilt my husband into visiting and he unfortunately ends up using most his vacation time pleasing her. Last summer I told him he had to save a week of vacation time because I planned a Paris getaway for his birthday in Dec. Without asking either of us, last Sept she booked a hotel (with timeshare points) for a week in Hawaii for my husband and myself this May, and the hotel was non-refundable to guilt him into agreeing. Except we would have to pick up the cost of the airfare on exact dates with no flexibility. He didn’t even tell me about this trip until a month ago when he couldn’t figure out how to get cheap flights from NY to HI(hint: this particular week....there wasn’t any). I really think she did it because I asked for a week away from her, and one time she mentioned a trip to Hawaii and I said I wasn’t really interested (I like really foreign places with great food and refuse to wear a bathing suit so beaches and such are not my thing). My husband thinks I’m being a brat and want nothing to do with Hawaii simply because she was part of the process(trust me, it didn’t help), but I’m really furious because I know this reinforces her ideas that her relationship has no boundaries, and we have used this year’s week of alone vacation time/vacation fund going on a trip that neither my husband and I had no interest in going on and would have never booked on our own."

I took Thing 1 and Thing 2 to the park this morning.  While there I met another nanny, and we were talking and it was super cool.  Then this mom showed up.  She totally took over the conversation, which was kind of obnoxious.  She went on and on about how the nanny she just hired (for 10 hours a week) might be taking an internship in New York and can you BELIEVE she would that to her?!?!  Had she given me even a moment to get a word in edgewise I would have pointed out that putting her educational/business career on hold for a 10 hour a week job is a lot to ask, but this woman just would not stop talking about her needs.

She's looking for a nanny, but not one that needs full time work, she wants someone who ""does it, but not because they need the money.""  LOL.  Yeah, we're all in it bc it's our hobby.  She wants someone who ""has other jobs that can be flexible because the next few months are really unpredictable.""  Like, she needs full time for a couple of weeks, then ""max, 10 hours"" for a few weeks, and then maybe a few weeks of just date night, etc.  And then she's going to be a SAHM for a while, but still might need 6-8 (maybe more) hours a week.

Now, my MB and I are on the prowl for our next share family, and in the meantime this little girl would actually fit in pretty well with my current needs, but I didn't even offer.  This woman was such an unbelievable chore in the 5 minutes or so that we talked that didn't even really consider bringing it up.  We have a lot of chaos and confusion going on with Things 1 &amp; 2 starting preschool and MB1 having a baby in a month... I had zero interest in adding this woman and her, um, *junk* into the mix.

2. Tyler the Nurse- Remember him!?! He used to be in so many episodes. He was witty, clever, and capable. Grey's needs more actors that aren't worldclass surgeons

3. Cross- He hasn't even been mentioned once this season. He is great in small doses, funny and provides excellent comedic relief. Sort of reminds me of a far less capable, and dumber George. 

4. Joe- We never got complete closure on Joe the bartender. I naturally assume he sold the bar when he became a dad. And just like Tyler, a good recurring character who isn't a highly skilled doctor.

5. Tough call with my last pick. But I think I'm going to go ahead and say Finn the Vet. I wouldn't want him to return regularly. But a decent 3-5 episode plot arc with him showing back up could be interesting."

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

I am about to graduate from college, and have been offered my dream job at the company I've been interning for all semester. I was so so excited to hear this, since it's a creative field that's kind of hard to break in to, but today I was on a call to discuss logistics, and my supervisor mentioned that they would like me to start out working with them on a project-to-project basis for the first few months to make sure that it's a good fit before they take me on as a full-time salaried employee. The pay for these projects would be very good, but she said that sometimes there could be weeks of very busy activity, and then weeks with little or no projects. The company is really small (think less than 5 employees) so she wants to make sure that the team will continue to run smoothly with me as a member before they take me on full-time.

This really worried me at first, because the company is in an area with a high cost of living and the idea of not having a guaranteed income freaks me out, but then she mentioned that I could work remotely (as a paid employee, not an intern) for the first few months. This would be great, because I have a cheap place to live and a way to make money where I am now. However, I am nervous about this ""project-to-project"" business. Has anyone heard of this? Is it a way for companies to string dumb graduates along, or does it lead to actual full-time jobs? Any help would be appreciated. I really want to make this work, because it's literally my dream job! I want to be smart, and I'm afraid I might be blinded by my excitement. Any advice? "

I did look at CS FAQ that has been posted 5 years ago, but there are some lingering questions I still have.

I'm an international transfer student from CCC who have been admitted to UCSB CoE CS. I have the following questions, and I would appreciate if current CS students, especially current undergraduate international students could give their insights.

1. Is it hard to get a research position as an undergrad International Student?
2. It seems like SW engineering course is no longer offered, and from what I gather, has been added to some other course (lower div.). Should I be concerned since most likely I'll look for jobs as SW enginner?
3. Demographics for CS? Is there a healthy mix of international students and Americans or are there a lot of international student?
4. It seems like it's not that difficult to get classes from past posts I've seen, but is it still the same? Should be expecting to be waitlisted or is it easy to register for classes (up. div.).
5. I know this seems trivial but there aren't many reviews on Ratemyprofessor.com. How are the professors in general (currently faculty)?

I'm torn between UCSB and UCD as of now. It seems like both are academically equivalent, but UCSB has a smaller class size, and therefore easier class registration and closer rapport with the professors whereas UCD edges over on proximity to SV and therefore greater internship opportunities.

My apologies if some of the questions are stupid. Transferring to a UC is all too new for me and I don't know how the system works.

Thank you in advance.

As of now I think I have enough art buddies, I wish I could have more but I don't want to overwhelm myself haha. There are still a couple people I have to respond to so if you haven't gotten a response yet, don't worry, I'd still love to be your art buddy. As long as you've reached out to me before this edit and while my flair was set to ""BUDDY WANTED"", you're fine haha. But I won't be able to accept anymore art buddies from people who send a message after I've written this. I'm sorry!

**Where are you from?**  

* East coast of the US  

  

**Link to some of your artwork**   

  

* https://www.instagram.com/ceci.105/ 

  

**What is your preferred medium (E.g Pencils, Paint, Digital etc.)?**  

  

* At the moment I prefer digital (I usually use Photoshop to draw) but sometimes I get the urge to draw in my sketchbook. In that case I just draw with mechanical pencils mostly, sometimes I'll use micron pens in addition to that.  

  

**What are you working towards-What are your goals? E.g (The type of style (realism, manga, western), people-characters-landscape etc.)**  

  

* In terms of style, I'd like to keep improving my semi-realistic style while also starting to develop a more cartoon-ish/anime-ish sort of style that could be used for possible future animations or comics. I'm majoring in animation so I also want to start working on my storytelling skills through my art, specifically storytelling without much need for dialogue, if any. Flesh out my characters, maybe make some comics with them to work on short little stories, eventually create a storyboard and maybe an animatic with them for a future short animation. All of this would go into a portfolio that I'd like to have fleshed out enough by the end of summer so I can start applying to animation internships in the area.

  

**Are you looking for a buddy of a similar level or something more advanced? (N.B. you can have more than one buddy, so if you feel like you want both then leave this question blank)**  

  

  

  

**How often would you like to share work with your artbuddy?**  

  

* I think weekly would be good? At least to start off with. If possible, then more often but I'm pretty slow at drawing so a lot of times when I'm sharing my work it'll probably be WIPs of my current drawing or sketches instead of constantly showing finished pieces.  

  

**How do you wish to communicate with your artbuddy? (E.g Skype-IRC-Reddit PM etc)**  

  

* I have Discord and Skype. We can also just talk through here on Reddit if you prefer.

  

**Extra info about yourself:**#ARTBUDDYBUT

So I'm 19 years old (girl, if that matters) and I just finished up my second year of college so I'm officially starting the experimental animation program at my university this upcoming fall. Thankfully I passed the portfolio requirement for the program but I'd like to get a bit of a head start before the fall in terms of improving my art styles and having a foundation made for a future animation. I've PMed a couple people from here so far but I wouldn't mind having more than one art buddy which is why I left the question about skill level blank. I'm fine with talking to people at pretty much any level as long as they're motivated and passionate because that'll help keep me motivated! We can critique each other's pieces or bounce ideas off of each other or just talk about different artists we admire in the community. I've been wanting some online art friends for a while so if you're interested, feel free to PM me!"

For all not willing to do that: This story is 100&amp;#37; true, \(except a few details which could lead to identification...\) Berry is a fellow student, friend and something more, good looking, confident, and intelligent, brown eyes and hair, long legs. I am a former Med Student with an overdose of libido. Tall, athletic built, well hung, blonde hair, blue eyes. We started a hidden and dangerous, but extremely exciting affair, with basically no boundaries. We both were already in relationships. Surrounded with good friends, all not knowing what was happening.

This story is more related to my profession. I know, some of you would like to hear a scrubs story. But for all of you who think, “fun” in the hospital is common and happens like in TV Series: Let me say to you: it is not. For the only reason, workload among doctors and nurses is usually pretty high, lots of responsibilities and stress. Weekly working hours above 60hrs are common even in the less competitive fields. So A\) No time to wiggle a snake. B\) Scrubs are pretty damn unattractive and kill delicious curves of even the sexiest nurse and doctors. C\) Stress reduces libido effectively. So whatever story you might hear: Sure, they happen, but they happen really rare and if so, most often outside the hospital.

BUT: And that’s why I feel obligated to write this story: Sometimes they do. \*smirk\*

Before our final exams to become a doctor, the training program contains a one\-year internship at various hospitals. One can get an insight in the different fields of medicine to get a feeling how things are going in a particular discipline. Those internships are like working as a doctor, but without the final responsibility. You always have a trained doctor, who approves your decisions.

So I did three months rotation on internal medicine in a local hospital. Most work there is basically writing documentation, going on patient visits, taking blood samples, sometimes a thoracentesis, which really is it. Internal medicine is filled with patients having various comorbidities, often elderly people. As an intern you have a little bit more time to do a proper patient examination and I remember, I often enjoyed having more time to give a nice talk to a patient, explaining something or just have a nice word for him or her to brighten their day.

In my last month there, Berry rotated to the same hospital but to a different ward. We haven’t seen us much in this year, but she was attractive as always and I enjoyed the fact for her to be in the same hospital. Seeing her in her working scrubs, being a busy bee and acting all professional let me cross a dirty though to my mind…I would love to see the facade breaking.

One lucky day I have finished with my work before 5. So I texted Berry:

Hey, you need some help? She texted back, that she was doing some protocols but will be finished in about a halve an hour. So I just decided to go an look after her.

She rolled her eyes when I knocked the door and entered. I just sat beside her and asked what she was up to. She really looked busy and typed with great effort. After a while of not much doing except to disturb her, her then\-supervisor turned and said to her: Berry, I think you can leave now, this can wait until tomorrow. Go and enjoy the last sunbeam or whatever…After saying that he winked in my direction…clearly, he knew or at least sensed the reason for me being here. I gave him a thankful look back!

Berry had her working clothes on, her stethoscope in her pocket of her medical smocks. Her brown hair bound to a knob behind her head. And again, no one would assume the delicious curves of her peachy ass in those untailed trousers.

Right after we were on our ways through the halls of the hospital and I mentioned the book “House of God” and that working should be fun…and since were out now so early we could do a bucket list thing. She immediately knew what I was up to. After one corner I spotted a toilet, which is reserved for people in wheelchairs. Those offer lot more space. After a quick look to the right and to the left, we slid in to the toilet room and closed the door.

We pinned against each other’s without hesitation. I always remember her soft skin and her peachy butt wrapped in a cream color, fine underwear. Because of the white clothes, female doctors are aware of wearing discrete underwear, so no one gets a dirty mind during an examination. I loved the thin synthetic fabric and the good thing was, these kinds of panties get soaked faster. I rubbed her pussy through the thin fabric while sitting on the toilet seat. She loved being touched like that and arched her butt in my direction. We knew we had not much time. So she turns around unbuttons my trousers to reveal my now fully erect cock. I don’t know what it is, but her attention towards my “best\-member” always brings him to full attention…even more, I often got the feeling I could smash walls with this thing when she worked on it.

I enjoyed the tingling of my balls while she took a mouth full and sometimes I even feel like a slight burning sensation in my chest – is that what a cardiac infarction feels like? I don’t know – but I’m already close and I needed to regain the control over the stimulation. So we stood, she parted her beautiful legs, anticipating. Normally I would tease her clit with the tip of my penis, we both love the game of waiting and, but now \- every minute more could be a danger and someone might notice. So, I pushed myself right into her. That’s something only Berry can endure, she somehow manages it to take my cock fully into her, even with a final bump on her cervix. She seems to embrace the feeling of being stretched to the limit and being completely filled. Fine for me, this gives me the chance to let myself completely off the hook. We can fuck as wild and limitless as imaginable. After a few thrusts we changed positions and she rode me on the toilet seat…not too comfortable for me, as she too had no mercy on me and fucked me forcefully. So, back to standing this time from the front, one leg rising and deeply kissing. She kisses like she fucks, hungry with a lot of tongue\-wrapping, biting my lips and exploring every bit of me. I felt my orgasm building up und told her. This gives her even more excitement and I had to cover her mouth to mute the moaning. When I bursted into her, the release of tension and hormones felt incredible. When I pulled out, some of the semen leaked out of her swollen, red pussy on the floor. We both smiled at each other. My cock was a complete mess too, covered with a mixture of her cream and my cum. Sometimes she likes to lick that off…not today, I was too sensitive to take more.

The challenge was then to slip out of the toilet one by one and walking straight down the neon lighted hallway with an innocent pockerface. If someone would have had us caught getting out the toilet, our red cheeks, my semi\-hard in my white trousers, her tousled hair and her incomplete make up and our grin on our faces would definitely had left no doubt about the “examination” we performed a minute ago in there.

So, I am already working as a full\-time designer for a retail brand, but I'm like the only designer here, it's a small town and overall I am getting tired of not being around people my age, especially when they are not in design field at all, so I'm looking forward to getting a job in a city nearby, to work at a design agency and do print design.

Problem is that since I have bills and stuff to pay, I can't really afford to go through a period of not making a buck, going through interships. Before I leave this job, I want new job to be lined up, contract signed in writing. I am determined to make this happen, optimistic and been preparing tons to hopefully be a good fit for the new job, but there are not many job offers around. Here are couple of questions which I'd really appreciate if someone could try to answer for me:

1. Is it OK to e\-mail design agencies, asking for a full\-time graphic design position in their company? \(as opposed to only e\-mailing them when they publically announce a job opening\). I briefly considered calling them but figured that it would pressurize them too much and perhaps e\-mail would be less intimidating for introducing myself.
2. Should I send a cover letter in the first e\-mail or only send them my resume attached with the first e\-mail?
3. Is previous job experience in the graphic design field a sufficient substitute for having to go through the intern period? It sounds kinda funny but I'm still worried about this, since I don't have much design agency experience and maybe I need to prove to them I can survive working at an agency \(or maybe not?\).
4. Do you have any tips or advice on how to approach my plan/goal?

Thank you so much in advance :\)  I know precisely what I want \(asking a graphic design agency to consider me for a full\-time graphic design position in their team\) but I am occasionally getting crippled with inaction because I am worried about ""using the wrong approach"" or ""doing it wrong"" and blowing off my chances at getting invited to an interview or getting the job."

Warning: long post ahead! 

It has been an absolute garbage day, week, month, and year. I overcommitted to activities and got my worst GPA yet (my fourth year too so it’s not like I’m new to this...), got a bunch of injuries that screwed up both my lifting and running training (my big stress relievers), definitely was a garbage member of all my organizations, watched a bunch of my close friends graduate &amp; leave while I gotta go for a 5th year, my grandfather (and favorite grandparent) is probably gonna die in the next couple weeks, and to top it off I got dumped by my first love (friend 4 years, dating over 1.5 of those) two days ago. I slept maybe 3 hours Sunday night before my first day at work (kinda far away from friends on campus) , have cried way too much, and I’ve pretty much been force feeding myself little bits of food at a time because I just have no appetite. I almost called it quits on going to the gym, but I sucked it up and went.

It started off meh because the one squat rack was taken for a bit, but it was in use by another powerlifter (super uncommon in this part) and we started chatting because we were both wearing adipowers.  I also ran into an acquaintance from college who I did NOT expect to see in the middle of nowhere. Turns out we both use the same gym and are interns at the same place! 

As for the workout, I killed it. Started at weights 10-20 lbs heavier than the last cycle at the beginning of the year and hit some major PRs: 190 lb deadlift for 4x7, 110 lb bench for an easy 4x7 (could have gone higher), and 155 lb squats 4x7 with a new narrower stance. Plus a post-foot sprain injury PR jog of 0.5 mi in 4:43 min after all the leg work ☺️ To top it off I didn’t look at my phone once for a snapchat, text, or call from the ex.

I know there will probably be more misery ahead, but I can finally see the end of the tunnel. And despite all the crap I will continue hitting the gym and smashing PRs.

I'm back again writing yet another thread :). Today I'm going to be talking about one coin in particular that maybe a few of you have heard about in January. That one coin is Verify (CRED).

**First off, what is Verify (CRED)?**

Verify is a distributed reputation protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a very ambitious project that aims to tackle a key factor in the future of marketplaces which is: the reputation of sellers. I do see a great use case with this coin.

**Now, why are we talking about CRED again?**

Recently, I've been doing plenty of research on many low-caps and micro-caps. But, there is a reason why CRED strikes my eye in particular. It's almost x15-20 from ATH. Moreover, in case you did not know, they have been making very steady progress over the past few months. And, I haven’t seen anyone talking about it in detail.

**What is this ""steady progress""?**

A few weeks ago on their telegram, after an AMA, they announced that they have:

- Hired a new senior developer: Eloy Espinaco, who has 9 years of Ruby on Rails experience (programming software).
- Hired 8 interns (mostly from Stanford): 4 back-end, and 4 front-end.
- Released Verify payments alpha.
- Plan on integrating 3 more banks to verify payment alpha.

Some additional info:

- Their subreddit and telegram are moderately active. 
- Their CEO, Yazin Alirhayim has been featured and interviewed by Forbes a few times. 

Keep in mind this is for a rank 700 (as time of writing), coin.

**The icing on the cake here:**

The reason why I think CRED has a lot of potential, is not only because it is 15-20x from ATH, or the steady developments; but that it was listed on COSS yesterday.

I’m sure many of you have heard the Kucoin listing nightmare CRED has experienced, and that’s probably the reason why it has fallen so much: The exchanges. It has been stuck on IDEX and Token.store for the past few months. However, I think it is entirely possible that because COSS has recently implemented FIAT pairings, and plans on redesigning the UI; is that they can shed light on CRED, and bring more volume to the coin - making it easier for investors to buy it. In addition, COSS is hosting a trading promotion to encourage volume on CRED. The upcoming weeks could be **very** interesting for CRED.

One more thing to note is that they have done almost 0 marketing on their coin, and only a few people actually know about it; besides the people that are already invested. Once some sort of marketing begins, I wouldn’t be surprised for this coin to jump from here. The fundamentals are already there. Let me repeat again that this is a rank 700 coin, in which many other coins around that rank are considered dead projects; with no updates at all, and no community. However, be wary of the liquidity on CRED due to it’s rank. I would recommend only buying a small bag to be cautious.

If you do have any opinions or criticism, please feel free to comment below. I am always open to them. Their subreddit is r/verifyas - so feel free to check them out. Keep in mind that this is a high risk-high reward coin; although I’m sure many of you know that - being subscribed to this subreddit. Also, I am not a financial advisor, just looking to share my thoughts here. 

Cheers!"

**This game takes longer than 90 minutes**

*Hamburger SV is facing relegation from Bundesliga. Again. But how come they went from top club to laughing stock? A search for clues among the failed.*

May of 2009. It’s the 83rd minute of the UEFA cup semi final game between Hamburger SV and Werder Bremen. HSV's 1-2 behind in their home stadium, needing another goal at all cost to still reach the final. Defender Gravgaard wants to pass back to goalkeeper Frank Rost, but the ball's slipping over a paper ball thrown at the pitch by the audience, hits Gravgaard's shin and rolls off the pitch – corner kick Bremen. Up until now, HSV counts as especially strong when it comes to defending set pieces. Not this time. 1-3 – HSV drops out of the competition. The downfall begins, triggered by a paper ball. One could call it tragic.

It's not the only hurtful loss against the rival from the Weser. The rivals meet four times in the span of three weeks. Four times the Hamburgians have to admit defeat. Till now the city of Hamburg dreamt of Champions League, even the championship seemed possible. But it's over: The distance to champion Wolfsburg adds up to 8 points by the end of the season. 8 points!

When searching for reasons why Hamburger SV, launch member of Bundesliga and never relegated, has to fight against going down, again, those weeks of losses nine years ago are the crucial moment. What was started by a paper ball could end in the first relegation. After the loss against Frankfurt on Saturday the club isn’t able to stay in the league by itself anymore. If VfL Wolfsburg, third to last, wouldn’t play as atrocious as they did during the last weeks, nobody in Hamburg would care for the final Bundesliga match days. But there’s hope left. At least a bit. Maybe it's not over yet for HSV.  Maybe it keeps going to the playoff games against the third placed club of 2. Bundesliga. Maybe its fans don’t have to start grieving and ask themselves how the downfall of their formerly so proud club started.

What happened after the paper ball throw nine years ago: The disappointing course of the season and the lost games against rival Bremen leave deep marks, culminating in the split between the successful duo at the top: Bernd Hoffmann and Dietmar Beiersdorfer led the club from Bundesliga's no man's land to the ranks of the best 20 clubs in Europe.

Hoffmann became HSV chairman in 2003. From here on, the club celebrated record revenues with nine digit numbers year in, year out. Hoffmann, formerly selling major sporting events' broadcasting rights for SportFive, isn’t especially tall and has slightly grey hair that became lighter since he took over 15 years ago. On the upside he knows how to present himself rhetorically clear and professional when facing the public. Yet he still starts twitching uncontrollably when the pressure gets too high or the questions become too critical.

**Hamburgian football romantics against investor models**

His style of running HSV after the principles of modern marketing led to opposition by the mighty ultras and fan organisations from the beginning. The fans responsible for the atmosphere in the stands, organised by influential choreographers, view the club as their property. Most of them see themselves as football romantics, talk of loyalty and friendship in regard of their club. They reject the commercialisation of football and fear the influence of outside investors. They arrange for vocal protests when Hoffmann introduces the investor model “kickoff times three” in 2008, which should help facilitating financing new player transfers.

These followers, which can be called HSV extremists without a doubt, want to prevent forfeiting their club’s self-determination. In their club the members should call the shots. Their voice should be worth more than that of an investor, no matter how much money they bring along. The fans, all of them members of the club, organise themselves, become involved in sports politics. At the club’s annual general meeting they suddenly start vocalising voting suggestions and provide representatives to keep a lid on Hoffmann.

The meetings sometimes take till the morning hours and require a lot of stamina. Speakers usually are men with wrinkly faces, crinkles and liver spots, often starting their speeches with a mention of the duration of their memberships, as if it was a sign of competence and wisdom. But there also are ultras in hoodies, screaming into the microphone while being primed and viewing Hoffmann as the enemy who's out to destroy their beautiful football.

Dietmar Beiersdorfer, the other part of the leading duo, is a living legend among fans. As head of sports he's responsible for squad development and the opposite of a cold, calculating businessman. As former footballer people believe his attachment to HSV. The 54 year old is calmer than Hoffmann, who seems hyperactive at times. He speaks quietly and slowly, which seems a bit hypnotic sometimes. Beiersdorfer isn’t an alpha animal, he's far from power hungry, instead he's out for unity and harmony and people feel good at his side. His initial successes when signing new players, among them Rafael Van Der Vaart and Jerome Boateng, and frequently qualifying for Europe add up to optimism. But after Beiersdorfer initiated expensive mishaps, people start questioning the youth system and bigger and more differences occur when it comes to appointing coaches, he falls out with chairman Hoffmann. The leadership breaks apart.

“The main reason for the escalation were the frayed nerves of all people involved after the Werder weeks: Coach Martin Jol's, Didi's, and mine.” Hoffmann said at that time. None of them realised HSV played their most successful season since the European championship in 1983. Instead they argued over failures – and depart in bad blood. Head of sports Beiersdorfer accused his co-worker of exceeding his competences. He called the board for a vote of confidence and lost the power play. His contract gets terminated, he has to go, Hoffmann is allowed to stay.

Hamburger SV has to continue without a strong head of sports from now on. The candidates they want decline them. The board, driven by actionism, presents a strange solution for the vacuum in May 2010. They appoint Bastian Reinhardt, 35 years old, mediocre defender and at that time intern at the public relations department, as new head of sports. The fans lust for someone to identify with, the stands celebrated Reinhardt at his last short appearance in a HSV kit, and the controllers consider him a decent short term solution. Hamburg gets used to those. Former players have to steer the wheel. Men with a HSV past regularly get urged into positions they don't fit into. Many coaches become victim of this unstable constellation. All of them knew HSV worked like a windmill that always crushed them first in case it got stormy. But the conditions at Hamburg were too lucrative to simply decline such a job.

The MBA Hoffmann stays the strong man in the club. He seems overwhelmed with the sheer number of construction areas and political pressure inside the club, but tries to keep up the image of a top club. He uses a trick that already worked a few times to calm the agitated public: He signs Ruud Van Nistelrooy, a world star, from Real Madrid. The move leads to euphoria at short notice, but becomes a problem soon. HSV and its surroundings over time devoted themselves to mechanisms in which it's not important if actions are right as long as they lead to good public relations in the short term.

In the two seasons after Beiersdorfer’s departure Hoffmann still fails to calm the waves inside the club. In March 2011 neoliberal politician Carl-Edgar Jarchow and marketing expert Joachim Hilke replace him, at a time when a new head of sports is already appointed for the next season, with a promised transfer budget of 20 million euros. But Jarchow is forced to disappoint Chelsea's youth coordinator Frank Arnesen. HSV's finances are torn because a lot of future earnings were moved to the present while a lot of spendings were postponed.

The Dane has to make money via transfers instead of being able to invest into a team that's falling apart. For financial reasons HSV has to let go of earned players like Zé Roberto, Frank Rost and Ruud Van Nistelrooy and, thanks to Arnesen’s contacts, replaces them with young talent from London. Forming a team that’s able to compete without any money is a task destined to fail. And one that inevitably leads to the first struggle against relegation in many years. Arnesen gets criticised for his transfer policy and quickly loses reputation. In summer of 2012 he even gets humiliated: Klaus-Michael Kühne, a transportation billionaire who invested part of his fortune into HSV, uses media to force the re-signing of Rafael Van Der Vaart – after Arnesen explicitly spoke out against that transfer.

To get the 29 year old Dutchman back to the city, the club takes a huge financial risk and its debt skyrockets. The board criticises Kühne's meddling, but does nothing to prevent it to not risk the good mood inside the city's borders. The Dutchman brought glamour along. Fans and media ride a wave of joy, and more camera teams and photographers than ever attend public events and training sessions. They finally have a dazzling personality back, a hero promising better times, that's bringing success, at least for one season.

HSV finishes the 2012/13 season on place seven and just marginally misses out on European football. But blinded by the flashlights almost all club representatives fail to see Van Der Vaart aged seven years since he last wore a HSV dress and he also seems to weigh seven kilogrammes more often. It's not the footballer Van Der Vaart making the newspapers, but the husband Van Der Vaart, when rainbow press starts cannibalising his divorce from TV presenter Sylvie, which gets more attention than his declining performances on the pitch.

The club representatives decide on another upheaval after the most successful season in years. Arnesen, strongly weakened anyway, has to leave the club after two years. Unofficial reasoning behind that move: With an annual salary of 1.8 million euros he's too expensive. Decided by the same board offering him that contract in 2011 in the first place. At the next general meeting that decision gets criticised harshly. An initiative named “HSVPlus” gets launched with the goal to outsource the professional team into a PLC to save it from the irrational decisions of a committee now branded as “council of the clueless”. Simple fans stripping off their sack coat to hold five minute speeches in retro kits when trying to get elected into the supervisory board shouldn’t be able to have any influence over the club anymore from now on.

While the reformers, supported by club legends like Horst Hrubesch and Thomas Von Heesen, draw big attention to themselves off the pitch, the team on the pitch, put together by coaches and managers changing every now and then and not even knowing which philosophy their employer wants to stand for, has to fight relegation. Do the representatives view HSV as a European top club going through some bad years, or as a distressed club in urgent need of consolidation? HSV is slithering from one upheaval to the next one, year in, year out. Snootily the club demands virtues like concentration, identification and loyalty by its young talents, but falls short when it comes to showing these virtues itself. Because of this it's no surprise those players aren't able to live up to their full potential and players in Hamburg develop the tendency to get worse rather than better.

But: Who should manage all those things, facing an undemocratic government that fully devoted itself to the financial aid of investor Kühne? The heavily indebted club basically surrendered to its rich patron. Important decisions are no longer in management’s hands, but in Kühne's. HSV starts a heated argument about a fitting legal status and structures in complete disregard of its own football related decline. At the end of 2013/14 it somehow still works out. The Hamburgians hold the league. Thanks to the away goal rule they manage to keep Karlsruhe at bay. A closer scoreline is almost impossible. Afterwards HSV, again, declares a fresh start. This time everything should change, beginning in summer 2014.

The new messiah has a well known face. Dietmar Beiersdorfer becomes the new chairman, despite feeling unfit for that job in the past and unwilling to work with Joachim Hilke, who is known to be a schemer associated with Kühne inside the club.

Who's willing to survive this construct has to stay on good terms with the billionaire from now on. Kühne is supposed to be a supporter and to acquire HSV Football PLC stock, but negotiates the company’s worth from 400 million down to 250 million euros in the middle of transfer season and provides the promised financial aid to the new leadership very late. The 80 year old's love for the club has financial limits and makes a constructive collaboration difficult.

Beiersdorfer, contrary to the rallying cries of the revolutionaries trying to force stable financing and a clever transfer politic, tries to make the team competetive again by spending money, way too much money for HSV's current condition, to stop the constant decline. A plan culminating in the next playoff games after a series of blatant misjudgments, strongly disproving the promises made at the beginning of the season. Beiersdorfer becomes classified as unassertive and not strong enough to be chairman, but is allowed to prove himself for two and a half years because people like his image of a lovable, empathetic and genuine boss. After there’s no doubt left he's overstrained, he’s still forced out.

When the experienced Herbert Bruchhagen becomes Beiersdorfer’s heir in winter 2017, it's already too late to turn things around. Investor Kühne already built an alliance with player agent Volker Struth and affiliated coach Markus Gisdol he can use to abuse HSV's reliance on him. He's able to dictate terms and conditions and to strongarm Bruchhagen, fully knowing the club needs his aid to obtain the license to stay in the league. HSV is too heavily indebted to survive without Kühne's money. If he ceases giving aid, the club has to declare bankruptcy and it will be impossible for the German Football League to grant them the licence. Toothless Bruchhagen is forced to watch Kühne, Struth and Gisdol assembling a squad that ends up crashing down to second tier without brakes. A saviour is needed. Again.

Another known face has to become it. Bernd Hoffmann gets voted president of the club’s amateur department in February 2018. His rise to leadership of the supervisory board makes the members decide on a revolution and a fresh start for the umpteenth time, after the course of the season seems to indicate there’s almost no hope left to hold the league this time. Until Christian Titz takes over the team, a man with next to no experience as a coach on this level of football. At least he’s courageous enough to let HSV play in a way that remotely resembles football. Under him the club acquired 10 points out of the last six games and is nearing the playoff spot. If HSV manages to beat Mönchengladbach next weekend to save themselves to the playoffs it's thanks to Titz. But salvation is still a long way."
8hwvwn,0,2018-05-08,I'm new graduate and I'll be starting a job that pays 200k per year. I have massive expenses and need help with budgeting,Iringi,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8hwvwn/im_new_graduate_and_ill_be_starting_a_job_that/,"A few numbers have been changed to preserve anonymity, but the basic information is the same. 

**Current situation**

I'm 27 and I've been in university for the last 8 years, primarily focusing on my degree, research, and internships. I've financially supported myself through student loans, scholarships, and assistance from family. 


I'm in a medium cost of living area and I have a budget of $2,500 per month.  I live with roommates and my rent is $600. I'm spending approximately $1,900 on other basic expenses such as car, food, entertainment, etc. Other than an emergency fund of 6k, I have no savings. 


My budget allows me to have a decent lifestyle. I'm not struggling to buy food or pay rent, but I cannot spend money on luxuries. My brother is one of my roommates and I pay for some of his expenses such as food, internet, and utilities. I'm able to eat out 1-2 times a week at medium priced restaurants (such as Dennys), go to the pub once a week, and one vacation a year (Christmas). I have an 18 year old car worth roughly $3,000 and a few tech gadgets worth $3,000. 


**Expected earnings and expenditure** 

I'm about to graduate and I have a job that pays around 200k (see below) for my 1st year. My compensation goes down because these are guaranteed earnings and my bonuses for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year will not be decided until I finish my 1st year. These amounts assume that I contribute 18k to my 401k because they will add additional 9k . It's very likely that my compensation will increase by roughly 10-30k every 2 years until I reach 350k to 400k. 


Year | Amount | Notes | After tax income
----|------|-----|----------------
1 | 198k  | Includes 50k signing bonus with first pay check | 127k
2 | 172k | Partial bonus guaranteed | 112k
3 | 157k | No guaranteed bonuses | 102k
4 | 157k | No guaranteed bonuses | 102k




Expense | Amount | Notes
-------|------|-----
Student loans | 162k | Currently at 6.2% interest. When I pay off 25% of my loan, my company will pay any interest over 1% for 5 years. This is assuming that I'm still working at the company.
Family loans | 67k | From my dad and uncle. Both are 2.5% interest to keep up with inflation. There's no rush to pay them off, but I want to be fair and return it as soon as reasonably possible. Over time, I want to give them an additional 100% of my entire loan amount for believing in me and helping me out. They took a big risk and they deserve to share in my success. 
Medical Loans | 25k | I want a surgery which will not be entirely covered by insurance. I've been waiting for 4 years and I'm adamant about undergoing the procedure before starting my job. It will drastically improve my quality of life and Unsure of interest rate. I cannot state the name of the surgery because it will almost uniquely identify me, but you can think of it like a surgery to fix a major body part required for daily function. For example, imagine that I'm unable to lift my left hand above my chest. I could live with it, but it would be a major annoyance and something I want fixed. I wasn't born with it, but acquired it a few years ago and prevents me from doing some activities I enjoy.  
Moving costs | 10k | Moving across the country. Covers air ticket, car transport, 1 week in hotel, shipping my possessions, etc. 
Car | 20k | After working for 2-3 years, I'll want to buy a good used car. I prefer to save money and make a one-time payment
 |  | 
Total | 284k | 

**Financial plan**

I'll be living in high cost of living area similar to New York or Washington DC. I'll have a good healthcare plan with no deductible and maximum out of pocket expenses is 2k. 



Expense | Cost | Notes
-------|----|-----
Rent | 2,000 | If required, I can cut this down to 1,500
Base expenses | 3,000 | Covers food, car, entertainment, etc. If required, I can cut it down to 2,500, but I would have to sacrifice things like vacations or entertainment. Based on my current spending of 1,900 in medium cost of living area
Business expenses | 500 | I'll be working in an industry where public perception is quite important. I'll be expected to wear a thousand dollar suit, eat at fancy restaurants with colleges, etc. I can avoid this, but my career would take a big hit. 500 is on the low side, my friend works at similar company and routine spends over 1k a month
 |  | 
Total | 5500 | 66k per year

I'm putting 27k into 401k every year. I know that this amount is supposed to be pre-tax, but I'll make it post tax to make things a bit simpler (and have some additional savings). Furthermore, it's 27k instead of 18k because I factored my company's contribution into my compensation package. 

After my basic expenses, I'll be left with 34k per year for non-routine expenses. How should I spend this money? What should I pay off first? Should I plan for anticipated compensation increase over the years? Any advice is greatly appreciated! 

** Edit: Why the downvotes? **

Edit: I've changed the wording for my surgery. It was implying that I had the ability to decide based on personal preferences, but the reality is that my quality of life will significantly improve. "

Please ignore errors as I am on my mobile device. 

I have been feeling down lately about my entry into the tech field.

I am currently working as a Software Engineering intern at a trading firm in a major city. 

My experience there hasn't been the best.
I get good feedback on my code, but the environment isn't ideal. I am on an all white male team and there exists a dominant ""bro culture"". I have stories but I don't want this to turn into an extremely long post. 

I have been applying for jobs and I have gotten a few interviews scheduled recently. My first was last week. It was for a company that has an all white male team. 

I proceeded to do the coding challenge and I can tell from their tone, the topics that they brought up that I wouldn't be a good fit at their company. I walked away understanding that the interview did not go well. This week I was notified that I wasnt going to be given an offer. 

Thinking about that interview I can't help but think that preconceived notion bias was be applied to me as soon as I walked into the room.  

I then read articles about how Black female engineers only account for one percent of the total. Also another one stating how most Women enter and leave the field within 5 years. Articles like these contribute to even more discouragement for me.

I know I am junior but I believe myself to be a determined fast learner. I am just really feeling down about choosing this career path currently. I am also left wondering if I will always feel this way. I love coding and I wish I felt like I could be successful in what I love to do.

I wouldn't post this in cscareeradvice because that subreddit is full of white males that will just tell me that ""black people have it easier"" and undermine my experiences that I have as a WOC. 

Anyone who has any tips on navigate ""bro culture"" or anyone who can share their experiences being in a male dominated environment (white male even) please give me your thoughts and advice."

I was diagnosed with type 2 then 1 but I think it’s a big mistake the doctors made…I have never even hit hypomania let alone mania I mean sure I go to the gym at 5am but so what I like it there it’s my sanctuary and it’s not like I’m doing something bad I’m exercising and letting go of some of the energy bent up inside me so it helps but they don’t want me doing it at 5am I have to go some other time but I don’t have another time. I go to bed at 7pm but I don’t fall asleep for 2 hours sometimes I only sleep 4 hours but I wake up fine they just don’t listen to me when I say that. 

I’m on wellbutrin and abilify but I recently stopped my abilify because I was no longer convinced that I’m bipolar. I don’t feel any different in fact I feel the wellbutrin is working even better than it did before like the abilify was holding me back from achieving my potential. I found an internship that I like but the doctor asked if I was up for it….of course I’m up for it. I can workout and go to work and see friends without it being mania so why is everything seen through these lenses?

I told the doctor I’m doing fine and she agreed to not see me for 6 weeks so I’m happy about it because at least they won’t change my meds for 6 weeks and I get to keep taking wellbutrin which single\-handedly pulled me out of depression and is making me feel alive again. I really feel like I’ll get my shit together this time but the doctor and social worker don’t believe me and are thinking it’s a start of hypomania."

8hyfv1,11,2018-05-08,I consider myself far-left-wing,ubuntufig,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/8hyfv1/i_consider_myself_farleftwing/,"I consider myself far-left-wing, anarcho-transhumanist, but very anti-idpol and anti-political correctness. There are almost too many reasons to list as to why I think Social Justice Warriors are full of shit and the whole phenomenon of SJW crybabies influencing the media and popular discourse with their brand of political correctness is complete bullshit, and I'm sure much of this isn't news to any of you, but I’m going to try and be as concise as possible and summarize everything wrong with the crybullies:

It’s a cult. It functions exactly like a cult. You know what other group does the same exact sorts of things? Jehovah’s Witnesses. I was a Jehovah’s Witness for much of my childhood. My upbringing cultivated an extreme abhorrence for religious and magical thinking. I was raised in a cult, but I’m an atheist now. I have a vehement dislike for cults of any kind. The idea that people will be rewarded with a utopia if only they follow a specific dogma prescribed by the cult’s leaders is manipulative and cruel. SJWs are encouraged to cut off and shun people who fail to uphold the tenets of SJWism. Most SJWs who discover that their friends are not also SJWs will freak out on those friends, feed them the dogma, and try to “convert” them, and if those friends refuse, they’ll cut off contact with them. This is literally how cults work.

It’s intrinsically divisive and creates double-standards out of nothing. At the heart of SJWism lies the frothing shit-crock known as identity politics. This is the idea that the identity of a speaker is more important than anything they have to say. It’s hilariously reductionist. Basically, if you’re a member of an oppressed class of people, and you say exactly the same thing as someone who isn’t part of an oppressed class of people on the topic of oppression, what you have to say is automatically more valid, because you have firsthand experience. Objectivity is denigrated, and emotional, subjective responses to claims are encouraged. Under SJW dogma, there is no universal truth, only personal truths. This is both illiberal and contrary to Renaissance values. It takes perfectly good individuals and reduces them to collectives based on their physical and mental attributes. If two people say the sky is blue, it shouldn’t matter what color their skin is, or if they have a dick or a twat, or who they like to fuck. Identity politics is complete nonsense.

Learning about SJW dogma only qualifies you to teach others about SJW dogma. The range of disciplines involved in SJWism have no practical real-world applications. None. If you get a degree in communications, you’re going to go into journalism and preach SJWism. If you become a professor, you’re going to brainwash kids with this bullshit. Nothing about SocJus teaches you how to build a bridge, or man a ship, or run a factory, or engineer electronics, or anything of any actual use. These degrees are fucking easy. People pick them because they’re easier than STEM and make dipshit brainlets feel good about themselves. If you’re such an unremarkable, low-IQ twat that you come out of college with a BA in Communications, you could’ve saved a whole lot of money by going to trade school, and then you’d be making a decent amount of bread as a plumber or electrician instead of flipping burgers while sucking dick to try and get an internship at some online tabloid like the useless fucking sack of shit you are. They’re offended when I say shit like this? Well, I’m offended. I’m offended that I have to breathe the same air as these people. I’m offended that their lungs are molesting innocent oxygen molecules with carbon exchange as we speak.

The whole concept of avoiding PTSD triggers is nonsense. PTSD triggers are not supposed to be avoided. You're supposed to expose yourself to them in a controlled environment to desensitize yourself to them. What it basically amounts to is that they commandeered the language of psychiatry to try and police speech.

They’ve ruined comedy. You can’t joke about anything anymore, because not only do these silly twats lack a sense of humor, they consider even slightly racy humor to be something worth prosecuting people over. Thanks to political correctness, a man who tried teaching a pug how to Heil Hitler was fined hundreds of pounds sterling for obscenity. They actually charge people with crimes for filming harmless pranks in the comfort of their own home. SJWs think that this entirely Orwellian state of affairs is somehow desirable.

They’ve ruined fiction. You can’t write about anything without offending someone. Wanna write a rape scene in your book? Maybe a lynching? That’s insensitive! Your cult-assigned Sensitivity Reader will give you zero stars. See, this is how you know SJWs are full of shit. They’ll say “We live in a rape culture” or “Rape is everywhere!” and cite all these statistics saying one in four women will be a victim of rape sometime in their life, but then turn around and say that you can’t write about it in a fictional context without being really circumspect and evasive about it. Well, if rape is as common as breathing, why can’t we write about it in all its terrible, twisted details? I mean, the whole point of authoring a work of fiction is to comment on reality in some way or another, right? Because, they say. Someone who was raped may pick it up and feel terrible about themselves, and that’s terrible. Someone who likes rape scenes may jerk their gerkin to it, and that’s also terrible. Best not to include it at all, they mutter. Well, you know what? Fuck you! In fact, from now on, any stories I write will have three times as much rape in them, just to spite you motherfuckers! I hope somebody’s triggered. I hope somebody picks up something I wrote and cries great big crocodile tears. You think I give a shit? You think I’m supposed to give one single shit? Fuck you. I want to make you hurt. On purpose. That means I’m doing my job as an author. What, you think you’re supposed to pick up some horror novel, and it isn’t supposed to hurt? That you’re supposed to walk away with warm, fuzzy feelings no matter what literature graces your hands? You wanna reduce all fiction to a bunch of fucking feel-good Hallmark Cards? You want everything to be covered in pillows and cotton candy to shield you from reality? Fuck you. I’m going to find some way to crawl in your head and give you nightmares, and afterward, I’ll sleep like a fucking baby.

They’re ruining eye candy. How come when I boot up Mass Effect: Andromeda, the dude-Ryder looks hot, but if I want to make a female character, she has to have a big, round, creased, pockmarked, tanned face like a fucking baked potato, with a nose that looks like a small potato on a big potato? Because. SJWs, son. Potato. Jesus, you should see the fucking wankstains who developed that game. They all look like potatoes, too. I’m guessing they used themselves for reference.

They’re ruining journalism. How many publications these days invite you to support the same bullshit neoliberal authoritarian-statist status quo? How many publications are even the slightest bit sympathetic to a libertarian or individualist point of view? Or, for that matter, how many are just plain unbiased? NYT, WSJ, Reuters and AP are fine, but god. Outside of that, all you hear are these bullshit fucking opinion pieces. It’s always the same crap. Excoriating decent people or works of fiction for not following SJW dogma. Holding up unremarkable bullshit by minority authors as the second coming of Christ just because it adheres to their traditions. Whining about the latest episode of South Park, or something insensitive that Ricky Gervais said, or a video game character who had a nip slip out of her top, or whatever the fuck it is that's grinding their gears today. It’d be one thing if this sort of shit were a range of niche opinions, but this shit is everywhere. It’s overrepresented in journalism. Too many of these cunts have a platform that unquestioningly accepts them for what they are instead of holding them to a higher standard, which brings me to my next point.

They like to silence dissent. If you want to speak your mind, if you want to tell them why their dogma is unscientific, new-agey nonsense, not only will they not engage you in rational debate, they will insult you, tar-and-feather you, try to get you fired from your job, and try to get you blacklisted from public speaking roles. For all their whining about fascism, they more closely resemble fascists than any other demographic. The people who call themselves fascists are just right-libertarian gilded-age corporatists trying to be outrageous and put their opponents off-balance by projecting an intimidating aura.

They’re just plain fugly. Short hair dyed neon blue, fish mouth, love handles, braces. God, they’re like some kind of Coney Island freak show. I would pay good money to see SJWs wrestle over deep-fried Twinkies.

In conclusion, fuck them. But not literally, because that would be gross as hell and your dick or tongue would come back covered in SJW smeg.

Oh, and there's one other thing. You know what pisses me off the most about it? It's unkind. Brainwashing all these unremarkable dipshits into thinking that they can be a part of something bigger than themselves, if only they start by feeling guilty about literally everything in their lives. That's not something that someone who believes in justice does."

My girlfriend broke up with me because I haven’t had time to see her ( I only see her Saturdays and Thursday mornings before work,  because of Work, school, my internship and practice) and we’ve been together for 5 years but she decided to break it off last week.

She says she still loves me and has romantic feelings for me but she claims her mind is made up, but she still wants to be friends. 

So I’ve been her friend, text her everyday like I used too, but she’s distant and cold, leaves me on seen. And we keep arguing.

I really want her back, she’s my best friend. but I can’t take this shit anymore, So, I guess I’ll start this whole no contact thing and hope for the best.


Any advice before I start? I tried venting on r/relationshipadvice  but they just told me I fucked up and don’t deserve her and that I treated her badly, so my mood is down the shitter. "

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

8hz06o,3,2018-05-08,I [21M] kissed my ex girlfriend who’s married with kids. How do I get over her and stop hanging out with her?,Androex,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/8hz06o/i_21m_kissed_my_ex_girlfriend_whos_married_with/,"EDIT : She’s 26F

I hung out with my ex girlfriend and my female best friend. We went out to eat and we caught up. She discussed her husband and kids. She is contemplating naming her next child after me.

We then went to my dorm and smoked weed. I had an arm around both of them. I also kissed both of them on the cheek and both of them kissed me on the cheek as well. We also got so drunk we ended up passing out in my bed.

I feel so sorry for what happened. I don’t want anything else to happen and  all 3 of us agreed that we drank too much and what happened is inappropriate. I want to cut off my ex girlfriend but we have so much fun playing video games online. 

How do I forget her? Or at least, limit our interactions to texting and online video games? I remember the change she made in my life. She helped me apply for my computer science internship when I was studying computer science, and her husband is looking to offer me a business internship. I do have a fast food job that I got because my ex introduced me to a guy she had a one night stand with.

I understand this is so inappropriate but I really enjoyed our time in person and our time online gaming.

TL;DR: I hung out with my ex and my female best friend, smoked weed, and we passed out after drinking. I also kissed them on the cheek and they kissed me too. What should I do?"

We all use Dropbox to share marquees, resizes for upcoming shows, ect. For a project I needed to use adobe premiere but it wasn’t working because I had not updated my Mac OS. So I updated my OS this morning before work. After it finished, I opened Dropbox to find that every single file was gone. I thought it was just lagging so I waited. Nothing. I went on my web browser and signed into Dropbox hoping that it was just the app not working.. nothing but the folders were there. Every file was gone. At that moment, I realized I may have just ended my internship by updating my OS and deleting everything off Dropbox. After frantically skimming through folders and menus I saw that there was a tab for recently deleted. It was all there. I was able to restore everything back to normal before anyone noticed. I’m still shaking right now. I don’t smoke but this would be a great time for a cigarette and a cup of coffee. 

TL;DR updated my OS and somehow deleted every file in my shared Dropbox folder for work."
8hzlx1,238,2018-05-08,Thought I was better than ya’ll but I’m not [Shitpost],medschool201,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8hzlx1/thought_i_was_better_than_yall_but_im_not_shitpost/,"Guys, I almost made it out of ms3 without being treated like shit by a scrub tech. I’ve been scared of them all year because of the stories you guys tell but was beginning to think that mean scrub techs were just a legend that older med students told to scare the younger ones. 

Here I was thinking I was just so much more self-aware and respectful than all you fuckers because I never got yelled at over dumb shit. Sure they would occasionally remind me to stand back from the table when handing them my gloves or waiting for my gown, totally reasonable request and I always appreciated them watching out for me and the safety of the patient. Once I even managed to touch my face mask with the back of the bovie as I was untangling it while at the same time trying to get in a better position to see what I was about to burn... we had to get an entire new bovie in the middle of a case and the scrub tech and nurse didn’t even act annoyed, they reassurred me and told me it was no big deal. 

Here I was thinking that I was better than you guys because I always made sure to introduce myself, write my name on the stupid board, anxiously anticipate helping transfer the patient, be the first to grab the stupid warm blankets. I thought these things were enough to win over their collective hearts and make it clear to them that I knew what I was doing and was a part of the team... maybe even part of THEIR team. 

My dreams of mutual respect were shattered yesterday. Got my ass handed to be my a scrub tech. Picture this: 5 days left of ms3... no surgical rotations next year. Applying peds so no surgical rotations ever again. Imagine me happily entering the OR (appropriately wearing my cap, mask and shoe covers of course), ready to introduce myself and help prep before the patient arrived. Scrub tech initially ignores me, nice scrub nurse starts chatting with me and offers to grab my gloves. Scrub tech stops ignoring me long enough to tell me that I wouldn’t be scrubbing in because there were already 3 people scrubbing in. Thought it was a little weird she was telling me what to do but I had never worked with this attending whereas she had so figured it was a well known preference of his that 3 is a crowd. Cool, no big deal, honestly I don’t give a shit about scrubbing in. I figured that there was an intern joining that I didn’t know about and I’m happy to watch the lap camera from the back of the room. Turns out that the 3rd person “scrubbing in” to the case was her... the fucking scrub tech lol. 

Patient arrives, attending walks in, he immediately asks why I’m not out scrubbing so I go to grab some gloves for the tech. She legit asks me if I have “scrubbing privileges” at this facility. Lol bitch please. My attending turns around and says she better check if he even has scrubbing privileges at this facility because he’s never heard of such bullshit. 

I scrub, come in prepared to put on my own shit like a grown up but no, she insists on putting on my gown and gloves for me, which is cool I appreciate the help and totally get that she’s never worked with me so has no idea if I know
how to or not. I put my arms out for the gown and she then proceeds to yell at me during every step for not doing it exactly how she wants me to... ok sorry but I’ve scrubbed at 5 different hospitals this year, there are a few different ways you can put on gloves and I’m sorry if I didn’t correctly anticipate yours. 

Oh and I forgot to mention that earlier when I handed her my gloves, she sent me back to get a new pair because she didn’t watch me open the package so she couldn’t be sure they were sterile, even though I was standing right by the table and had the package opened towards her to grab exactly like the scrub nurses do. Also she took them from the plastic package and set them on her fucking sterile table before deciding she didn’t trust them... so the paper package was somehow so contaminated I couldn’t use it while also being sterile enough to leave on your field... k. 

Ok so then I finally get scrubbed in, case is going great, start to forget about this bitch when she suddenly GRABS a tool out of my hand... a tool that the resident handed to me ten seconds earlier and said “hey will you hold this”. Then at one point she put her hand on my shoulder (thought shoulders weren’t sterile?) and walked me backwards like a child who isn’t capable of following oral commands because she needed to hand my resident a tool... I am
not qualified to do much during surgery but I am confident I can pass a fucking object down the table. 

After the case I told her thanks with 0% sarcasm and gave her a 100% genuine smile. I didn’t explain that what I meant was actually “thanks for giving me the opportunity to commiserate with my fellow med students”. Thanks to her I finally feel like I’m a part of this subreddit. I get it guys!!! I get why everyone hates scrub techs. I get all the memes now! She may not want on HER team but she made me a part of THIS team.

8i02yb,1496,2018-05-08,Haole Hattie and how I finally corrupted her golden child.,HawaiianSirenMama,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8i02yb/haole_hattie_and_how_i_finally_corrupted_her/,"It would seem u/cristy888 and I have been coasting off each other when it comes to llama snack feeding time. Her recent story about The Goa’uld reminded me of how much Haole Hattie hates tattoos. And how I corrupted her dear sweet golden child. 

On the day of my 18th birthday, I got my first tattoo. It’s the typical first tattoo, a tribal image in a mostly hidden place unless I’m wearing a bikini. My dad went with me to get it since he has plenty of ink and wanted to be there with me. My mom was *pissed* (the pink dress wearing grizzly made an appearance that day) but her and I now have matching tattoos so everything is forgiven. 

I love my ink. Every piece is special to me, even ones I had done that were maybe not the brightest decisions. It is a part of my story, and I regret nothing. 

Haole Hattie has had some thoughts about my tattoos over the years. Mainly that I’ve ruined my body because of them. I’ll never be able to hold a steady job simply because I have adorned my body with beautiful art (I’m a freelance artist, tattoos are practically a job requirement). But the most egregious thought, brought on by the voices dangling the carrot of hope that DH would break up with me in front of her, is that they would ruin DH’s image at work. So he’d have to pick his career or me. 

Excuse me, I need to go find my what’s. They seem to have rapidly flown away. 

DH sort of fell for this at first. He didn’t want me getting any more visible tattoos after Haole Hattie put this gem of an idea in his head. Oh dear, what would his boss think of him if his wife showed up at a work function with a full sleeve? No doubt that he would not have the respect of his peers if this were the case! His career would be ruined! *eyes roll into oblivion* 

This was his thought until he went out to California for an internship (this all went down in college, by the way) and his mentor had a neck tattoo the size of my fist. DH realized that no one gave a fuck about tattoos in his industry, and his spine finally formed back up into the shiny titanium it had previously been. 

He came back from his internship and said he wanted to get a tattoo. Not just any tattoo, though. He wanted to get a slightly matching one with me. Unique enough that if by some horrible accident we broke up, it would still be a cool piece that you wouldn’t guess matched up with someone else. This is hard to explain, sorry if it’s confusing. 

Anyway, we went and got our tattoos done together and it looks beautiful. He got his in a place that is covered by a shirt, and for about a year he kept it hidden from Haole Hattie. 

Until we went on a trip to the beach with the faaaaamily. And DH took his shirt off without thinking. 

Oh, the screaming. 

“WHAT IS THAT?!”

“WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL BODY?!” (Excuse me while i got puke). 

“HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?!”

“THIS IS ALL SIREN’S FAULT!” (Because she’d seen my matching one and made the connection. Or she’s not that smart and everything is my fault because devil vagina magic). 

And on and on until she finally went to sob into her pillow like a 13 year old girl who found out her favorite boy band was breaking up. 

When she came back out, she told me she’d never forgive me for “corrupting her son into ruining his body.” 

“Of course not. It isn’t like your son has any free will to make a decision regarding his body. I’ve taken that all away.” 

DH laughed and reminded his mom that it was his body, and he was an adult. He could do with it what he pleased. 

So Haole Hattie had a Jocasta moment and said “But I *made* that body! It was perfect until you did this!” (Anyone got a bucket I can violently puke in?)

DH told her how gross that was, FIL agreed, and even BIL made a disgusted face. HH CBFed and went to hide until she figured no one would mock her for what she said. Spoiler, she’s still mocked about it because she visibly winces when she sees any of DH’s tattoos. He now has several. 

Good times are always had when Haole Hattie makes an ass of herself.

8i0rdb,1,2018-05-08,So confused... what to do about my mom?,2020choice,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8i0rdb/so_confused_what_to_do_about_my_mom/,"Ok so this is going to be kind of a long, maybe incoherent or stream of consciousness post, sorry about that in advance haha

I guess my question is, what do I do when my mom is narcissistic, bipolar, and has multiples sclerosis at the same time. I don't know what part of her actions come from bipolar, what part from her narcissism, and the fact that she has increasing trouble doing basic things such as walking or driving make the thought of cutting her off, even if that is necessary to keep my sanity, so horrible. If she was ""just"" narcissistic, I would have gone NC a long time ago, but I don't know what to do in my case.

My mom had a really hard life growing up. She had to stay back in her family's origin country while everyone else immigrated to the USA because she had \*just\* missed the green card age requirement \(she turned 22 before the green cards were issued\). She finally, after tons of hardship made it here and then met my dad, married him, and moved to Europe with him. My dad was incredibly emotionally abusive to her and the stories I hear about what he put her through are just gutwrenching. She was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder and multiples sclerosis \(I think the intense stress my dad put her through played a large part\).

Back when I was a kid, she was just like other moms, but slowly, things just started deteriorating, especially as her bipolar intensified \(she refuses any sort of therapy or treatment\). When things got really bad, she would just be incredibly angry and depressed for months on end, and then all of a sudden everything would be good again. Recently she's been much more rapidly changing moods, where one day she is super scary, and the next she shows up with the biggest smile in the world. On top of all of this, I recently realized that she meets most of the criteria of a narcissist.

I didn't realize just how much of an impact all this had on my life until a few months ago. I went off to college and regularly kept in contact with her. Over the phone \(especially when you're an ocean away\- Im studying in the USA she is in Europe\) she is actually pretty manageable and often, dare I say, enjoyable to talk to. I returned to visit this semester \(I decided to take the semester off to spend time in Europe again and return for the fall instead\) and that's when things got really bad. Ever since I had left, she had become much worse than she used to be. Her MS had gotten worse, but her narcissism also really started showing \(it was always there, but now it just seemed like someone turned it up by a magnitude of 10\). Whether it was only talking about herself, expecting everything of me and my sister while not giving a single shit in return, making us do all her errands for her, constantly talking about how miserable her life is, one time even hinting at her committing suicide to get my sister to drop vacation plans with her dad to do something with her instead... you guys get the idea.

I'm a pretty anxious person myself \(my sister, thankfully, is a naturally happy and easy\-going person\) but I generally manage to stay positive and optimistic. When I returned to visit my family this semester, I was filled with confidence and optimism \(a first in my life as I had just finished an awesome internship in DC\). Then, my mom lost her job, and started coming over to our house every day to ""spend time with us"" \(aka. us keeping her entertained and happy at all times\). She started literally making me and my sister mentally and physically sick. It kind of felt like a dementor \(from harry potter\) had come into our lives. All the happiness and optimism just disappeared into a pit of despair, drama, unhappiness, and yelling. She would come over, and a day that had started on a totally normal foot \(my sister comes home from school, I ask her how her day went, we make food, go off and do our own things, etc.\) would turn into an unpredictable narc\-fest. Sometimes she would scream\-cry at my sister about why she never visits her \(she never visits her because my mom treats her like her personal butler and doesn't respect her boundaries\), sometimes she would scream at me telling me that all her life problems are my fault, and if we so much as dared to have other plans, she would throw a temper tantrum until we would hop into her car to do her grocery shopping or some other errand for her.

The question is, what do I do?? The thought of cutting her off just sets off pictures in my head of my poor, innocent mom who has had a horribly unfair life \(a lot of it due to my dad\), a woman who sees herself slowly losing the ability to do basic things like walk and type because of MS, a woman who, while horrible when she's in one of her bad phases, is perfectly fine to be around when she is doing well \(which can go on for months at a time\), and a woman who has lost everything \(some of it because of my abusive dad and the way her life worked out, some of it her fault\). If I let her go, her MS will continue to get worse and I won't be there to help her. I don't see how her life ends in a positive way, especially if she ends up isolated from everybody. I see images of my mom from when she was a child and happy and it just feels like massive pit of sadness takes over, like what did she do to deserve such a tragic life. I also genuinely dont know how much of this behavior comes from bipolar, which she refuses and treatment for, especially because sometimes she goes through weeks\-long phases where she it totally fine to be around and her narc behavior just gets dialed down a lot. I remember how sometimes \(in my past\) she would go for months, being a totally ok person to be around.

But then, I also see a woman who has managed to somehow ruin every special moment in my life either due to her selfishness \(making it about her\) or because of her bipolar \(something she cant really control\), a woman, who, when her facial expression so much as changes in the wrong way, triggers me in a way that nothing else can \(C\-PTSD\), a woman who, if she had her way, would probably turn me and my sister into her permanent slaves existing on this earth only to please her and to keep her company, a woman who regularly comes over and terrorizes my sister with yelling, crying, and threats to make her do things for her, a woman who literally makes me mentally and physically sick when she is in one of her bad phases \(which have been happening so much more often now\).

The question is, what do I do?? I went no contact for a few weeks and it was amazing. When she was coming over every day, I literally had so much anxiety I couldn't sleep at night, I lost all appetite, I was literally shaking from nervousness and guilt. A few weeks of no contact from her and I went back to being totally normal and fine. This sounds super selfish, I know, but for both me and my sister its like theres so much to be happy and optimistic about in life and its almost like our mom snuffs all of this happiness out. But then I think, ""I cant abandon her, she is my mom, she needs help, her bipolar isnt her fault, her MS is getting worse"". What if her narcissism or sadness stems from the fact that her health condition is worsening? She recently told my sister to tell me that she had almost died over the past few weeks while I wasnt in contact with her. And what if when she starts her new job, she goes back to being normal? I'm just so confused"

8i2gpy,4,2018-05-08,Boyfriend left me after I was raped and I am completely broken,noneinnoniie,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8i2gpy/boyfriend_left_me_after_i_was_raped_and_i_am/,"My boyfriend of 7ish months broke up with me recently. This is the story.

We met in June of 2017, and started officially dating in September of that same year. It was a long distance relationship, but everything was good. When we initially met, we spent so much time together\-almost every day. He met my family, my family’s friends, and my friends from back home \(as I just graduated from undergrad and still lived in the college town and he had an internship there\).

He went back to his home country in Asia in July but we kept in contact and were basically in a relationship but just did not have the title. After it was “facebook official” he came to visit me for some time before he started his new job. For New Year’s I went to visit him, and I met his family and friends. Eventually we talked about marriage and kids, and it was something we both wanted. He told me he wanted to marry me as soon as possible. He told his extended family this as well. He even wanted to talk to his mom about marrying me.

I deeply loved him, and I thought he felt the same way. He told me he loved me more than any of his ex\-girlfriends. If we had a problem, we would always try to solve it and when we did fight it would always be resolved quickly. Our relationship was really amazing. I loved him dearly. I flew over the Pacific to see him, and I have an insane fear of flying.

In February, he bought me tickets to go to see him for my spring break in March. In late February, I had a friend rape me and I told my boyfriend about it right away, but he was mad at me. I did not go to the cops, I told my boyfriend that I did not want to ruin this guys life\-because he did not ruin mine. I also really doubt there would be a conviction anyway. There were other reasons too\-but he never tried to understand. At the same time, two of my close friends dropped me and no longer wanted to be friends. I was tremendously emotional.

He could not understand. He told me it broke his heart and our relationship. He barely talked to me and would hardly ever reply. He broke up with me soon after. He said we are too different, and that there are too many obstacles. There was not. I put in so much effort to because he had more traditional values and I did not, but I was willing to change my behaviors for him. Sometimes I did not know what he did not like and what was okay, and he would get mad instead of explaining\-but we always made up soon after. He told me not to come and that he could not bear to face me.

We casually talked but he did not seem to care about me much at all. Around April he stopped replying to me all together. I had moved the tickets to May first, so I decided to go and talk to him in person. I went to the town he lived in and told him repeatedly that I was there and I wanted to see him. I thought he could at least do that but no response and then he blocked me.

The next day I went to his apartment to try to talk \(which is know is crazy but I do not care\-he never explained anything\). I waited for hours, eventually gave up, and left one of his belongings with a note. He messaged me back saying that he has a new girlfriend and a new life. I spend the next few days crying and could not eat.

I think he started dating her in April, which is a month after we broke up. How can someone move on fast? How can you tell your family, others, and me that you want to marry me? How can you tell me that I make your life complete?

I cannot comprehend how this happened. He never explained anything; he just got mad and stopped talking to me. Maybe if he explained, I would have changed my mind and I would have done something about the situation. I really feel betrayed by the person I loved the most.

Any ideas on what could have been going through his head? Or why he did this?

tldr: Long distance relationship ended because I was raped"

To make a long story short I will leave my personal story out of this question.

Basically I used my life savings a couple of years ago to enrol on a 16 week boot camp in London. I had an extremely stressful job before so it was something that I needed to do.

Apart from a 6 month internship working with IOS development I have not been able to secure a position.

I can honestly say that I do enjoy IOS development and would love a junior job in it. But the camp I did, did not involve IOS.

I have been to IOS meet ups in London, I have done a few tech tests some with success, but I am not getting any success with employment.

I am a 32 year old male, and believe this is what might be holding me back?

Everyone else who did the bootcamp managed to secure a position pretty much straight away. I did not.

I have looked at more education but tbh it seems as if I may be wasting money as a lot of the basic things they go through I already know. And after my experience with the last boot camp I’m not sure spending more money on a potentially fruitless career is a good idea.

I get the impression that the software development industry has a lot of gatekeepers in it that do not want to invest in new talent.

I also recently got my SIA licence to be a security guard. My thinking was that I could do nights etc as a guard whilst working on my IOS work. However, I keep getting rejected for security job roles. Or even worse through the major online recruitment companies, Indeed, monster etc. No one gets back ever!!

Does anyone have any ideas? Every avenue I have tried leaves me feeling pretty worthless."

First and foremost I would like to tell you how much I love you and how much you have meant to me for the past two years. When we first met, I was in a rough spot trying to put on a smiling face at a party even though I had been struggling to stay afloat with school, friends, and my future. As we grew closer and began spending more time together, I gradually realized that, out of a random encounter at a party, I had become one of the luckiest people by getting to hang out with such an outgoing, smart, and giggly girl. I’ll admit, I was extremely nervous about us when we first started hanging out - what would happen if I moved, is this something real, are we serious about this - but I continued to pursue it until one day, after graduation, college life just ended. When you left for your internship, I wasn’t sure when I would see you again. 

When you came back, I was so excited to meet you for breakfast, even though it was so close to my move date for school. But when I moved here you were my rock when I thought things were getting tough. Your support and assurance made me feel so special because someone who wasn’t obligated to believe in me actually did. Then I began drowning. Drowning in what I felt was a large sea of faces with no friends and no land for me to enjoy life on within sight. Drowning in endless work followed by endless errands and moves. Drowning in loneliness. I felt those feelings and couldn’t cope with them and so I did what I do too often: hunker down and cut off the world. You came here right in the thick of it, but I worked tirelessly that week to make sure that all of the time I could spend with you was spent with you, not on work. I knew we had been talking like we were back in a relationship, but as my head started going under I needed to pull myself back up and I knew I couldn’t provide you with what you needed, so I asked for a separation. 

That killed me. Seeing you cry for the first time. I don’t think I ever felt quite that way before... the feeling of breaking someone’s heart. In the following months I tried to fill the void you left with other people - some who stuck around, many more who didn’t - but they all missed some special connection I felt with you. And so they faded out.

I didn’t know what to expect when you moved here. I didn’t know where we would go, whether we would be in a relationship, whether you even wanted to see me. I’m so happy I’ve got to experience a new place with you... both of us as new people. I can’t even begin to describe how many smiles you have brought me and how many times you picked me up when I’ve been down. I’ve loved you and only you the whole time and all of the things we’ve done, from Indian food til we drop, to furniture shopping, to food shopping, cooking, and so much more. 

But it’s been the times that you’ve kicked me while I’m down that wore on me the most. I’ve cried so many times in private just trying to deal with a rough weekend with you and I don’t tell you because sometimes I’m afraid of you. You’ve insulted me by criticizing the way I live and the people I spend my time with. Even when we hang out with people you like and care about, I do things wrong. It almost feels like there is no right. I can tell you how beautiful you are, but you don’t believe it and when I smile at you you think something is up. Hell, when I just listen to you with my normal face, I’m in trouble. And most of our arguments have been about some made up fantasy coup d’état against you... that doesn’t exist. I’ve nearly destroyed relationships that helped me through the tough times you are experiencing just because you were too selfish to meet people or just actually listen to me. Beyond the scope of personal problems, I’ve absorbed all of the blows against me for not supporting your career, being too supportive in your career, and listening to minute problems that somehow become my problem. Even the weather is somehow my problem. It feels like every day is a problem, honestly. However, while my complaints here and there are temporary, yours do not lighten up and so I begin feeling drowned again. I’ve tried adjusting my lifestyle just to make you feel better, but I don’t feel that you have even made the effort to realize how far we’ve come. I’ve tried so hard but there is no definite improvement and all the while you’ve begun devolving into a bully for me. My mind goes through cycles that resonate with your mood and I’m just honestly tired of feeling like shit about being me. And while it affecting my life on a small scale is okay for short periods of time, episodes that start midday and last into the night which involve anywhere from a  “fuck you” to “I’m going to kill myself” are just not acceptable. Even when I ask for you to find help and I take it upon myself to find the help for you, you come back to me with excuses for you won’t go back.

It’s hard to love someone that loves to hate you. I can’t tell if you actively seek out the drama that gets started or it comes naturally, but it feels like you just set me up to walk out on me... 

And so, I need to put a pause on our adventures. Not a definite end, but a pause. We are both living here together and I can’t fathom a weekend without you, but certainly some time needs to be spent separate from each other so that we can figure out what we want. I want you to really think about if you want to be in a relationship with me. Is this something that you want, or find convenient? I’ve put enough effort in to prove it’s something I want, but every week you tell me that you’re leaving for something I’ve done wrong again.

There’s too much to say here, but this needs to serve as the start. 

I love you,

8i2qdk,1,2018-05-08,Is online dating for someone who has never dated?,naughty_account_999,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8i2qdk/is_online_dating_for_someone_who_has_never_dated/,"Hello,

I [22M] am about to enter my last year of university. I have good grades, good job prospects, am as social as I would like to be and get along with people (of both genders) just fine. I am not a neckbeard hermit.

That said, I have never come close to dating anyone in my life or done anything sexual at all - this makes me very sad from time-to-time. Although I don't have many close friends (and all of them are male), I have had some female friends over the past few years. However, I don't think I could ever ask out a female friend of mine - and not just due to 'fear of rejection'. Whenever I feel attracted to a female friend I feel dirty and disrespectful. I am not looking for a ltr at the moment and the thought of asking someone out (let alone a friend) with the intention of having a short-term sexual 'thing' feels wrong for some reason (even though that is what I want - if I'm honest). Moreover, I feel a failed ask would tarnish a valued platonic relationship, hurt my friend group, and generally lead to more negative than anything.

My experience this past year (as I have been working in an internship position) has made me feel worse (an major influence on me asking the upcoming questions). I can only imagine the number of single-willing women I encounter to decrease once I leave university. I suppose I already know this was the case, but for the past year (as an intern in tech) I realized I have not even spoken to a woman my age since I arrived. It makes me feel like I wasted my highschool and college time, because once I hit the workforce I'll be stuck dating the few people who cross my path.

Although I am hesitant, online dating seems like a good place for me to start. I would not feel bad pursuing an online date, because that was the understood intention from the beginning and there are (presumably) plenty of single people on these sites, right? **I feel like I need relationship/sexual experience (I have none), but have hangups asking friends out. My window for physical dating is closing - is online dating good as an introduction to dating for someone who has never come close to going on a real date?**

Additional question:
Is online dating safe for someone who is clueless when it comes to dating and when it comes to std's? I was thinking of asking any potential partner to get tested with me, but i feel that this could run counter to the general online-dating culture. Thoughts?"
8i2t7p,1,2018-05-08,Chinese girl stars dating white guy at 16 yrs old. Retard story.,fullasian,PatheticStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatheticStories/comments/8i2t7p/chinese_girl_stars_dating_white_guy_at_16_yrs_old/,"My BF and I have dated for 4 years (since the summer of our junior year til now), and we both go to different colleges in the same city. [Sorry this is a bit long...]

BG: He grew up never really being allowed to hang out after school. His mom would always make him go home to watch his younger brother, or she'd always be obsessed with where he was to make sure he wasn't doing drugs or anything ""bad"". So he doesn't hang out with friends often and is socially awkward. He's white and I'm Chinese- and his mom in particular didn't really like the idea of him dating anyone that wasn't white at the time (she's changed now). Basically, he tries really hard to keep things from his parents because he feels as though his family only meddles with his life. He's the kind that wants to move away ASAP.

The problem is that he's always had a lot of female friends around him (I think girls just find him easy to talk to). Throughout high school, he had this one best friend (let's call her F), and she was extremely outgoing and flirty (she was a drama major). But because he was oblivious, he'd always talk back sarcastically to joke with her and to anyone else, it looked a lot like flirting. When I confronted him about it, he said that wasn't the case and that they were just ""talking like third graders"". But one time, F posted a status saying that she had been with my BF at a mall and at Starbucks. I was pretty shocked since I thought they didn't talk as often- instead he hung out with her (he doesn't hang out much since his mom doesn't let him) without telling me and thought I wouldn't know. F, however, is always spilling everything on her social media accounts, so of course mutual friends I had let me know. He told me later on that it was a misunderstanding and that he had been with family at the Starbucks when they bumped into one another since they live in the same borough (in NYC).

Thing is, if there hadn't been anything going on on the side, then it wouldn't have hurt to let me know? But then a year later, I had bought comic con tickets for him to surprise him and ask him to go with me. Little did I know she bought tickets too and asked him a day before I did, so he was like ""Oh I'm sorry she asked me first"". Which doesn't really make sense since I'M the girlfriend, not F...But he ended up spending more time with me at comic con after hanging out with her group, so I didn't complain. But the NEXT year, she did it again, buying tickets and asking him to go with her. Worse, he told me that they had all planned to go half-naked and cosplay as Avatar the last Airbender characters (there's an episode where they're all at the beach). I really did not feel comfortable with it, and upset since I got tickets as well and he said again that she asked first. He ended up not going with them because he saw that it made me sad. To be fair, he's the kind of guy to give in to things easily because of his self-esteem and personality (which is another reason why I'm always afraid he'll just cheat on me).

Overtime I tried get over it since she ended up getting a GF during our first year of college and really did let me know that she only saw him as a close friend. She eventually went to study abroad and came back, but didn't approach my BF as much as she used to.

We've broken up and gotten back together 7-8 times the past few years- the most recent was about a month ago. He has a work study job at school (for BG, he does Comp Sci, and I do Comp Animation). He told me that he felt like we were becoming more and more incompatible with one another over time since we didn't have as many of the same interests in music or that we were not in the same major (like wtf?). He also said that he had gotten interested in another girl at work for 2 days, and that he had a tiny crush on her. I felt so shocked and awful- because it was partially what I had always been afraid of, that like, he would find another girl that he liked while we were still dating. He went and asked her to be a part of his thesis group, and also started to walk home with her after work. He also got her number and actively texts her about music interests (which he constantly told me about how they have the same music taste). To make things worse, she was the only student that got an internship at FB this year, so it made her even more attractive to people in his major since there's the stereotype that most girls don't code. I'm also not in computer science, and no I've never had an internship at FB, so it kinda makes me look less appealing in that sense. At least he told me about her and asked to break it off then.

But see, every time he asks to break up, it's usually because he doesn't communicate how he feels for a long time. He tends to bottle things up, which also partially causes me to be afraid to trust him sometimes because I don't know what he's thinking. We decided to get back together two days after we ""broke up"", because we felt like we could give it another chance. But the question that he had asked was: ""If we got back together, what would change? I'm afraid that you won't be able to trust me in the long run. I'm also not sure if I want to only date one girl my whole life. A part of me is going to be afraid of what I'm missing out on. What if there's someone more compatible you know?""

And that's what I'm constantly dealing with. I don't know if he's planning anything or if he's always going to be checking out other girls. He's my first boyfriend, and I'm his second GF, so I don't have much ""Experience"". I always felt like I really loved him enough to do anything for him.

At first, I thought of it this way, I can go up and meet the girl and become friends with her. That way she'd know he's taken and that he's not available. But he deliberately hid her from me- he made sure that she left before he came down to meet me so that I wouldn't get to know her. It seemed as though he was constantly trying to save any chance he would possibly have of getting with her in the future- like a Plan B.

I finally confronted him about it and was like, ""Why are you always hiding me from your friends?"" He denied that he was doing so, and that he was just socially awkward about it. He had also seen other coworkers and made sure to have us walk behind them so that they wouldn't see me. And his answer at the time was, ""OMG, they always see me walk with the other girl so it's good they didn't see you."" To me, that didn't make any sense. If there wasn't anything going on between them, then why was he hiding me? His excuse was that he had left much earlier as well so he didn't want them to be like ""Wtf, you left earlier, why are you still here?"". He told me later on that he did let her know that he had to meet up with his girlfriend, so that she left first. But I don't really know if I can trust that he ever did that. Because a part of me also thinks that he only told me that to get me to stop asking. A part of me feels as though he just doesn't want me to get to know her anyway. I still don't know if he's gotten over her since he hasn't given me the reassurance other than ""Crushes flare up and flare down within a number of days. I can just get over her"". But if that was the case, then why did he not just introduce me to her? And not to mention, it turns out that she was one of my close friend from middle school's close friends. It's a small world since my middle school friend goes to the same college as they do. My friend told me that she is extremely work oriented, and isn't interested in having a relationship with anyone, especially not with someone who's taken or with someone who'd like someone while dating someone else. She apparently also liked to stay away from causing trouble for other people. Either way it's unavoidable that I'd get to know her sooner or later, but it seems as though he's denying it.

Two days ago, I went to meet up with him after class. And one of his coworkers saw us holding hands in the train station. Yesterday when he went to work, his coworker actively teased him about having a ""girl"". Today, he told me that the guy knows that he has a GF, but doesn't know my name. I felt a little bothered by it- it seemed as though he was still hiding me in any effort to make sure that the girl in the office wouldn't know. I'm really worried that maybe he has a plan to just break up with me again in the future so that he can still keep her in check in case he needs a back-up plan.

I guess what i don't know how to do, is how to trust him again. I try really hard to, but sometimes I just don't understand. He seems to constantly hide me from his coworkers. And I don't know when he's really telling me how he feels or if he's just paying me lip service. And I'm having trouble not being jealous sometimes because I'm afraid he'll be texting other girls to try to get them interested in him as well.

TLDR: I'm having trust issues with my BF of 4 years because of jealousy as well as him having a tiny crush on a girl at work.

Sure, our habits and way of  life may be confusing to the older generation. I've always wondered how  university students thought about snapchat, I just completed my first  year of med school and last week I finally had the will to delete  snapchat. Everyone my age has it and still surprisingly pull through the  marks. I've been holding 10 streaks with my close friends, crushes, and  interntional friends \(don't live here\). This app had been my life for 5  years. When the best friends list was up and everyone worked hard to  snapchat that crush or best friend to show up on their list. All the way  to now, keeping the longest snapchat streak, opening snapchat everyday.

Our  generation luckily isn't the one that sends blank screens to each  other. People hate that, you have to continue a conversation. But god,  does it waste so much time, and stress you out every single day. I got  sick of people, I normally would never get sick of. Crushes I use to  like, \(yes med students\) would never have the times to make plans with  me in real life and I wonder, is this how I want to live? I've got to  stop using this app at some point right?

I might be just asking this so I get comfort that I did the right thing deleting my snapchat streaks, mild fomo, while I should be focusing on my internship. Is everyone scared that ending streaks means that the crush or distant friend won't talk to them anymore? \(Best friends never die\) FOMO?  Is the streak actually pure fun and sending faces everyday/ messages  the new way to communicate? Facebook messenger isn't the best, but it  does win at productivity still. Sorry, these questions may be trivial.

Interestingly  enough, my friends made efforts to text me and facetime me more often.  It filtered out the extra friends, where they didn't reply to my texts  or crushes that only enjoyed keeping a long streak with me.

Btw, in blunt terms, I'm not an introvert. I'm an extrovert, who feeds off the energy of a room and will not rest till I learn how to help and one day cure people.

TLDR;  I've used snapchat when it first started. Deleted it now because the  streaks are wasting time. What's making you stay or leave the app?"

I have already got in touch with the career adviser for the accounting department and he has been super helpful with any questions that I have had. The biggest thing that he told me was that firms want you to have a good gpa \(4.0 at a community college for 4 semester, aim to keep it around a 3.7 \- 3.8 at the uni\) but they also want to you to be well rounded. Now ill be working part time around 30 hours per week and the only days ill get off are the days I have classes which are two days since i bulked all my classes together like that.

One of those days does include an accounting club meeting. Now I dont really want to run for an officer position as I will be commuting and I dont think I could handle all that responsibility but I do plan on going to all of their recruiting events and just applying for every internship i see, even thought he adviser said that I probably wont be doing one until graduate year since the firms want their interns to either have 150 credit hours or be on the track to get them.  Other than that Ill really be spending my free time either studying, going to school, or working.

My ultimate question is this: will working part time, attending networking events and being semi active in the accounting club, have a good gpa, and just being diligent in applying do i stand a good chance of being a good candidate for internships? Or should i pick up more extra outside activities. "

I have already bought a grill and have tested out many recipes as well as started making my own tare but I feel there is still much to learn.

What I'm basically looking for now is someone who operates a yakitori place in Tokyo (I lost my heart to that city) and would let me intern for a week or so during the first week of April 2019 (which is the only time I can take off from work).

If you know such a person or have any information that would heb me reach my goal I would be much appreciative :). "

Dedicated GPU. Somethig like a GT 940M or MX150 (if I can get that in this budget)


8gb RAM


Not too bulky. I would really love a metal finish but I'll take whatever I can get in this range.


A good battery life is very important since I also plan on doing internships so college in the morning and internship in the evening. 5-7hours of battery life would be nice.


I know I could get a 1050 if I increased my budget a little bit but I don't plan on buying a gaming laptop. I'm saving money to build a Ryzen PC in the following year so I just need this laptop to satisfy my gaming needs during this time.

I mainly play CS:GO, PUBG and once in a while some AAA title.

8i4t0h,0,2018-05-09,Bitcoin is in danger,galan77,CryptoMarkets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/8i4t0h/bitcoin_is_in_danger/,"I have been seeing loads of comments recently about how PoW is so decentralized. This is completely wrong. Please don't believe this.

Currently, Bitcoin is under a huge risk for a 51&amp;#37; attack at no cost. The only factor currently still protecting Bitcoin is a social one. This is zero security in computer security. This is what they hammer into your brain at university for months.

In order to attack Bitcoin, it only needs one malicious intern with some skill to take over Bitmain \(since Bitmain is already in control of 51&amp;#37; of the hashing power [https://twitter.com/cryptoble/status/983455105675595778](https://twitter.com/cryptoble/status/983455105675595778)\)  for a short amount of time and launch a 51&amp;#37; attack, be through social engineering, blackmail, coercion, hacking. We don't know how many times this has been attempted, probably several times already and it failed due to luck. The only variable protecting Bitcoin right now is a social one. This is zero security in computer security!!

If that happens, this would probably also crash the market if that happens, because people will notice how vulnerable BTC is . Then there would be a BTC classic and a BTC, just like it happened with Eth.

Furthermore, you only need 1 mining pool to launch an attack with a 66&amp;#37; success rate approximately.

# How to fix this

I'm not trying to spread FUD, but it needs to be said that PoW is extremely centralized and dangerous in its current design right now.

If PoW wants to become competitive with the new algorithms, PoS/PoW hybrids and the like, they need to do the following 3 things

1. Large mining pools need to be forbidden and restricted to a size of 5&amp;#37; maximum of the entire hash rate
2. Bitmain needs to be forbidden to continue business as usual. Bitmain is a cartel that holds control of the entire Bitcoin block chain. Their only interest is money and selling their ASICs, which adds further to centralization.
3. If Bitmain wants to stay in business and show that they actually care about the security of Bitcoin, they should tell miners mine to stay away from their pools  and move somewhere else if their pool exceed 5&amp;#37; hashing power.

I can't believe that there hasn't been more motivation behind fixing this issue and pointing this out yet. This is such a huge single point of failure and a successful 51&amp;#37; attack on Bitcoin can crash the whole market again, even further down as in February, even if Bitcoin core doesn't acknowledge the fork, new investors will be scared away."

As the title states, I'm a 2w1 (male) with a love interest that is a 3w2.

A little about my situation:

I recently broke up with a girl that I've been with for the past 5 years, because the relationship hadn't worked our for a very long time. We have a daughter together, which further enforced the ""fight to the end"" mindset of mine. My feelings for my ex has been reduced to *friendly* love, and I never found my way back to her, despite living together. So it was time to move on.

This has resulted in a lot of things: I am now searching for my own place, I am attending school, trying to find an internship, trying to see my daughter as often as possible, and in general have a lot on my plate, which is pretty stressful by itself.

And then, out of the blue comes this 3w2 girl, who lives in another city. At first it was just friendship between us, but as time passed, my feelings for her grew and evolved, and so did hers.

Safe to say, we started dating, and has become romantically involved, but nothing official yet. And I am truly enjoying her company. She is both sweet, kind, and very considerate. A lovely girl indeed. 

But here's the problem (which I'm afraid is mostly on me): the old two-patterns becomes more and more clear, when we're *apart*. She works a lot, and she has a lot of activities going for her, which is healthy for her. But meanwhile, I can feel these 8-patterns lurking underneath my skin.

I consider myself a well-balanced 2w1, having known about and used the Enneagram actively for more than 6 years. But as soon as I fall in love with someone, the balance I cling to shifts, and it gets harder to stay focused. 

I don't want to scare this girl away, degrade into manipulative motives, become too demanding of her emotionally, or break it off between us, simply because I've lost my cool, and cannot safely navigate. But I feel that I'm tilting here, and I can't seem to get a hold to myself. I'm aware of my own needs, and I know what I want in my life. 

So... it's very hard for me to stay in control. And I don't want to degrade into an unhealthy Two. I've come a long way, and gained so much experience, learned to trust my own instincts, to love myself, and to tend to my own needs, regardless of how selfish they might seem.

Any Advice?"

Backstory: While in college I held an internship for another government contractor. I filled out the SF-86 honestly and at the time I had not engaged in ANY illigal activities. Fast forward a couple of months, I get my internim secret clearance and then leave the company for other reasons.

Several months later I stupidly have a lapse in judgement and smoke marijuana one time with an ex-girlfriend's friend. (Did not have the security clearance intern ship at this time ~11/2016 )

I intend to fully disclose all my wrongdoings once again on the SF-86. Did I just screw myself accepting a job I may not get a clearance for?""

# An Open Letter to CPP About Fall 2018 Registration + Petition to solve these issues

I am going to send this to CPP Admin and Pres. Coley but to get any attention, **I need your help** If you agree to this, please comment below and add your name to the shared google form so that CPP sees that this isn’t just one student’s cry for help. We shouldn’t have to go through the absolute horror that we all are facing these past few weeks. And they should know that. BRONCOS UNITE!

[Sign the form and to show CPP that this is a problem HERE](https://goo.gl/forms/tYhJGXiRG37dp8Cq1)

**As of now we have 36 people on the petition. Please share on all your social media outlets, your FB Class pages, everywhere so we get more people to sign up. The only way this works if if we get enough students to sign the petition!!!**

Here is the most updated version of the letter:

***Dear President Soraya M. Coley, CPP Administration, Semester Conversion Office, and whomever it may concern,***

We, the students of Cal Poly Pomona, feel like the university needs to know some issues that students are facing with registration for Fall 2018.

1. **Waitlist Unit Max Units is Not Enough**: The waitlist max is 6 units, meaning only 2 classes \(3 units each\) can be waitlisted. Here is our problem. Most of us don’t get priority registration, so when registration opens, the only classes we could take \(open classes\) are usually in the evening or professors with poor reviews. So, we enroll in the open class \(unwillingly\) and waitlist ourselves for the better class. However, here is the problem: We can’t waitlist for other classes that we need because it would exceed the unit cap.
2. **Classes available for Summer:** As you know, most students work, have internships, or take classes during the summer. Knowing this, having as many online classes available would probably increase the amount students enrolling in summer classes since we do not have to be near campus to be able to take said, classes. We do acknowledge that some classes must be taken in person, but a lot of us would gladly take more summer classes that we need if it was online. Unfortunately, since limited courses are available, many students have no need to enroll for the summer session.
   1. **Summer Tuition:** This leads us to our next point. Why is tuition for the summer session so expensive? For example, some students take summer classes to repeat courses they failed in the regular school year. But, some of those classes are as little as 1 unit. How fair is it to someone to charge over $1,000 for summer if they are only taking 1 unit?
3. **BroncoDirect:** It is no hidden secret that BroncoDirect \(BD\) has its issues. And, we are willing to put up with a few hiccups here and there. But, it seems that the software is outdated and cannot keep up with the demand of so many students trying to enroll and drop classes during registration. Plus, due to semester conversion, a lot of departments offered semester equivalent classes this year. We were told that when registration for Fall 2018 comes around, we will be able to enroll in classes that have said semester equivalent classes as a prerequisite. Unfortunately, for what seems like the entire university, this registration period has been a huge nightmare. Many students are not going to be able to take classes due to the system not recognizing correct prerequisites and delaying when they can enroll. A big change to BD would be a great benefit to everyone.
   1. **MyPlanner**
4. **Online Classes in General:** As students, having more online classes would open up our schedules tremendously. Since we can work on assignments for those classes whenever we have the time to, it would promote a lot more club involvement and even take some stress off of our busy schedules. Please consider opening more online sections.
5. **No information for Students on how to deal with issues:** During the course of a school year, some issues arise between students and faculty. However, many of us are ill\-informed on what to do in case we do have an issue. And, we get the feeling that if there is a problem, it seems that the professor’s side is always taken. Not to mention, it seems that many of the faculty members that the students constantly have issues with are still continuing their ways or are still employed by the university. It seems as if the professor evaluations we fill out at the end of each term have no effect and are just there to keep us satisfied knowing that our opinions are being heard.

After reading some of our complaints with the school, we hope you will consider some changes to the ways things currently are. We want to grow the reputation of the school and continue to keep CPP a great place to further one’s education. Lastly, at the end of the day, all we want to do is enjoy our time here and succeed.

Thank you

The Students of Cal Poly Pomona

He's my absolute best friend and I love him so much. We've consistently talked everyday for 2 years and then it developed into something more. What intrigued me to him was how different our upbringing was, and just general life experiences, but we still had things to talk abut. I'm second generation, and my parents were strict, so my whole life revolved around grades and getting into a good university. His parents kinda just let him do his own thing.

Anyways we made the big leap and live together. He moved from Ohio to California 3 months ago and honestly we've had very little problems BUT we want different things in the future.

I just want us to be stable and the only way I've seen that is through school. I made it clear education is very important to me and he keeps leaning towards quick, get rich type of deals. He has so many dreams and doesn't believe in school and would rather figure it out on his own. It's always a new scheme and I've tried being open minded and patient to see things work out his way for 3 years but there have been no breakthroughs. And I get it, these things take a while, but I'm trying to be realistic. I know I play it safe. What I'm trying to say is, he deserves someone who will truly be excited for his passions and fully support him. I find myself lacking in that dept.

We talked about how we would a raise a family and I want the whole sha\-bang. I didn't grow up rich but my parents worked their asses off to give me a great upbringing and I feel like I owe it to them to do even better. I don't want to work paycheck to paycheck, I want to go on family vacations. I want a nice house in the suburbs in BUT he's ok with an simple lifestyle; as long as we're happy, money doesn't matter kinda thing. He wants whoever makes the least to stay at home with the kids part time. and I get it, family time. I might sound greedy, but I'm willing to work for it. and im not saying what he wants is bad, I just don't want to settle for that unless i have to. I finish my undergrad in a couple months and i'm currently applying to internships. once i finish, if a get a job anywhere, ill take it. i want to establish myself before i settle down.

Anyways, he moves back to Ohio during my summer break b/c I'm willing to move somewhere for an internship. I didn't tell him to. he came to that conclusion b/c rent is too high on his own. also i gave him full disclosure of possibly moving before he came out here.

I'm hoping the time apart will clear up my mind. but do you think it's enough to end it? I've suggested school so many times, I don't want to nag anymore.

TL;DR Relationship of 3 years, my only relationship, he wants a simple life, I want more. Is it enough for us to not be together even though that is the only conflict in our relationship?"

A little background of myself is I am 23 years old and graduated from college (Rutgers) last year with a BA in Economics. I live in Northern New Jersey and I have been working in sales for the past couple years, and I don't see a real future for myself in that field. However I am a pretty successful salesman and i figured I can apply some of those traits to another field possibly. I have some money saved up (around 10k) and am still living at home with my parents. So, thankfully I have little to no expenses besides my student loans which is close to 40k and I am paying about 450/month on that. Although I know I am still young, i want to get the ball rolling and start a successful career.

I am really open on my options of a career path. Possibly looking to get into a field that involves my degree but unfortunately all the jobs I have been applying to I have not heard back from. I think part of the reason for this is because I did not intern when i was in college and instead worked dead end sales positions. My GPA(3.1) wasn't the greatest as well. Is it possible I can find a company that will take me on as an intern even if i have graduated? I don't mind working for free if it will give me the valuable experience to prepare me for a full time position in that field.

 Also, I have been looking at getting into the real estate field. Real estate is something that has always intrigued me, as not having a capped income is lucrative to me. Maybe i go get my real estate license and become a real estate agent. If any real estate agents from NJ can give there input on careers in real estate I would be thankful.

Lastly, I was also thinking about maybe teaching myself a new skill. For example, learning coding and getting into the CS field. How hard is it to do this, and can I get a job in this field if I graduated with a Econ degree but learned to code later on?

Any other suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

My ears constantly ring and/or pop, my eyes frequently twitch, and I'm almost always dizzy and clumsy. Now that the vertigo and migraine attacks have become more frequent, I fight to stand up or walk (most of the time, I use my grandmother's walker to get to places in my house and a wheelchair to go for long distances), I sometimes blackout and wake up on the floor or against a wall and can't remember how I got there, I can't focus on anything, I feel extremely weak, everything is blurry, literally anything with motion makes me sick, certain body parts are tingling and/or becoming numb (feet, legs, arms, hands), I have slurred speech or I repeat words/statements constantly without meaning to do so, and I'm having trouble holding on to things due to regressing fine motor skills (I constantly drop cups, plates, and feeding utensils that I'm holding, and I can't write very well.). I've been to the ENT because I've always had constant problems with my ears, and I've been to 2 different hospitals in 2 weeks and have had a CT scan, an EKG, and 2 MRIs, and everything came clear. I had a myringotomy done to drain out fluid in my ears, and after getting a hearing test, my ears are fine. The ENT expedited me an appointment with the neurologist for further tests due to concerns with my immobility and regressing fine motor skills, stagnant eye movement, and body numbness. The neurologist says that there is no connection between my symptoms and what was found with the pictures of my brain in the CT scan and MRIs. Then, he talked about conversion disorder, explaining what it was and some of its symptoms (almost every symptom that I have correlates with the disorder). It makes sense, because I've been through some horrible experiences that would traumatize me like this, and I haven't exactly dealt with these events like I needed to. I feel like I'm crazy because it's a psychological disorder and I feel like it's all in my head, but I can't control what happens to my body, especially not now. Anxiety has been a major problem in my life due to emotional abuse from family members and both emotional and physical abuse from ex-boyfriends, plus having a stressful work environment and feeling like I'm not good enough to do what I love due to bad experiences with my student internship at college. Depression has really sunk in due to going from running around with 3-5 year-old kids to hardly being able to do anything. What are your symptoms? What did you do for treatment? Did you have other tests to rule out other causes? How long does it take to cure or contain symptoms from this disorder? Can any of you that are diagnosed with this disorder live a normal life? I would love to get back to teaching, particularly since the principal and assistant principal of the school where I work (but not through the actual school system - the company that I work for just set up a classroom within the school) both stated that they wanted to interview me for another Pre-K program through their school system, and I'd love to finally have that dream job."

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

I am a Civil Engineer Intern in NYC working in the public sector. I have about 1 years of experience on me in regards to inspection work such as asphalt, concrete, soil, and water main, and 6 months design experience. I definitely enjoy working outside in the field as an inspector rather then working inside the office waiting for work \(because it's the public sector and work is dependent on funding, etc\). However, I do not feel accomplished inspecting water\-mains since the task is easy as well as the consultant does most of the paper work and it is not as challenging as vertical constructions or like bridges/ tunnels/ etc.

I recently got accepted to a Master of Engineering program at Cooper and I need help evaluating if it is worth doing. I, like most millennial, am plagued by student debt that was accumulated throughout undergrad. I believe the Master of Engineering would prove to be more challenging and may open more doors for me \(probably design jobs\) when I complete the degree but at the same time is it worth putting on $40k more loans on my shoulder while making public sector salary of less than $50k. 

What are your opinions from your experiences?

It might be hard as a child to understand why your parents work or don't, and it's possible they could learn the wrong things from other children and adults, or even me, as a result. 

Do any of you have parents who are FI/RE? What lessons have you learned from them that you think have helped or hurt you for FI/RE?

Would you be willing to share a bit about your background?

* Do you have parents who were or are becoming FI, are they still? Do you plan to become financially independent?
* Did they retire early? Are they still? Do you plan to retire early?
* Were both parents onboard with FI/RE?
* How did you end up learning about FI concepts? From your parents or somewhere else?
* Any FI/RE lessons learned from your parents that stuck with you.

---

To start it off, here is my background:

My parents are not FI and are not RE. They have high income, but also high expenses. As a result, I never really understood that money was something to be saved, their income was high enough that at any moment we could buy most things, but without understanding the repercussions of debt and future bills. It took until I left to college and my 20's to learn even basic personal finance like not carrying credit debt and eventually FI concepts. I was able to teach my mum about some of these, and she is on her way to FI as well now.

I would never have gotten as far without the financial support I received from my parents, however I've also seen other extended family never learn independence and are solely dependent on their parents. I could have become like that if some opportunities had not been there. A lucky mentor in a hard time, a lucky internship, the right techno-socio-economic climate.

One lesson I learned from my parents on the topic of privilege:

Even though our family is privileged, and thus have the luck to be handed many opportunities, it still rests on us to be capable of taking those opportunities, through things like the appropriate education, social skills, and physical health."

Sorry for what might be a long text post, but I really am a little lost and confused, and I'd like to give you all a good picture of what I'm dealing with.

I worked a busy season Tax internship at a very large, but not big 4, accounting firm this year in Mid-Sized-City-A (don't want to give away too many specifics just in case). I had initially applied in the Fall of 2017 to their Audit internship through campus recruiting, but did not secure it. However, last minute, somebody went on indefinite sick leave, and they asked if I would be willing to work a tax internship instead. I accepted, and early in the process they asked me where I saw myself in 5 years. I responded that I saw myself working in audit in Big-City-B, a fact that they kept on their records. I did mention that, while Big-City-B was my dream, I was certainly open to other options.

On the last day of the internship, I was told to apply of the audit position in Big-City-B, and then given an exit interview, where I was told that they very much wanted me at their firm. They then told me that I would have to meet some people from that office, but that it was a formality, and that the job was mine. Critically, they allowed me to purchase CPA study materials through their firm, for free, something that only future employees are allowed to do by their firm's policy. This last point led me to believe that I really had this job.

I went to meet some of the people in the Big-City-B office the next week, on April 17, even going out to lunch with them. However, it did feel like an interview, not a formality.

I have heard nothing from the firm since, even after multiple emails from my contacts at both offices, and I am very much starting to believe that I might not get the job.

On the positive side, I have contacted everyone that I went to national training with, and they have not received anything yet either. My major concern is the complete radio-silence, as all of my friends have at least had some contact from their respective offices.

I have started looking elsewhere, but I feel like I am quite a ways behind now in the job hunt should this one fall through.

So, a few questions:

1. Is this a reasonable length of time for a firm to take?

2. If it is, why have I not gotten any email responses?

3. If I am not offered employment, will I be required to reimburse the firm for my CPA study materials?

4. Any other advice from here?"

8ibfdc,13,2018-05-09,"Discovering Limerence, Love Addiction, LO Forced Himself onto me, Therapy.",TreeFrog333,limerence,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/8ibfdc/discovering_limerence_love_addiction_lo_forced/,"Hard to know where to start. I only found out about limerence last week after something that happened on a trip abroad that has me doing some serious soul searching. Here is my story. Keep in mind that during these times, I never knew about limerence.

So it turns out I've been high most of my life...since I was 14 (I am now 32). I'm utterly addicted to that cocktail of dopamine, adrenaline etc. that is limerence.

When I was 14, I was obsessed with an older guy in the nearby school, he was 17. Long story short, I lied about my age and we dated. It was akin to me dating my favorite celeb, and I was hooked forever. Since then, I've had 6 long term relationships, one after the other. Often, I'd start a new relationship before the other ended...the feelings for the new LO seemingly appearing from nowhere as my feelings for my SO would dissolve. Usually, the relationship had grown sour after the 1-3 year mark and the high had worn off...so my brain would find another LO with impressive speed and the cycle would start again. 
I was lucky. The vast majority of the time, the feelings of LO were reciprocated, and when it was not, I did some pretty weird stuff myself and my friends still laugh about. But after a few years I was leaving a trail of broken hearts in my wake...which I didn't feel too guilty about as I left out of maltreatment. Most (but not all) of my LOs certainly were not the greatest 'choices'. 
My 4th (nice) LO broke up with me after 2 years. It wasn't dramatic and we remained friends. I was indeed upset, but got over it quickly as the high had worn off anyway and I was extremely busy with my final year in college. So, I concentrated on that for 3 months until I finished and daydreamed about 'falling in love' again at the beginning of summer.

Because it was ALWAYS at the beginning of summer.

It was my birthday in May, we all went out and then went to a house party. I kissed a beautiful guy from a different country. His English wasn't great but I spoke some some of his. The next day, I was waiting at the bus stop, and BAM! The intrusive thoughts began. I am convinced that limerence inspired the story of Cupid's arrow. His friend came over to visit for a month and we had an amazing, albeit crazy time. VERY VERY long and dramatic story short, we ended up together for 3 years, which was my most tumultuous relationship to date. I moved in with him after 6 months for economic reasons (to help him out). Due to huge financial worries, cultural differences, resentment etc, the high wore off fairly quickly but our lives were now very intertwined and insular. I knew I had to leave but it was so, so hard....until new LO came along.
Granted, during this relationship I had had smaller LOs. new male friends I got on with well and would end up having involuntary obsessive thoughts about them, and chatting with them online...not really flirty but just enjoying their company. But the limerence would fade after 2 weeks. But this new LO hit me like a ton of bricks and was the strongest limerence I had ever experienced. 

It was time to leave.

It was so hard, but I managed to make an arrangement with my SO who I was living with..I moved out but still contributed financially to help him until his internship started paying him 6 months later. he helped me with other bits of work I needed for my small business and we were both happy.
So now I have a new SO and as mentioned, it was the strongest limerence I have ever experienced. I suffer quite badly from menstrual cramps but for the first 6 months of being with my new SO I felt NO PAIN. It was magical. Strangers on the street would constantly comment pleasantly on my massive grin. I couldn't eat. Could barely sleep. I kept almost hallucinating and thinking I saw him when I was out and about. I felt like I was being watched by him constantly. I felt utterly high, especially as I inhaled the pollen and warm summer air. Summer is a major trigger for me. All the music I listened to absorbed my highness and if  listen to any music that I discovered whilst highly limerent it will give me a flutter. Sometimes, it's too much to bear and I have to turn it off. But I also felt that tense, anxious feeling of dread. 'What if he doesn't feel the same way', 'I'm not good enough' etc. Massively insecure.
5 months later he started a new 2 year job in a stunning city, and I visited every 5 weeks, and each weekend I was there was like a Disney movie. The whole set up was ideal, as I was able to put ALL of my time into developing my small business, whilst enjoying the high feeling and the bursts of dopamine that came from his online messages. If he remained in my city, I do not think my business would have developed as it did. Likewise, if we weren't together, I would have been way too distracted looking for a new LO, and business would have suffered,

Exactly 4 years have passed. And it is the beginning of summer.

Our relationship is perfect. The anxiety has gone. We both have the same political values and want to remain childfree. My family love him and vice versa. We travel many times a year, eat and drink with lots of friends and have a really chilled, drama-free relationship and get on so, so well. We still have great sex. I am really, really happy in this relationship.

So then WHY did this happen?!?!??

I went on a trip abroad with 2 friends to visit a friend's sister. It was my first time travelling with friends and not my SO and I was excited but I knew I'd miss him, especially as we had been to this city together before. My ex's friend also lives there, the guy who visited for a month. I hadn't seen him in 7 years, and he told me to let him know if I was ever in his city. I never met up with him the first time I was there so I made sure to this time.
We were both tipsy when we met and gave each other a huge hug and I just felt really hyper then. There were body language signs that he was flirting with me but I didn't take much heed of it (although my subconscious limerence seeking brain was). We got on really well and it reminded me of the crazy fun time we all had when he visited 7 years ago. Nostalgia is not good for my limerence prone brain.
We met him the next night and went to a party, and again, we all had a great time and myself and him played the music we listened to 7 years ago (when I was in deep limerence with his friend). This may have been triggering.

The next day, myself and my 2 friends just had a chilled out day and night. He was messaging me about meeting up to party again. I was getting suspicious flutters when he messaged. Uh oh. But I ignored the feeling. The girls were tired and we were gonna get an early night. But I was slowly becoming addicted and wanted to hang out again.
The next day was our last night, Myself and the girls went out for dinner and the thoughts of him were becoming more intrusive. When I went to the restroom, I had to gather myself and take deep breaths. I did NOT want these feelings, I have an amazing SO at home. This didn't make any sense. This only EVER happened to me when the relationship was going stale and mine was from from that. 
My friend noticed I was talking about him a little too much today. Uh oh. It was a compulsion. I tried to control it. We drank a lot, and it was fun. Then the girls wanted to go eat. I couldn't eat a thing. Uh oh. No appetite. I knew what this meant. I then started to feel angry that my friends wanted to go eat and not straight to the bar to meet with my new LO. They had become barriers now, not friends. The tiny logical part of my brain was like, 'why are you getting secretly mad at them, you freak?! Enjoy the dinner and drink!' and the limerent part was like 'MUST SEEK OUT LO AT ALL COSTS, MOVE'.

Later on, he finally arrived at the bar. And I jumped up and gave him a huge hug and we went out for a cigarette. I couldn't wait to talk to him. I wanted to stay up and smoke and drink and talk to him all night. I felt that warm, fuzzy, cotton-wool feeling of contentment around him (oxytocin), and no anxiety from the limerence because we were drunk. I was so excited that we were friends, though only a week ago I felt indifference. But now he was radiant. 

He came back to our AirBnB for a drink with us. We were chatting on the couch and my friends went to bed. As soon as they went, he just, WENT for me and grabbed my chin and tried to kiss me, almost on top of me. I pulled away and said 'no'. He kept trying, and I mean KEPT trying. I kept pulling away saying 'this is never gonna happen, we are both in a relationship and it's weird anyway'. He wasn't listening and his hands were ALL over me. And I hate that I was enjoying the attention. His Uber arrived then and I stood up and hugged him goodbye at the door. But then neither of us could let go, we were like magnets. He pinned me against the wall (he's about 6' 3'' and I am about 5' 4'') and kept trying to kiss me again, his hands grabbing my ass, breasts etc, as I tried to push them away from actually going up my dress. It was really intense. It felt like he wanted to consume me and had me completely engulfed. A few times I honestly thought he was going to rip my clothes of there and then, regardless. It was scary. But I kinda liked it. I kept saying no and pushing his hands away BUT....my body was thrust right up against his, of its own accord. Then my body was overcome with this carnal, lust. He lifted his leg up between my legs to stimulate me. Then he picked me up and put my legs around him and basically dry humped me....and it felt good and I hated that. My clit was on fire and I felt as high as a kite. I jumped down and we hugged again, but then snapped out of it, I ran back into the apartment (we were in the corridor) and closed the door. And then I fell asleep.

I woke up utterly confused and thought it was a dream at first, as I have had many similar dreams (interestingly). I felt dread, excitement, guilt, shame, intense horniness, disgust, sexiness. 
And I thought about it on the whole 6 hour flight home. Obsessively. It was so intrusive and powerful and I just wanted it to stop but I couldn't. I kept replaying the situation over and over and over again and feeling deeply aroused by it, despite it going against my values (enthusiastic consent, my SO etc.). I kept fantasizing about us in that wonderful city and me visiting. Ugh. GO AWAY! 
I was exhausted when I got home and went to bed. My clit was still on fire and after much resistance, I masturbated to the scenario and felt super guilty, but it gave me some physical relief. He had messaged me about how he had such an awesome time hanging out. I was desperate to message my poor, gorgeous SO. I went for a walk and could see this LO almost everywhere.
I stayed up ALL night researching what the fuck happened, looking for answers. Was I poly?!? I don't think so?? I found all that 'New Relationship Energy' stuff. Then I found out about Love Addiction. And Limerence, And I did some serious digging and everything began to make sense.

I am a love addict. I am a limerence addict. And I have been high for most of my life. It makes me feel so, so alive. When I was in my early 20s I experimented with molly and cocaine and limerence is even stronger. When I was a kid I had pretty bad OCD which I thought I had 'grown out of'. But it feels like this limerence just replaced it....it's so similar to OCD. Moreover, many love addicts had childhood trauma. My father unfortunately beat myself and my sister when we were kids. She is also a limerent. I see it in some of my friends too. But I never felt affected by that because otherwise, my parents were amazing and gave us everything we ever needed and were always present, and still are, and always will be. My dad also apologized and I had never, ever held it against him, his amazing actions for the past few decades spoke for themselves. But we are fragile creatures and my brain must have developed some coping mechanism from a young age without me even realizing it.

Exactly one week has passed now and the limerence for that LO fades more day after day. I can eat again and the hollow, aching pain in my chest has subsided greatly. Sometimes I catch myself thinking about him and wondering if he'll message but then it goes away. The songs still sometimes play in my head and give me that annoying longing, yearning feeling. I know it will fade completely and I'll be thinking, 'wtf, why him', as has happened before many times. But it will resurface again with somebody else, no doubt.

Why did I only find out about this now? Oh, I wish I had known many years ago. I cannot believe this isn't common knowledge, limerence can ruin lives when it is mistaken for love, especially if you want children.

The reason why it took me so long was because I had just assumed that I had naturally 'fallen out of love' with my previous partners and then found a new one pretty easily. But I have NOT fallen out of love with my SO. The limerence had faded at some point recently (been together 4 years) and I think we were about to move on to the next mature, non infatuation stage. But my brain has never experienced that and was scanning for an LO and found one that night on the trip. Moreover, this LO was the LAST person I would EVER be in a relationship with. He was fun and great to talk to, but had serious issues I could never deal with in a relationship (and a kid).  So the issue was NOT the shortcomings of my SO, everything was amazing. Nor was it because I found an amazing LO, he was far from ideal. The issue was me.

So I am shopping for a therapist and I am excited, nervous, scared and relieved to start working on whatever issues I have. I've also ordered some books online. I want nothing more than to stay with my SO and survive well past the selfish limerence stage. I believe we can. I may encounter random episodes of limerence with random people, but at least now I know exactly what it is and that it will pass. Also, if SO ever breaks up with me in the future, I want to feel comfortable in being single and not desperately search for another LO. I do not want to objectify anybody or project my fantasies onto them. I need to learn how to be sober and content.....dreading it also as I have no idea what that's like.

This has been a profound experience and despite it being harrowing and debilitating, I am grateful for everything I have learned and the journey I will be embarking on. I will work on forgiving myself and on overcoming this strange addiction. I exhibit other signs on anxiety, low self esteem and novelty seeking and these are most likely related. If this experience never happened, I would not be seeking help. Every cloud....!

I would love to know if ANYTHING in this story rings true for anyone else! How you learned about limerence, Or if you have had similar patterns in life. Did you forgive yourself? Did therapy help? Were you able to maintain relationships after limerence had passed?

Thank you.

I've taken a recent interest in non-profits and volunteer opportunities as of late. I currently go to school in San Diego, but am going home (Huntington Beach) for the summer and have about 3 and a half months to do nothing but work part time at my summer internship in Santa Ana. 
 
Are there any suggestions for volunteer work at local shelters and/or non-profits that I could get into? I've volunteered in non-profits that focus on women empowerment, global development, food security, and sustainability in the past and really enjoyed it.

Edit: Thank you everyone! I’m going to check these out!"
8ibo5v,1,2018-05-09,I [23f] don't know if this is enough to breakup with my bf [23m] of 3 years because of this?,fizzywizz911,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ibo5v/i_23f_dont_know_if_this_is_enough_to_breakup_with/,"To start off, we met online. He's my absolute best friend and I love him so much. We've consistently talked everyday for 2 years and then it developed into something more. What intrigued me to him was how different our upbringing was, and just general life experiences, but we still had things to talk abut. I'm second generation, and my parents were strict, so my whole life revolved around grades and getting into a good university. His parents kinda just let him do his own thing.

Anyways we made the big leap and live together. He moved from Ohio to California 3 months ago and honestly we've had very little problems BUT we want different things in the future.

I just want us to be stable and the only way I've seen that is through school. I made it clear education is very important to me and he keeps leaning towards quick, get rich type of deals. He has so many dreams and doesn't believe in school and would rather figure it out on his own. It's always a new scheme and I've tried being open minded and patient to see things work out his way for 3 years but there have been no breakthroughs. And I get it, these things take a while, but I'm trying to be realistic. I know I play it safe. What I'm trying to say is, he deserves someone who will truly be excited for his passions and fully support him. I find myself lacking in that dept.

We talked about how we would a raise a family and I want the whole sha\-bang. I didn't grow up rich but my parents worked their asses off to give me a great upbringing and I feel like I owe it to them to do even better. I don't want to work paycheck to paycheck, I want to go on family vacations. I want a nice house in the suburbs in BUT he's ok with an simple lifestyle; as long as we're happy, money doesn't matter kinda thing. He wants whoever makes the least to stay at home with the kids part time. and I get it, family time. I might sound greedy, but I'm willing to work for it. and im not saying what he wants is bad, I just don't want to settle for that unless i have to. I finish my undergrad in a couple months and i'm currently applying to internships. once i finish, if a get a job anywhere, ill take it. i want to establish myself before i settle down.

Anyways, he moves back to Ohio during my summer break b/c I'm willing to move somewhere for an internship. I didn't tell him to. he came to that conclusion b/c rent is too high on his own. also i gave him full disclosure of possibly moving before he came out here.

I'm hoping the time apart will clear up my mind. but do you think it's enough to end it? I've suggested school so many times, I don't want to nag anymore.

TL;DR Relationship of 3 years, my only relationship, he wants a simple life, I want more. Is it enough for us to not be together even though that is the only conflict in our relationship?"
8ibor9,6,2018-05-09,Help! When should I apply?? Preparation?,sheerio2,peacecorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/8ibor9/help_when_should_i_apply_preparation/,"Hey all, this is probably going to be a long one so if you read all the way through, thank you in advance!!

I'm finishing up my second year in college right now as a Global Disease Bio major. I am going to do some Alzheimer's Clinical Research this summer and possibly some clinical research with autism and plan to be a teacher's assistant at an elementary school during the fall to gain some experience working with children. I'm also making plans to intern abroad in South Africa next summer. (A lot of planning, not doing, I know haha)

I was thinking of volunteering in the health sector of PC. With that being said, what more can I do? I definitely feel like there's A LOT of room to build my resume.

Also, how far out would you typically apply for PC? I plan on starting service at least within the first year of graduation, so sometime between Summer 2020-Summer 2021. 

ALSO, how helpful is talking to a recruiter? I imagine it's somewhat biased since they are trying to recruit, but was it at least helpful? 

Thanks again :)"
8ibqso,1,2018-05-09,"With SSI disability, is there a legal state where rent/utilities wouldn't be higher than that?",UpperRadish,NORML,https://www.reddit.com/r/NORML/comments/8ibqso/with_ssi_disability_is_there_a_legal_state_where/,"It's uncomfortable because I do appreciate the $750 and I do volunteer work 10 hours a week doing what I can on days I'm able, because it drove me crazy sitting in my room all the time, I have to be doing something but my brain and body often don't want to.

CBD oil helps a little but I believe that something full spectrum with thc and cbd and all the others, like straight from the flower and not messed with.  It's hard justifying spending $100 a month on just one cannabinoid when there's at least 113-120.  

I have a vape mod and someone said try vaping.  I have a sub ohm tank, anyone know where a place is I could get a sample or small amount to see if it works better?  I read someone liking vaping better and they vape cbd isolate throughout the day and it working better than anti-depressants.  

Now we have hemp flowers on sale online for all 50 states, that's really cool.  I might try an oz of hemp flower with the high cbd.  It's just I read it's better from cannabis indica or sativa and not hemp which is more for rope/clothing/etc.

I want a job trimming or growing.  I'm hoping to meet someone who would mentor me and I would move in the same area and learn/help through a grow season or a few, not for money but to learn like an intern.

I don't want to move and then not know anyone or have any friends and the problem is rent is usually over $600 around here so after rent/water/elec/internet even without cable I would have zero for cannabis because health insurance won't cover it. 

Maybe if I trimmed and was able to keep 2oz of trim each month if that would make enough oil to use daily (I have no idea how much).  It's just hard to find $100 in a month for cannabis, and I don't know anyone who sells it where I live.  It's so frustrating being one of the people who REALLY needs it and benefits from it in so many ways, to the point of keeping me from suicide.  And it's dangling right in front of me, everyone getting high and having fun.  I wish it was some random pill that worked so I could take it and move on but I have to wait for legalization or to move and have a mentor to trim for 2oz of trim a month or find a roommate and we made a bedroom one big grow room.

Outside would be amazing too.  Also living in a beautiful place like Colorado.  I just need a miracle situation to happen.  It's really hard having this agony and cannabis stops it but even if I could find it I couldn't afford to use it all day.  I'm hoping oil will last longer so I don't have to smoke it.

I just want to grow weed and have cookouts with friends, maybe watch movies.  I just can't drink alcohol because it doesn't do well for me.

I do think the bi-polar diagnosis in my 20's was right.  I go to extremes on everything and have highs but mostly bad lows.  Sober 8 months though from alcohol, that's really my main goal right now is to get past a year.  I've wrecked a few cars when drinking.  I drank every day just to be around people because the autism made it so hard to be around strangers in school.

Even if I had a trail in the woods, that would be nice.  I don't like the city.  I want to be around as much cannabis as possible, like a volunteer for 100's of trees would be awesome, I would camp out and live there and protect those trees with my sling."
8ic2fe,3,2018-05-09,MBA grad (with engineering background) looking for advice on how to maximize chance to move into PM (graduating in 2019),MahxPooling,ProductManagement,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/8ic2fe/mba_grad_with_engineering_background_looking_for/,"Hi everyone, long time fan of this subreddit and seeking your advice on this throwaway account on how to best position myself as I am about to embark on my recruiting journey soon. Any advise or comments about any section will be appreciated!

My background:

I am currently a dual degree candidate getting my MS in CS and MBA at a top engineering and business school (think Stanford/MIT/Berkeley) and entering my last year. Before this, I had been working for a few years in the SF Bay Area as a electrical engineer at a mid-sized tech company that made well known consumer devices (think GoPro/Fitbit/Roku) doing interesting work in both software and hardware. At that job, I was able eventually take on project lead/management role where I got to work across the company with hardware/software engineers and product managers.

Before that, I did my undergrad in EE at a top engineering school (similar caliber as my current grad school) with two summer internships in a big tech company (think Microsoft/Google/Amazon).

During my time in grad school, I was hyper-focused on getting my hand dirty on the CS side taking classes in data science, machine learning, and UI design/implementation, because I've hear a lot about how tech companies value a CS background when it comes to hiring PMs. Similarly on the MBA side, I've been focused on taking only coursework that aligns with common PM skills. For example, I've been taking courses in marketing and tech strategy with the hopes of getting an idea on how to find/evaluate user needs, conduct interviews, write user personas/stories, and think about product strategy. 

Because of a special requirement of my program, I could not recruit on my own to any summer PM internships. Instead the school matched me with a summer internship. Good news is that it is at another big tech company (think Microsoft/Google/Amazon). Bad news is that it is a data analytics/science internship (so no direct PM experience to work with).

Here are my strengths and concerns (feel free to comment on whether you agree):

Pros:

* Strong technical background and education

* Good hands on experience with building a wide range of technology (plenty of projects to show spanning 
electronics and software, even past patents from my work)

* Will have a CS degree

* Worked before at well known tech companies

Cons/Concerns (feel free to comment on whether you agree):

* Resume still looks too ""Engineer"" even with the MBA. Most of my accomplishments I can talk about are all technical.

* Lack of direct PM experience (no PM summer internship, which is the main way MBAs pivot into PM. Maybe could have done some part-time PM work at university start-ups but was too busy with coursework to take that on)

Plan moving forward (feel free to comment on whether you agree):

* Find a balance between my resume being too ""engineer"" vs too ""typical MBA"" (I know some tech companies get turned off by MBAs?)

* Find ways to take on PM-like responsibilities at my summer data analytics/science internship

* Find ways to network with PMs in my summer internship company

* Reading books that have been recommended to me about PM (Cracking the PM interview, etc.)

* Try to network with alumni from my school via Linkedin who are in PM

I know there are bigger tech companies that have a structure recruiting process for MBAs (Amazon's SPM and STPM roles come to mind).

However, I am more interested in trying to get into technical product management roles at smaller tech companies (Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, etc.). I have a feeling that these companies typically do not usually look for MBAs, but CS grads with previous PM experience.

What do you guys think? Are my concerns valid? Any comments or feedback is appreciated."

8icuyn,1,2018-05-10,Recent defective Switches?,KeplersSomnium,NintendoSwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/8icuyn/recent_defective_switches/,"I would like to know how many defective Switches had been selling recently, both on hardware or software. Anybody have a statistic about the numbers?

I am a Mexican student and currently I am in Japan for a research internship, but I am really really considering buying a Switch in Japan. Here there are the pro and cons I have analyzed:


Pros: about half the price, the perfect japanese souvenir for a Nintendo whole-life-fan.
Cons: warranty issues.

I am aware that in case of malfunction I should send the Switch back to Japan to get a repair. But also I am very cautious with my things, using always extra safety measures. I have owned Nintendo consoles since SNES to NDS without any malfunction or problem.
But I know Switch started with hardware and software problems since its release, that (and the exaggerated price in Mexico) is why I didn't bought a Nintendo Switch before. That's why I would like to know the recent issues with the Nintendo Switch, the numbers, and estimate what would be the probability that it would be defective."

8idvjn,14,2018-05-10,What advice would you give to statistics / data science undergraduates?,statscsfanatic21,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/8idvjn/what_advice_would_you_give_to_statistics_data/,"I feel like I'm in this position where I'm just moving too slowly. Like there's just so much to learn but I'm just not sure if I'll be employable enough by the time I finish my university education and come out to work.

I've also just finished a Python programming class, and next semester my school will be going on to R and 2 obscure languages (I think SPSS or something along those lines). I initially wanted to do an internship too but unfortunately, most companies just aren't looking for year 1 university students so that's out of the equation (for this year).

Anyway, it would be great if I could get some professional advice from people who have advanced in this field.

1) what language to learn? I know python is definitely a must. How about R and SQL? Any other recommendations (JavaScript, C++ etc)?

2) what are some ways to build up on my resume? From what I've researched, it seems kaggle and creating a blog to showcase my skillsets would be good.

If it helps, I'm thinking of getting a Master's in statistics / data science in the future. I think there isn't any room to climb in this industry without at least a Master's. **If you think otherwise, do share too. I'm very open to perspectives.**

Any kind of advice would be appreciated, thanks."
8idya5,1,2018-05-10,"Hi all, looking to build a PC (everything included) that will be for design work and some short video editing. It's for a design intern so doesn't have to be top, top end, but functional and supports Adobe apps.",spork215,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/8idya5/hi_all_looking_to_build_a_pc_everything_included/,"&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Graphic Design work (Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator) and Video Editing (Adobe Premiere Pro / Adobe After Effects). I'm open to a Mac if that works out better / cheaper, and can move over to Final Cut Pro for Video Editing instead if that's the case. Everyone in my office is PC and I use a PC here but a Mac at home, the intern can use both. I'm wary of getting a Mac for the file sharing implications of reformatting hard drives etc, when I'm getting OS files off her to put on my own Dell PC. 

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

Around €1000 - €1200. Lower the better, we have so  little budget left this year already! :(

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

This week.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

Everything! Tower, PC, OS, keyboard, mouse, monitor. 

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Ireland. 

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Dell USB Keyboard, Kensington USB Optical Mouse. This is what we could end up using if I need to find extra parts in the office. 

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

Down the line at some stage. 

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

Anything that makes graphic design / video editing quicker and easier!

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

No. 

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Yes, but no preference. 

Nope, thank you in advance :)"

8ifkam,10,2018-05-10,How to prepare for student loan repayment as a current student?,zk2997,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8ifkam/how_to_prepare_for_student_loan_repayment_as_a/,"I have just finished my second year of my bachelor's degree in computer science. Unfortunately, I go to one of the most expensive public universities in the country and I am going to have soooo much debt when I graduate. My parents make too much for me to qualify for any grants but they make too little to help with the tuition. So I am 100% on my own in this endeavor. By the time I graduate, I will most likely have about $120K in debt based on my estimations.

My question is: what can I do to prepare for this loan repayment when I graduate in two years? Obviously, getting a good job would be the best option. The average pay for graduates of my major from my school is about $77K, but I'm hoping to make more than that. I have an internship this summer and I'm hoping to get an even better one for next summer on top of doing research potentially. So I am starting to build a decent resume to put myself in that situation.

Most of my loans are private loans through Sallie Mae and I got HORRIBLE interest rates despite my dad cosigning (his credit score is high 700s) and my own credit score of low-to-mid 700s. Most of my rates are just below 10% so obviously I need to refinance ASAP. Any tips for that?

I'm also starting to think about where I would live after I graduate and as much as I would love to go after a Silicon Valley job, I've pretty much eliminated that as an option. I'm looking into Seattle potentially just because the pay for CS jobs is high but without the crazy Bay Area cost of living. I'm also interested in Colorado and Texas which have quite low cost of living as well. Of course, I could stay in my home state of PA or the East coast in general, but I'm looking to move west if possible. If anyone knows of any other booming tech areas that are cheap to live in let me know please.

Finally, what lifestyle choices can I make to prepare for my loan repayment? I would say I live somewhat frugally currently, but any advice is appreciated.


TL;DR: I'll be graduating with 120K in debt, what can I do to make it not suck?"
8ifvuv,2,2018-05-10,Queen's CS vs UW math,sadunireject,queensuniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/8ifvuv/queens_cs_vs_uw_math/,"I just got rejected from everything at UW except math and I'm trying to weigh my options for next year. I am considering taking a double major of Computational Math + Combinatorics/Optimization at Waterloo or the Computer Science stream at Queen's. 

The main reason I am interested in UW is because of their co-op.

Could anyone from computing shed some light on:


1. Job opportunities in summer (not internship). I heard Kingston doesn't have much of a job prospect for CS field. Does anyone have any experience finding jobs through Indeed (or other platforms) in nearby cities like Toronto/Ottawa/Montreal?


2. The quality of the program at Queen's. I've searched on this sub and the reactions seem pretty mixed. A lot seem to think that the program is out of date and the professors are not very good. 


3. Intership. In my opinion, unless you get a good/meaningful position at a relatively well known company, spending 12-16 months is not as beneficial as having multiple positions at different companies (co-op), which would greatly expand your skillset and work experience. What are common interships for CS students at Queen's. Is it common for people to get interships in the States, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area?



I have visited Queen's for the open house and for a week long SEEDS program back in grade 7 and I absolutely love the campus. From what I've heard from my friends, the school environment is absolutely amazing. 

Thanks!"

I don't know if I'd see you again, but I'm waiting anyway. Instead of buying a ticket home for the long weekend, I bought a new shirt to wear for if I see you.

Throughout the week, little memories of you keep popping up in my mind. Like that quiet morning when we stayed late in bed. Or you brewing tea for me and making breakfast. You singing songs you didn't quite understand.  

But really, the most precious memory of all has been our first meeting. Oh, we were so different back then. I keep saying that, I know, because it reminds me how impermanent everything is. 

In July, I'll be doing my internship at one of the biggest automotive factories in Malaysia. I don't know if I'll meet someone new there. And I don't know where I'll continue studying after finishing my internship and graduating, and where I'll work and settle down. 

And I don't know if I want you alongside me as I go through all these life stages. But my heart says it might be nice, if you want to. 

But then again, life is short, so I'll find out. 

I know you really want to leave this country so badly, and so do I, you know. But when I met you, I had a sudden of change of heart. Maybe Malaysia is alright, I thought. 

Oh well. Whatever happens to us, I know it's for the best. I don't know why I think that. I just do. I can feel it too.

8igeri,5,2018-05-10,"I keeping seeing an ad for my exBPD partner's book come up on social media, and it's killing me.",caramelgelato,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/8igeri/i_keeping_seeing_an_ad_for_my_exbpd_partners_book/,"My exBPD bf and I of 9 months split in the fall of 2016. I won't go into the whole spiel about everything that transpired, but I started going to therapy for it last month. My therapist is convinced that my exBPD bf worsened my already existing anxiety disorder among other things, and we're working on unpacking all the trauma.

In the midst of all of this, I've seen ads for my ex's recently published book on multiple social media sites. It's painful because even though I've objectively made leaps and bounds since we've split-- I have a better paying job, I'm no longer self-harming as a result of having to keep my feelings inside around him, and I have an extremely loving partner-- I've been stagnant in other ways. I don't go out as much because I don't trust people as much. I have panic attacks. My confidence is still shot. Additionally, I'm an artist by education and passion, and I haven't been able to create consistently since our relationship. I am no longer employed in the field I have a degree in. Art no longer brings me comfort or confidence, but it makes me feel inadequate. I'm so jealous of him. Whenever I fail at a project, I can always hear him in my head saying, ""You're lazy!"" or ""Why aren't you fucking trying?""

Also, I let go of a major artistic opportunity because of him: he accused me of ""sleeping with all the men"" at my internship. Now, these folks are touring the world and making money off of their art. They originally wanted me to tag along on their world tour, but I ghosted them to appease my ex. I don't feel like I can fix my partnership with them because one of the bosses knows and adores my ex, and I'm afraid to tell her about the abuse.

Why does he get to charge ahead and become this beloved darling of the art world when I have to go spend my time and money to see a fucking shrink partially due to the damage he's done to me? Why does he get to succeed in his field, but I got triggered by seeing this stupid advertisement and ended up crying on the floor of my room for an hour?

Worst of all, I can't #MeToo this and tell the majority of our mutual friends this. I know how he'll frame it: ""Caramelgelato is crazy. Caramelgelato cut herself when we were dating. I believe Caramelgelato cheated on me.""

He made me switch psychiatric medications while we were dating. I told him I wanted to get off the first one I was on and just go to therapy because the side effects were annoying, but then he told me to go get on another drug because I was ""too emotional"" when he yelled at me. I went back to the psychiatrist just to appease him, and the second drug I was on made me volatile and made me retaliate back when we started arguments, which isn't like me and made me look ""crazy."" It was awful.

Near the end of our relationship, whenever I cried as a result of him, he'd just turn to me and say, ""You need to take your meds."" He wouldn't ask me what was wrong or console me.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation where their exBPD partner has seemed to charm everyone around them and excel while they're still struggling?

edit: I should mention that we've been NC since the end of 2016, but it just sucks because ads like that occur automatically on social media. Also, some of his work has been exhibited at the same art shows as my friends and I see ads for that, too"

The way Cisco words some questions is actually criminal, and be wary of the odd question being beyond the scope of CCNA.

Passed ICND1 back in February with a high score so stuck to my tried and tested study methods. Also, massive thanks to this subreddit for keeping me motivated. 

Started by watching CBTNuggets videos, and aimed for a chapter a week of Todd Lammle's book, taking notes along the way. I found this book much easier to read and I find it cuts a lot of the waffle from the Official Cisco guide. Big shout out to Boson practice exams, I don't think I would've passed without these. I knew I was ready for the exam when I was scoring 90% plus. 

I'm currently an intern at an ISP and work on Cisco devices day in day out, this really helped solidify concepts.

My advice to anyone would be: do practice questions, practice questions, practice questions!

She had a boyfriend at the time We ended up sleeping together even while they were dating. 

We had excellent chemistry, and had sex very often, in our dorm beds. We also kissed a lot and I still remember her kisses. We travelled and went to raves often and I remember having sex with her in hotel rooms. I moved in with her for the year, and slept with her in her dorm, in her bed. I still remember us in bed, with our arms around each other, even if we weren’t kissing or having sex.

She and I broke up a quarter way  through her grad school due to long distance.. For a while, she moved in with me in my dorm. I spent weekends with her and often bunked school to drive and stay with her and spent many nights at her place, since the drives were long. She moved on very quickly and dated other guys after me. 

She got a job, did her masters, date/hook up with a few guys, had a few boyfriends and met her current husband, and had a few kids with him.  They married very quickly. I learned from her work ethic, and admire how smart and beautiful she is. She will also start her PhD soon. I looked through photos and saw photos of us. I started feeling bad about not being with her, and I still really miss her.

I got drunk with my fraternity brothers to get over her but I just ended up texting her and we agreed to meet up on Wednesday. 

I miss playing video games with her and spending time with her and she and I exchanged our PSN/Xbox Live/Steam and even our Nintendo Network IDs. I had so much fun playing Mario Kart, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Halo, GTA, Smash Bros, and even Fortnite after so many years. We played online and that brought us back to college.

She made many big differences in my life. She helped me grow. She exposed me to travel and raves and we traveled frequently in breaks or went to the city in weekends.

Last weekend, I hung out with my ex girlfriend and my female best friend. We went out to eat and we caught up. She discussed her husband and kids. She is contemplating naming her next child after me.

We then went to my dorm and smoked weed. I had an arm around both of them. I also kissed both of them on the cheek and both of them kissed me on the cheek as well. We also got so drunk we ended up passing out in my bed.

I feel so sorry for what happened. I don’t want anything else to happen and  all 3 of us agreed that we drank too much and what happened is inappropriate. I want to cut off my ex girlfriend but we have so much fun playing video games online. 

How do I forget her? Or at least, limit our interactions to texting and online video games? I remember the change she made in my life. She helped me apply for my computer science internship when I was studying computer science, and her husband is looking to offer me a business internship. I do have a fast food job that I got because my ex introduced me to a guy she had a one night stand with.

I understand this is so inappropriate but I really enjoyed our time in person and our time online gaming.

TL;DR: I hung out with my ex and my female best friend, smoked weed, and we passed out after drinking. I also kissed them on the cheek and they kissed me too. What should I do?"

We have a pretrial conference scheduled for next week, and thankfully we agreed on custody already so we just have to hash out finances. We don't own any real estate, and our only joint asset is a car that's under water, and he wants me to keep even though I've said on several occasions I cannot afford to make the payment.

He wants to pay $300 a month for 3 years in alimony, and will take all the debt but my student loans \(which I get the judge won't split anyway\) and the car. My student loan debt is way more than all the other debt combined.

He quit his job when I hired an attorney to prevent me from getting any child support, which I understand is a common thing for abusers to do. We quickly battened down the hatches, and my wonderful family helped me reduce my bills to the lowest possible. Even then, the kids and I will not have sufficient for our needs on child support and alimony alone. With only one year left, I am desperate not to drop out of school, and I'll do whatever I can to work it out and finish strong. I have a paid internship, and work study opportunities next semester. I know I don't have the capacity to work an outside job, take care of 2 kids, and do all my course work. I know a lot of other people who can, and I respect that, but I know my own limitations, and I respect them, too. 

I'm pissed because he's a stranger now, someone who I feel I've been assigned to raise two kids with, like characters in a dystopian novel. I realized the other day that I'm a stranger to him, too, and there are so many important details of my life now that he has no clue about, since we've been separated for over 18 months. I want to make the best of things, and I want a positive co\-parenting relationship with him, but I also feel like setting him on fire....haven't worked out yet how to get from here to there, and that's a problem.

I want to be done with this divorce. I want to move on and work on forgiving him and building a new life with my kids.   I am dying to accept this offer just be be DONE! But I can't. I am pretty confident that I will get a better deal going to court, and I can't afford to stop fighting now. "
8ii9p3,4,2018-05-10,"I need some advice, my mother and father are extremely toxic, and won't listen to reason.",Mistress_Impervious,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8ii9p3/i_need_some_advice_my_mother_and_father_are/,"I need some advice. Yesterday I was accidentally outed to my parents by my pharmacy, and now my parents know I'm transgender. I am 20 years old, in my 3rd year of college, with little to know financial stability. I start a summer internship on the 15th, but I'm being threatened by my mother that I cannot go. 

How can I help my mother see that she and my father have been abusive to me, and are continuing to do so? I'm the eldest of 6 children, which is hard being the ""role model""  

For most of my life I've been poor, but my mother was always able to pull thru and make sure that she was giving us a ""normal"" childhood. She keeps using this as an excuse, but the reality of it is as follows:

I was verbally abused to the extreme as a kid, with mild physical abuse. My father wasn't around much since he was (and still is) the only source of income in the family. My mother was sweet and nice until I was around 6, but then everything went downhill from there. I was always made to feel worthless (being told I was wrong at every turn, and being constantly told I was not to be trusted). When I was in middle school my mother constantly told me I was ""the school shooter type"", which didn't help that I was depressed and suicidal at 12. 

My father was never around, and just existed. That's it. He doesn't involve himself much, but can be both very nice, and easy to anger. He has dramatically gotten better in the past 10 years and now is a really nice guy. However my mom and him have a really toxic marriage, he makes all the income, my mom manages it and dictates what he spends. 

I tried coming out as transgender 3 years ago, and it went horrible. A screaming match for 2 weeks, and verbal abuse until I went to college. My pharmacy outed me accidentally yesterday (they called and left a voicemail about my meds), and since then I have heard extremely abusive stuff from my mother, and my dad won't talk to me. My dad had an argument this morning with my mom, and has since then left for Michigan for work (he had to go back and finish a project he started Monday). My mother is threatening to take my car and to not pay the payment before I leave (payment is due on the 14th, I don't start my summer internship until the 15th). 


I'm honestly thinking of just leaving this family (not that I have a choice, my mom doesn't want to support me), but I don't want to leave behind my brothers. How can I manage to stabilize this?"

8iipqr,14,2018-05-10,"My pharmacy outed me to my parents accidentally, now I have problems",Mistress_Impervious,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/8iipqr/my_pharmacy_outed_me_to_my_parents_accidentally/," I already posted a similar post to r/ legaladvice yesterday, but this community is very specific for my situation. 

Three years ago I came out as trans to my parents. At the time (summer 2015) I thought it would go well, it did not. I was in a 2 week long argument, and was constantly verbally abused. I went back in the closet a month later, then went off to my freshman year of college. I came out again in late 2016, and even was attending sessions of a gender therapist. My mother took it better, but convinced me that I was wrong and I was being ripped off (tbh $60 a session is highway robbery). Ultimately I went back in the closet to her again. 

I transferred colleges and found that they offered 12 free therapy sessions a year, and I was golden. So spring of 2017 I started therapy about my entire life and my gender dysphoria. The therapist, and myself, wanted to talk over this as much as possible, in order to 100% confirm that I was actually trans (no shit). 

But fall of 2017 o stopped therapy when I met a girl, and gave being a guy one last chance.  My parents were more proud of me than at any other time in my life, and I kinda felt good, but the female part of my brain was eating me alive. 

So I broke up with that girl and went on hormones. I've been on HRT since February, behind my parents back. My mother has been paying my car payment and giving me around $100 a month in spending money since I quit my job (I was on academic probation for working to much), and I've been going behind her back and using that money for HRT. 

So now since they know I'm trans, my dad hasn't spoken to me, and my mother has done nothing but tell me how much of a failure and disappointment I am to my family. Its mean, but I have tough as fuck skin when it comes to being name called and abused. I love my family, mainly just my 5 brothers, and I don't want them to stop helping me, because my internship starts in a few days but I won't have money for a couple weeks. How do I go about not destroying my life further?"
8iiyax,2,2018-05-10,[M4M] Show me what a real man is,wargtail,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8iiyax/m4m_show_me_what_a_real_man_is/,"Basically, I'm interested in a rp where I think I'm better than you, only to get kicked off my high horse and shown exactly why that isn't the case as you turn me into your bitch. I'd prefer no manipulation/transformation/etc, just cold hard truth: you force/get me to suck your cock and then use me as you see fit to get off.

Possible roles for this include:

- I'm your boss's cocky business student son and I've got an ""internship"" as your manager and now think I run the place. You (and maybe a coworker or two!) lose your patience and corner me in my office...
- You're at your best friend's birthday party, but you'd much rather make a conquest of his slightly younger brother, right under the poor sap's nose, maybe even on his bed.
- Same as above, but I'm your best friend's boyfriend. He's a nice guy, but you've seen my ass and you know it's begging to be used by anyone but a nice guy.
- I'm a rich kid and you're a builder/repairman/plumber etc. I talk down on you, but you're more than confident in your masculinity and know just the way to shut me up.
-We're on the same course, and I've been assigned by the lecturer to help you study since your grades haven't been too good. Even if I'm not trying to act like I'm smarter than you on purpose, you're too horny to study.
- I'm a prince and you're my bodyguard, and you're getting tired of watching from behind as I get my way. You've seen the way I've glanced at soldiers, and you're going to show me how much more virile a ""commoner"" can be.

Let me know if you're interested in any of these, or even just the idea, let me know and we can work something out. I'm always up for a message."
8ij1l0,39,2018-05-10,How do you know if the company where you're interviewing is women-in-tech friendly?,yourbasicgeek,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/8ij1l0/how_do_you_know_if_the_company_where_youre/,"I’m thinking of writing a (hopefully both fun and useful) listicle with advice from “women who have been there” for spotting companies that really mean it when they say, “We want more tech women here.”

There’s lots of articles about negative things that should scare you away. What are your POSITIVE signs that the company is welcoming to geek chicks? Let’s help other women recognize them (or highlight them to enlightened hiring managers).

These can be (and probably are) small things you notice, even when you’re interviewing. For example:

 * The t-shirts they give out are available in women’s size small
 * Your interview schedule includes more than one woman, and nobody thinks to point it out as exceptional
 * The company benefits include on-site child care, extensive parental leave, or other family-friendly things
 * They actively recruit at women-in-tech events such as the Grace Hopper conference

I’m not planning to quote anybody; it’s the takeaways that matter, not sources. The most I might do is a first-name-anecdote (“Irene once interviewed for a programming internship, where this happened…”). I’ll take hearsay too (“My friend applied for a job where…”), because again I think it’s the “good ideas” that matter rather than fact-checked attributions.

What should I include? And why would you consider that item a heartening sign?

I’m reaaaally excited but I’m also extremely concerned about how to come out of the program as employable as possible. I already have a B.A. that was kind of a bust so I’m very very worried (I work min. wage atm). I’m unfortunately not eligible for co-op programs through my school (something about year entry rules). Any advice on what I can do to make sure I’m employable by graduation? I’m using this summer to brush on my math skills and learn java and python for 1st year. I found a few internships or programs targeted at first years (g-engineering, Microsoft explore, etc.) and I’m wondering what I can do to make myself as competitive as possible for these programs. If you could give me some advice I would reaaaallly appreciate it. If anyone knows any other first year internships or programs I should look into that would be cool too (I’m 27 atm so idk if these programs usually have age limits...). I’m a dual US/Canadian citizen but I’m going to be in Canadian uni if that makes a difference. General advice just going into my program would also be truly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
8ik6pp,20,2018-05-10,First Internship,rxqueen3,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/8ik6pp/first_internship/,"A little bit of background about myself:  I’m a non-traditional student, I started at a community college, and I switched from ChE to Civil.  So in terms of credits I’m a junior, but I feel really lacking in my civil engineering knowledge.  I feel like everyone else knows so much more.  

Anyways it’s my second day at my internship.  I had just gotten the plans to the project I’ll be working on, and the engineer overseeing the project asked me to figure out how much sub-drain would be needed on one of the ramps.  I just finished my first class that introduced me to Civil 3D, and they use Microstation.  I tried to see if I could figure it out, but I don’t know if I was just overwhelmed at my first task or what, but I couldn’t figure it out.  So I approached him and said I just didn’t know how to do it.  He said he’d go over it with me and talk about approaches.  This being my first internship, I’m not sure I’m experienced enough for this.  Should I have waited before trying to get an internship?  Any advice on internships?"

This kid comes from a rich family, he does not appreciate anything and he keeps talking and talking, it disrupts my work.  Im getting so annoyed by him honeslty. What should I do? My bosses havent asked me for my opinion lol so should I be like he does not have that much interest on working here or just leave it alone and work miserably?"

I am confused which one is better. Suny has a good campus, is way cheaper and the course is completed in 1.5 years. Whereas Poly is in the city where there are more job and internship opportunities. But it doesn't have any campus and would take double the amount to graduate from here against sunny.
I even heard that many of the suny faculties have left and its been difficult to get the courses of your choice since then.

8il1w5,4,2018-05-11,I’m a walking oxymoron,ryanm1903,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8il1w5/im_a_walking_oxymoron/,"I should probably preface that I didn’t develop depression until well into my 20’s, which seems old by some of the other posts here. I went to undergrad and studied theology, and eventually lost my faith. I went to grad school to study clinical psychology, and worked toward becoming a marriage and family therapist, and developed this mental illness. I often find myself thinking about how glad I am that I didn’t study urology or my dick might have fallen off.

Back in 2014, I was halfway through graduate school. I had three jobs. Just trying to make ends meet in the unforgiving economy of Los Angeles. I decided to double my course load so I could finish in one more year instead of two. I was on my way to attend the psychotherapy that was required as part of my schooling. I had been talking with my therapist about my anxiety, about how I felt like I was juggling while walking on a tightrope, and that everything could come crashing down at any moment. I was driving to my appointment, driving through a stale green light and saw a speeding white car out of the corner of my eye. My car was totaled, and I had two compression fractures in my spine. I took exactly one week off before resuming my full schedule, and managed to fit physical therapy in there too. I spent over a year working 105-110 hours a week between school and jobs, all while my spine had multiple fractures. 

I graduated on time with a 3.9 GPA. I left my graduation ceremony and pulled off to the side of the road and wept. Not tears of joy.

My aunt took her life a few months later. She spent the better part of two decades searching for a diagnosis and treatment for a chronic pain condition. She was one of the best, most positive people I had ever known.

Unrelated, a friend of mine took his life not long after. He was a cheerful, life of the party type of guy. California surfer, an infectious laugh and a sense of humor for every occasion. 

Two children I had worked with a couple year prior in a group home, in separate incidents, were shot and killed. One was living on the streets, was shot in the middle of the night and left to bleed out in the middle of the street. He was 19 years old. The other was gunned down by the police. His death was reported in the New York Times, on CNN, there were protests in the streets over another young black man shot by the police... that is, until security footage showed that he had a gun on him. Then everyone stopped caring.

I had broken completely with my religious faith by this point, by that also left me without the coping mechanisms to make meaning out of all this loss. Everyone around me was content to believe that they were all in a better place. I knew better.

Also, during my internship, I primarily did court ordered counseling for domestic violence and other issues. There’s nothing like the realization that even though we teach toddlers that we don’t hit people to solve our problems, I had to get my master’s degree to teach that to a bunch of pathetic grown men in their 40’s and 50’s who couldn’t even admit to what they had done even after a year of classes. Fucking pathetic. I can’t think of a faster way to lose your faith and hope in humanity.

Eventually, my wife and I decided to move to Richmond, VA to be closer to her family and because of a job offer she received. So we moved. We threw away everything we had accumulated over 6+ years of marriage that couldn’t fit into two Toyota priuses, and we drove across the country and moved in with my mother in law. My grandparents, married for 67 years, died a month after we left. A year later, I’m 30 years old and still live with my mother in law, barely holding down a retail job at Target with my master’s degree. I owe more in student debt than I make every month, and can’t afford to move out any time soon.

I’m not suicidal to the degree I was about 8 months ago. I can get out of bed in the morning, take a shower, and go to work... but I don’t know why. I have no idea what the point of struggling to get by, to even try making a difference is. I look around me and see the civilization we’ve built, the incredible technology we’ve developed... and yet we can’t get people to stop beating children and raping women, to stop dropping bombs on poor brown people, to stop shooting or locking up poor black people. Then I realize that none of us will be remembered 100 years from now anyways, and that eventually our sun will burn it and we’ll all be gone anyways, and that eventually the entire universe will entropy into what the Cards Against Humanity punchline refers to as the”inevitable heat death of the universe”. 

All that being said, I’m a “mental health professional”, I should have some greater insight into this disease and be able to treat myself. But it’s also robbed me of clarity of mind. I feel like I’ve forgotten nearly everything I learned in school, and have no way of helping myself, and even if I did manage to live a life without depression, it wouldn’t change the reality that, in the long term, none of it matters at all anyways because, in however many billions of years, it will all cease to exist anyways. In the very end, it doesn’t matter if we were good people, if we helped others, if we saved the whales or fixed global warming or traveled outside our solar system. It doesn’t matter if I get better, or lose weight, or have kids or don’t have kids, or quit smoking, or whatever the fuck difficult challenge I feel some level of pressure to change. To be honest, I’m not sure why I’m even writing this. I’m halfway into a bottle of Irish whiskey and curious to see if some internet stranger has the answer to life’s unanswerable questions

Tl;dr
I’m a trained mental health professional whose life was derailed by depression after a car accident, a loss of religion, a move across the country and 6 deaths close to me. "

My ex broke up with me after conversations with her psychologist 4 months ago and we are having 2 months NC now. She had a chronic illness which causes her to have a lack of energy and high sensitivity to her environment. We had a relationship for 4,5 years and in those years we tried many different solutions and therapists to find a solution.

Her psychologst came up with the idea maybe our relationship could be negative to her illness. They had a few meetings (I did not know that they talked about that) and after the last one she decided to break up. We truly loved eachother and still did when breaking up. She wanted to give me another chance after we walked, but a week later she told me she couldn’t do it due to her emotions thoughts and feelings right now.

I don’t think our relationship was the source of the problems because it was already there before I knew her, but the lack of energy became worse over time. She dropped out of school, stayed home and is in the middle of a moving (she lives with her parents). I was/am busy with my final internship and overworked myself with my company.

I do think these things made her problem worse and I do believe we could have or will resolve this in the future but she couldnt do it now.

At first the breakup came out of nowhere for me and I never begged so much to anyone (yeah stupid but you know, emotions).

After a while I saw what went wrong and this made it easier for me to improve and move on. I do still truly want and think it could work out in the future if the underlying problems have resolved, but I don’t want to hold on to any false hope.

I am doing really well but sometimes there come big but short waves of sadness. It is mainly when I read /r/breakups and /r/exnocontact. Does anyone recognise this? Are there others who think reading these subreddits  stop you from moving on after a while? They helped me a lot in the first 2 months.

8imt0b,3,2018-05-11,"Professionals and business graduate, I need your opinion on this",Hoanyelir,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/8imt0b/professionals_and_business_graduate_i_need_your/,"Hello,

I've recently graduated in Modern Languages in a small university in Italy. The quality of my education is below average but many people (fuck my parents, I'm talking about other adults, real world people) believe I'm fairly intelligent and that I can do a lot more. I volunteered in a number of projects, got to study abroad for a short amount of time and I have many interests. I'm 23 now and I need to start working, however. Never done an internship yet (we tend not to do them here in Italy but at 23 I feel like I can't take this as an excuse anymore).

My problem is that my experiences came in too late. I graduated in that course exclusively because I thought that it was the easiest and shortest way to freedom. I only wanted to get out from my little city and start working. Any job would have been fine. I had no prospect. I was dumb, I know.
I developed an interest for **entrepreneurship** and economics in general while following a crash course in web marketing, which I’m still attending right now (I graduated two months ago). It is poorly made but it introduced me to a number of concepts and well, perhaps my INTJ side finally is coming to the surface, who knows. I want to know how companies come to life, how they survive, how markets work and so on. Eventually I would like to found my own company, I have many ideas. Problem is, Italy is **not** a great place for young entrepreneurs and I don't have a lot of money to spare. Plus I'm scared that without the right knowledge, my chances of making it are significantly low.

This may sound like a giant excuse, but I feel like as I am now even if I started working for a company, **I wouldn't grasp the things I need to eventually be on my own**. I feel like I should get back to university and at least grab another bachelor, while keeping on studying and saving money on the side, trying to get people involved in associations and at least get some following in academic projects. All I did in the past years would be attending classes and burying myself in books. Again, I was dumb. Never again.

**My parents don't have a clue**. They work in the public sector. My mother probably never even wrote a CV, while the last my father wrote must have been in his 30s or something. I do not have a clue as to what I should do.

The thing is, I'm okay with gathering and categorizing knowledge from the web. Studying books on my own, trying to get a grasp of what it is that I have to do and everything. But I feel like I could spend some more time **right now** since I’m young rather than working full-time and spending a few hours in the morning to compensate for the lack of time.

I’m just scared that since I’m 23, getting back to university for another degree is a waste of time. I checked what MAs I could do and none of them really interest me. MAs in marketing require credits in economics which I don’t have, so I would waste a year to get those **anyway**. Might as well enrolling for a new bachelor this September at this point.

I met interesting people in this course, even people older than me, and only now I started to get a grasp of how tough the real world is. I feel like I’m really imprepared right now ‘cause I don’t have any really useful skill. I don’t want to be just another employee. I want to change society, at least here in Italy. Again, I have ideas, but **I need to make them work and I need to know how to make money to make them work and make them become sustainable** (sooo many associations with people who don’t have a grasp of how economy works here, and they all happen to **scatter** as soon as the first difficulties come – I do **not** want to be one of them). But I feel like even if I were to become good at something else and I would enter into a partnership with someone else (who would eventually have the role of managing money, finding new capital and so on) I feel like I would lose control of things. I’m scared of that. I will eventually need to trust someone ‘cause I won’t be able to know everything of my company, but I feel like if I don’t know how to manage it myself, someone might take the upper hand someday.

**Sorry for the rant, but I really need some opinion with some adults. I would appreciate it if you were blunt with me. I need some honesty**.

**A huge thanks to anyone who will spend some of his time to write here**.

**Tl;dr**: please do read everything if you can, but here I go: humanities graduate out of desperation, I want to study economics and management to gather useful skills and get access to professional roles that will help me acquire the practical knowledge to found my own company. I feel like as I am now even if I start working, it will be significantly harder to do all this ‘cause I will have to work full-time and study little by little every day, meanwhile if I were to dedicate the next few years to consistent studying (while perhaps allowing me some part-time job on the side), I would have a better foundation to move on and do shit. What do you think?

EDIT: sorry for the typo in the title.

I've been a lurker for a while, and I now need some advice.

I'm meeting with the director of a BI department about and intern position involving SQL. I have a college degree in Economics and have worked in finance before using some simple SQL queries (although not required for those jobs).

I have some experience with Python, SQL, Excel VBA, HTML, JavaScript, CSS. 

How can I communicate to the director that I know SQL and get that intern position? It's been about 2 years since I've worked in an analytics position, and It's been a struggle finding jobs where I live. I've had interviews for BI Software Engineering and Database Analyst interviews. I really want this intern position so I can get back into the analytics field.

Do you have any general advice?"
8inf6m,5,2018-05-11,Acts Like I Don't Function Without Her.,BrunetteBookworm89,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8inf6m/acts_like_i_dont_function_without_her/,"My mom has this weird habit of acting like I shut off like a robot whenever she leaves the room.  She works a 9\-5 job 5 days a week and seems to think I fall into a black hole or something during that time.  For example she'll come home from work and I'll say something about how the laundry's almost done.  She'll respond with something like ""so that's all you did today was the laundry?""  Um no, how did you get ""I did nothing for 8 hours before this"" out of ""the laundry's almost done?""  Pretty much anything I'm doing when she walks in the door is automatically assumed to be my entire day even if it's something as simple as taking out the trash.  It's not just being ignorant.  She'll start to nag me about how I didn't leave the house all day and ask how she would know and point out that I was actually out most of the day.  There's also little things like I'll get a new shirt and she'll go on about how I never wear that color or style, or act confused when I try a new food, or asks why I want to go to the zoo since I normally like to go to library on Sundays, carrying on like I've been replaced by an alien.  I don't have ocd or anything, but I'm almost compelled to do everything like a routine since my mom gets thrown off by the smallest change.  I'd like to be able to wear flats without having to explain why I'm not wearing boots.  She doesn't have Alzheimers or dementia since she's done this since I was a toddler.

My job has a rotating schedule\(substitute teacher\) so there's always times where I'll have the entire day off or just a morning or afternoon shift.  She'll act confused if my car looks like it's been moved on one of my days off like there's no reason why would I use my car if I wasn't at work.  My biggest pet peeve though is when she'll make comments about how I never see my boyfriend or talk to him on the phone.  I'll point out that I see him several times a week and she'll usually say something about how she never sees him.  Same thing with my friends.  I'm constantly pointing out that she's always gone all day and why would I invite my friends or boyfriend over in the evening when my mother is around rather than during the day when we'd have the house to ourselves?  I've also pointed out that I go in my room when I'm on the phone so I can have some privacy.  It's been an ongoing argument for years.  She's even suggested I break up with my boyfriend because *she* never sees him.  The last time was when she claimed we didn't spend Valentine's Day together when we actually hung out the entire afternoon while she was at work.  Because he wasn't at the house when she got home, she assumed I didn't see him at all.  I even got annoyed and told her that every time she tries to start up the ""you never see your friends and/or boyfriend argument, she's basically complaining that I don't let her watch my every interaction with other people.  I actually try to avoid introducing her to my friends and people I date because she's super nosy and will try to create drama.  She'll try to get me to gossip to her about my friends and ask personal questions about them and then assume I don't talk to them when I tell her she's being intrusive.

She's also tried to get me to quit every job I've ever had.  I'd literally get a cashier job and a week later she'd start telling me it wasn't going anywhere because I haven't been offered a promotion yet and I should start filling out applications.  She pretty much tries to get involved in the application process as much as possible.  She'll actually take my paperwork if I leave the room and fill out about 3/4 of it herself so then I end up having to turn in stuff with two different hand writings which to a potential employer just looks like I'm lazy or need help with simple tasks.  She'll go on about how there's so much paperwork even if I'm the one filling it out and tries to convince me it'll somehow get lost or the email won't send if it's online stuff.  In the end she'll act like she caused me to get the job when she actually just forced stress into something I would've finished quicker on my own.  Once I have the job and settle in, she suddenly has a million reasons I should quit.  Basically it's like she loses a source of entertainment when I have a job and everything's going well.  It was annoying enough with all the retail jobs and temporary internships, but now that I finally got on a permanent career path and am actually scheduled for a promotion this month, it just feels like sabotage.  She's been nagging me nonstop since January about applying for a second job while the schools are on summer break and I've been asking what she expects me to do about it months before anyone's hiring summer help.

My mom's always tried to emotionally stunt me and although she always nags me about having to live with her because I can't afford my own place, but I think she's secretly dreading the day that I'm gone.  She's a major gas lighter.  Super nice and a complete enabler to everyone else, but I can barely sneeze without being critiqued.  She'll also get angry at me for the tiniest things.  She has admitted to having ocd and anxiety which factor into her behavior.  I actually grew up super shy because it seemed like my every move upset my mother.  My child logic just led me to believe that I sucked and was weird and that if I wasn't careful I'd upset other people like my mom.  All the way up until my late teen years I thought that if I didn't stay in the background, people would see my flaws.  Basically my mom expected her child to be like some sort of living doll or a clone of her and was surprised when I had my own personality.  If I had to guess, I'd say she's always seen me as the one person who could never leave her no matter how she treats them and her complaints about my friends, boyfriend, and jobs are because she can't view me as a separate person from her.  In her mind, my entire life is whatever happens when we're in the same room and anything else isn't important because she's not in it.  I think she does love me in her own way and doesn't realize how emotionally abusive she is.  It just frustrates me because her whole thing with needing every detail of my day or relationships otherwise they didn't happen and the way she acts weird when things are going right for me job wise makes me feel like I only exist for her amusement.

Sorry for the long rant.  I just needed to vent since I'm finally getting closer to freedom and I'm not sure how she's going to handle it.  All I know is that once I move out I'm going to thrive so much since I'll no longer feel like a possession."
8innlr,0,2018-05-11,Should I/can I (22m) get past this issue from my (23f) girlfriend's past?,whattodo3949,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8innlr/should_ican_i_22m_get_past_this_issue_from_my_23f/,"My girlfriend and I have dated since the fall. It's been great. I love her. All of that standard issue foundation of how I want the relationship to work and what not. With that said, there's *an aspect* about her past that I find myself hung up on. Before I go on, here's a little disclaimer:

I know the regular problems that people have with the pasts of significant others. I'm not that guy. I know two people personally my gf has been involved with. I know her number. I do subscribe to the idea that the past is the past and it doesn't change how she feels about me now. I don't doubt her feelings for me. I don't think she wants to be with anyone else but me. Jealousy and insecurity are not at play here for me. I don't see anyone else as my competition or think that she thinks about other guys.

Ok. A few months before my girlfriend and I got involved, she hooked up with a coworker while out of town on an internship. I have no issue with this, until I find out that this guy is just not at all the type of guy I expect her to be involved with for any reason. As she explains it to me, she was not in a good place having recently gotten out of a relationship/being sad about it, and being lonely in a city where she didn't know anybody. She said it wasn't about him, and that he was there at the right place and the right time. Basically that it could've been anyone that was nice to her. She said it was a mistake and she regretted it. 

As tough of a pill that is to swallow. I get it. We have our moments. Sometimes there are vulnerable moments. I believe what she's said. But I keep coming back to the thought of them together. The thing is, it's not even the thought of them sleeping together. I think about them hanging out as friends (nothing happened until the end of their time there), and wondering how it could get to that point. I know she said it could've been anyone, but no one's bar bottoms out at the literal floor. The fact is that there was no point when she took a look at him or how he was acting and thought ""yeah that's just not happening."" It's unsettling to me that he met *some sort* of criteria. 

The question that I'm asking is: should I get past this? Can I? How? I want it to not be a big deal. I have been trying to minimize it and be ok with it. I know that I shouldn't feel this way, but I can't seem to shake the feeling that this somehow taints her or makes her seem lesser. I don't want to feel that way. I'd really like a legitimate reason not to that I haven't stumbled upon. Please help. 

In any case please understand I'm just being honest about the way I feel and looking for help. I'm not proud of the way that I feel about it; I wouldn't be here if I had this all sorted.

Thanks.

Edit: As if I didn't say it enough in the comments, I want to thank you guys for commenting. I think that I stand something to gain from all of them in one way or another, and I appreciate you taking the time to lend a hand."

Can someone help with an into question?",PhitPhil,vuejs,https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/8ip745/got_put_on_front_end_devlopment_project_for_my/,"Hi everyone, 

So I have an internship with a data science startup, but they are in need of me to help with UI development, with Vue. I have 0 UI background, and therefore, I'm struggling to get this off the ground. I am taking a udemy course on Vue, but I'm really kind of stuck here, because I kind of have no idea what I'm doing. 

Right now, I have this Vue project, and I'm simply just trying to see how to use the script, which uses typescript, to get data to the page. I'm suppling the index.vue code at the bottom. 

I'm obviously misunderstanding something, probably within the

You love wearing outfits that tease, that barely cover up your skin -- you're an avid fan of thigh-high socks and little mini-skirts. Your body is busty too, so the outfits fit, at least in my opinion. Apparently up in Heaven they don't like that sort of thing, everything's gotta be formal, or you tell me so anyway. Honestly, if an angel as telling me something she could lie and I'd probably believe it. Same goes for you. Oh -- and the other thing that was the main reason you were cast down? 

You're unbelievably horny on a pretty constant basis. You've never had a real cock, since you were always around other girls and you couldn't really get close to anyone up above without being caught and cast down... But you sure know how to use your fingers and pleasure yourself in the mad, heated lusty desires that come on here and there. Your kind side is always apologizing about it, while your juices splatter over the floor while you sit there doing the naughtiest things. You can't resist how good it feels. Pleasure like this is never allowed in Heaven, and you rarely even get a chance to sate your desires. The moment you were cast down was when you were caught... doing these things -- again.

How do I meet you? I'm a college student, living off-campus in a small house with wooden floors, a nice bathroom and a large bedroom, as well as a living room -- somewhere I can live using the money from my internship -- it's nothing much, but it's my home. Coming home one day from college, backpack on my tall back, I unlock my door and step in... It's about 8pm, I was programming late at night again. And there you are, sitting on your bare butt on the wooden floors, in the slight moonlight that shines through a window, thighs spread wide apart... And your juices soaking into the oak. You're panting, recently having had orgasmed on the spot, and now you look at me with a deep dark blush. You had just appeared here out of nowhere, thinking you'd been cast into hell to die, or something... And this would be your last chance to do what you loved most. You weren't expecting to be caught by just... a human.

------------------------------------

Thanks for reading! Send me a PM if you're interested and we can discuss where we go from here! I'm looking for a long-term partner for this, and I'd like to focus on both the sexual urges, but also the (possibly romantic?) relationship between them as she slowly joins the Earth society and learns how to live undercover as her angelic form. Maybe she even offers to clean the house while he's gone, and cook food, in exchange for letting her stay? Though the urges are always coming on pretty often so it should be interesting. Another idea I have is that she could start following him to work, planning to work with him, act as his girlfriend to the others around him... and possibly do some risky sexual play in public with him? I would like to play a dom in this scenario -- but I'd also like a teasing sub who makes me almost unable to resist dominating them.

8ipun9,1,2018-05-11,How is Paediatrician as a profession in India?,Mentor_Club,u_Mentor_Club,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mentor_Club/comments/8ipun9/how_is_paediatrician_as_a_profession_in_india/,"* Name - Dr. Aditya Dixit
* Profession - Paediatrician
* Age - 41
* Gender - Male
* City - Gurgaon
* Industry - Healthcare
* LinkedIn - linkedin.com/in/aditya-dixit-6522397

**Where have you been born and raised? What is your family background?**
I was born and raised in Lucknow. My parents still live in Lucknow. My father was head of department in a college. I have two elder brothers. Eldest is air force officer and elder one is LIC officer based in Lucknow.
My close friends went in different professions such as management, dentist, business person etc.

**Who all had the most influence on you and how?**
I was most influenced by a friend of my eldest brother who got selected in MBBS. I had few discussions with him and decided to pursue medicine.

**Please give us a summary of your career.**
I completed MD from AMU at age 28 and then served in Max hospital in Delhi, Paras hospital Gurgaon before starting my own clinic few years ago.

**Which institutes are best for the education/training of this profession?**
AIIMS is the best institute in India. At the second level, most of the colleges that are attached to renowned government hospitals are very good, because in medicine, experience is more important than theory and famous government hospitals gets the most complicated and serious cases, where doctors must do more with less. Some examples of such colleges are LHMC Delhi, MAMC Delhi, UCMS etc.
And because of this reason, very few private medical colleges are good in India.

**What are the costs associated with the education/training of this profession?**
It varies hugely depending on whether you are joining a government college or private. Tuition per year can range from few thousand to few lakhs of rupees.

**What are the typical entry level jobs in this profession?**
Every doctor must join as resident doctor and serve for few years before becoming consultant.

**What is the range of remuneration one can expect when starting out in your line of career &amp; industry?**

* Starting out &lt; 3 lacs per annum
* 5 years of experience - 12-18 lacs per annum
* 10 years of experience - 24-30 lacs per annum
* 15 years of experience - 30-60 lacs per annum
* 20+ years of experience - 40-60 lacs per annum

* Income starts to plateau after certain time, as there is limit to number of OPD patients one doctor (Paediatrician) can handle in a day. 

**Describe your work? What do you typically do on a normal work day?**
I have defined my own working hours because I run my own clinic. I see patients in morning hours and then in evening hours.

**What are some of the positives, which would encourage someone to consider this career/job?**
More than 90% of the doctors agree that biggest positive of this profession is that we work with clean conscience and therefore live a peaceful life.

**What are some of the challenges that you would want someone to be aware of when considering this career/job?**
There are two main challenges with this profession that one should be aware of.
1. Delayed earnings – Most doctors finish studies in their late 20s, followed by internships and low salary jobs at hospitals. Around 32-35 years of age, does one start earning some decent salaries. This contrasts with other professions like engineering, management etc, where one starts earning good salaries in their mid-20s. So, if a person can’t wait that long due to personal or family reasons, then one should avoid this profession.
2. Ethical dilemma – Most private hospitals in India push doctors to generate more income for the hospital by prescribing avoidable tests and surgeries. This is not illegal but unethical, and several doctors can’t survive long in such situations.

**What kind of person would be happy in your career?**
A person who can wait to earn till she is in her early 30s, want a peaceful life and have moderate aspirations with regards to income and professional growth will be really happy in this profession.

**Given another choice, what would you do differently as far as your professional selections are concerned? Would you pursue another profession or a passion perhaps?**
I had equal interest in computer science. If not medicine, I would have been a computer engineer. However, given a choice, I would select Paediatrician again.

**What would be your advice to students or professionals who are just starting their journey on a path like yours?**
If your primary interest is earning huge money then chose other streams in medicine such as surgery but the down-side of those streams are that they are high-risk, long and odd working hours, balancing ethics with business requirements and very high investment required to open your own clinic.
And if you want to live a peaceful, respectable and good family life, then choose Paediatrician.

Is it wrong if I say ok?",mbacon101,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8iq93p/my_28f_boyfriend_32m_wants_to_fly_together_during/,"My boyfriend \(32M\) and I \(28F\) of 3 years live together and at the moment he supports me financially. He makes a good living working 2 jobs, 42\-55 hours a week with only 1 weekend off a month. I am currently a student in my last year, with no additional income except for what is left of my savings from an internship and loans from this semester. I am currently job hunting and studying for my board licensure exams, which would complete my degree. Until then, I will most likely not be able to contribute to our shared finances apart from small things like food/toiletries as well as other things like keeping up the house, cleaning, meals, etc. We agreed last year that I would borrow less from my federal student loans to save us in the long run, and he offered to make this possible by supporting my living situation. My savings will be going towards my personal bills and expenses \(car insurance, health insurance, licensing exam fees, gas, food, interest owed on my undergraduate debts, personal trips\), but I will have some room to breathe after. I am extremely lucky to have someone who loves and trusts me so much that he has offered to take on the burden of supporting me in order to lessen our debts in the long run.

We both have massive school loans \(each 8\+ years in school\), and have decided to live relatively frugal until they are under control. However, working so many hours has really burned him out, and so we take mini budget vacations every so often with saved PTO hours and our shared travel points. We also have a Southwest Companion Pass in which I fly for free whenever he flies.

I've recently taken some long overdue trips to visit a couple friends in other states, and will also be going on a girls trip this upcoming May with some classmates to celebrate the completion of our degrees. We have anticipated this trip for the last 3 years, and have already booked the non\-refundable flights and airbnbs. Coincidentally, all these trips take place within 2 months of each other, and has created some concern from my boyfriend since I am not contributing financially and should be saving money to pay off my loans. I don't blame him. I feel guilty that I am going off to have fun and catch up with friends while he is at home, working an ungodly amount of hours, and paying for the mortgage and utilities all by himself. However, once licensed and hired \(goal is by July/August\), I will be able to bring in almost the same amount of income \(about 85&amp;#37; of his yearly salary\) and we will restructure our finances to be equal and fair.

Recently I was invited to a bachelorette weekend in October and I can tell he is not thrilled to hear that I might be going on another trip, especially when I should be responsible with my finances and saving to pay off my loans as well as other major costs, such as our potential future wedding. I haven't agreed to go yet, but I am contemplating it since I do believe it would mean a lot to the bride\-to\-be and I would definitely be disappointed if she couldn't make it to my bachelorette party. If this was just for any other trip, I would not be going.

With that being said, he has found a way to compromise, but I'm afraid that it would piss the rest of the bachelorette party off. He wants to use the Southwest Companion Pass to give me a free flight, but this means he will be coming with me, for at least a little while, on the bachelorette trip. He will need a break from work and wants to have his own vacation in the same town, with either his own friends or just alone. He says he would book a different hotel/ airbnb and plans to try to avoid me and the rest of the bachelorette party, other than the flight and ground transport.

I don't mind, since it makes sense to me, especially if we don't end up seeing each other for most of the trip, but I'm worried that it would annoy the bride\-to\-be and the rest of her party. I've never been to a bachelorette party before, but I know that SOs are usually explicitly not invited, and I don't want to ruin that for anyone. What is the etiquette on this? It seems kind of silly with all this hassle, and I feel bad for my boyfriend, who I know will be needing a break from work. Should I ask the maid of honor \(who I don't know at all\) if it's okay or ask the bride herself?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR: Unemployed student close to graduation with major school loans, studying for licensing exams that will result in a job come July/August. Bf desperately needs a vacation and works like crazy to support us, while I go on trips when I should be saving. I got invited to a bachelorette weekend, and bf was not happy about another trip cost until he thought of a compromise that would give me a free flight and allow him to have his own vacation at the same time, but I'm afraid that this will piss off the rest of the bridal party.

Using a normal goniometer I'm getting angles of about 110 degrees with 2 microliter drops. We also have another handheld device that sprays a small drop of water on to the material and then analyzes the size of the drop from the top down and using some equations calculates the angle. Now doing this on a sample that I tested yesterday I'm getting about 95 degrees which is significantly smaller. To test what was happening I took those same drops from the handheld device and looked at them with the goniometer, and the angle measurements were actually pretty correct, despite having larger angles if I put a larger drop down. This doesn't make sense because doing some research it seems that any water drop under 10 microliters (or specifically 2.7 mm in radius) should have gravitational forces be so small they will affect the angle minimally. Does anyone know what could be causing the change in angle? Maybe the handheld device isn't actually using pure water I'm thinking but I'm not sure. Thanks for any help!"

My boyfriend (30M) and I (24F) have been dating for more than a year and a half. Things are going great, and we love each other very much. Also we've been living together for a year. 


But recently we've been having arguments about this one thing – he gets really upset when I'm reluctant to tell things that I'm not comfortable with or when I'm trying to hide them from him, specifically job-related. 



A little bit of back ground : I'm in graduate school and have been looking for a summer internship for the last 4 months, with no luck. Have applied for 80+ companies, got about 20 phone interviews and 5 on-site interviews to no avail. I eventually got an internship at a small no-name company that I'm not really content with, but the journey has been really, really exhausting and it has taken a toll on my self-esteem and confidence. I'd get depressed and feel like a failure. I'd share my failures and how I got rejections with my boyfriend, but it was only easy in the beginning and it was getting harder and harder to share with him simply because it was just painful to tell the story how I failed over and over again as I spend more time searching for internships. But it was not like he was judging me based off of it, he was actually really supportive during the time. 



So after about 3 months of dreaded internship search, I have become reluctant to talk about my progress in the search. I'd just swallow my pain every time I get rejections and hold them onto me, not necessarily sharing them with my bf. 


My boyfriend, on the other hand, is a very successful software engineer who has achieved so much with no college degree. He dropped out of college in his sophomore year and has achieved so much than other people with advanced degrees at renowned universities. I feel just so ashamed to tell someone like that that I can't even find a proper internship as a graduate student. 



Every time he finds out that I didn't tell him I was interviewing at companies and didn't get the internship again, he'd get upset and angry saying things like ""It feels very strange to know you won't tell me some things while we live together and love each other"". And to make it clear, I was transparent about my failures in the beginning, it was just that amount of rejections and time that made me feel like someone is stabbing in my self-esteem and heart every time I have to bring up my numerous failures. It feels like confirming how incompetent I am again.


But he'd get hurt and get sad whenever I'm reluctant to tell him how I failed, and it seems like he doesn't understand my emotions or why I wouldn't share with him.



Am I hurting this relationship by not sharing my 'numerous' failures with my partner? 



TDLR : My boyfriend gets upset every time I wouldn't share my numerous rejections during my internship/job search regardless of my emotion. Any advices?

In the beginning I was beyond excited – although it already took me three months to send back the contract. Eventually, I just kept ignoring the fact that the date kept coming closer.

I am in therapy since last year in October and must admit that I have never travelled to another country or event city alone if it wasn’t for the purpose of meeting someone there. I kept telling myself that I will make it, but right now I am just thinking: Ok, I do not come from a particularly wealthy background, and I simply am not in the position to ""make"" it on my own. I have made a lot of progress, but this feels like the final boss that I am literally unable to beat.

Last week I booked the flight and slowly but gradually the anxiety kept creeping in. I realized that I don’t have enough money to survive. I have about $500 saved in my bank account and will be able to make another $1000 until August, but I realized that I can only actually afford this if I do not spend any money on things – like, buy food, shitty food, and work my ass off. This actually sounded like a plan I could follow, however, today I realized that I cannot manage it this way. My parents, whom I asked to help me out, are quite tight on money themselves and unfortunately cannot help me. A student loan is not something I can consider getting. There is one scholarship that I am applying for, but it would really change anything about the crippling fear of being alone for three months in a city that I have only visited once for a week.

There is so much anxiety going on inside of me. So, so much. I really don't want to cancel it, but I feel like I cannot just ""suck it up"" and make it.

I feel like giving up. And I feel like a loser. I postponed graduating because of the internship and because I did not know what else to do after graduating. On the one hand, I feel like searching for an internship in my home country could be an option. On the other hand, I have this crippling fear of not finding a job if I cancel this opportunity. And I really feel lost, incredibly lost.

My only issue is that I talked to my advisor and the way the business school works, I have to take three semesters worth of accounting classes and it can’t be fit into two, so I’m gonna have to graduate a semester late in fall 2019 instead. I haven’t told my recruiter because I assumed that I would lose any opportunity I might have.

Now that it’s later in the process and I feel that I might actually have a shot at an internship, I’m afraid that me graduating in the fall will revoke any offer I might get.

“It sounds like any reasonable person would have been confused.”  Huddled in the stairwell of S Hall at UC Berkeley, I listened, stunned, as the detective assigned to my sexual assault case (Detective M) attempted to convince me that the rape was an accident. That because it was initially ""consensual enough"" and I didn’t push him off or yell “STOP!”, my assailant was just confused when I told him I wanted to stop and couldn’t continue. I tried to explain that when my attacker heard my refusal, he got back on top of me and told me that he just needed five more minutes and would go slow. When I refused again, he said “Oh come on, I’ll go slow,” and continued anyways. He told me, “See, that doesn’t hurt, right?”. I was shocked, horrified, confused. It didn’t hurt at that particular moment. So, in my shock, and confusion, I froze. I told him no, lay there, and let him continue. I complied. 

Detective M pointed to this as evidence that it wasn’t really an assault, it was just a miscommunication. I emphasized that I then said no several more times after that – each time, my assailant stayed on top of me, and told me he was close to finishing. Detective M still seemed unconvinced. I told him that my attacker had kept touching me sexually against my will the next morning. That when I woke up, he kept trying to have sex with me even when I kept pushing him off and told him no, only eventually stopping when I wrapped myself in blankets and curled up against the wall. That he had gotten into the shower with me, despite me firmly refusing to shower with him several times. Detective M responded derisively: “Oh the shower incident where he didn’t have sex with you?” .

I started to cry, and tried to explain that as my attacker got into the shower with me, I yelled “NO!”. He ignored that, and kept coming towards me. I turned my back and moved to the back of the shower, frustrated, shocked, and wanting to get away from him. He grabbed me, groped me, and attempted to penetrate me and have sex. He succeeded in partially penetrating me. I wiggled away and told him again, “NO!” Thankfully, he stopped then, and made a joke about how he was such a good guy for not “sticking it in me”. 

After I had to justify my traumatic experience to the detective investigating my sexual assault case, there was silence on the line. Then, in a kinder tone, Detective M said “Well, it sounds like you’re telling me some things that aren’t in the initial report, which isn’t a bad thing. Why don’t you come in for a second interview?” After scheduling the interview, I hung up and just sat in the stairwell, stunned. I started to doubt my own sanity and perception of the event. Maybe it was my fault for not being clearer. Maybe it was my fault for not violently pushing him off, or screaming for help. It was my fault for complying.

To it’s credit, Berkeley Police Department has since apologized to me for the behavior of this detective, who was not assigned to the Special Victims Unit but the Narcotics unit. He had never received training in interacting with victims of sexual assault, nor had experience in sexual assault investigations.

I was raped two weeks after I arrived in Berkeley, California, to start my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, last August. In between meeting with professors and evening classes, I stopped for a snack and walked around campus. My assailant, who I will call Zane (appropriately, the fake name he gave me), came out of a campus building wearing a Cal tank top. He approached me and struck up a conversation. He was attractive and charming.
 
As we walked around campus, he told me a series of well-rehearsed lies. Among other lies, he told me he was a part time computer science graduate student at UC Berkeley, while working part time at Google as a software engineering intern. 

As I spent more time with him, some red flags began to appear. We sat near a stream on Berkeley campus, and he became strangely, overwhelmingly physical. He kept pulling me closer to “cuddle,” even when I was obviously uncomfortable and pulling away. As he pulled me down to “cuddle” with him lying down, I began to get nervous. I sat up again and again, and he kept pulling me down. I tried to laugh this off as the quirks of a tech bro with poor social skills. Eventually, I told him I had class and got up to leave. He walked to class with me, insisting that we should get sushi later tonight and that he would stay on campus and wait for me. 

During class, I pondered whether to cancel. But eventually I decided to give him the benefit of a doubt. To not be rude, I decided to go to dinner with him, since he had waited for me on campus for several hours. 

And sadly, the dinner date went very well. Zane turned back into a charming and funny person. He told me more lies. He had graduated from Stanford last year. He told me Google had a great office culture, and had sushi on Fridays. 

So after dinner, when he needed to use the bathroom and charge his phone, I said we could go back to my place. I didn’t want to leave him in downtown Berkeley needing to use the bathroom and without a way of getting home. As I hadn’t been paid yet, I was nervous about paying for an expensive Lyft or Uber back to SF. And he was a fellow graduate student – I trusted him.

Back at my house, he used the bathroom, but didn’t have his phone charger. When I asked how much charge he had, he muttered something about “not much,” then said he wanted to watch something. 

We started watching Futurama. He almost immediately put the computer aside and kissed me. I remember being very reluctant – I had changed into my pajamas, and wanted to just go to sleep. He kept putting his hand down my pants. I kept pushing his arm away. But he wouldn’t stop. Eventually he took off his clothes, and my pants and underwear. I decided to just get it over with as fast as possible – hopefully it would be quick, he would leave, and I could just go to sleep. 

And at first it was ok. Until it started to hurt. As I told Detective M, when I told Zane I needed to stop because I didn’t want a urinary tract infection, he climbed back on top of me and told me “Oh, well I just need five more minutes.” When I refused, he said he would just go slow, and continued anyways. He asked if it hurt. At that moment, it didn’t. Shocked that he wasn’t stopping, stunned, afraid, panicked, angry, confused, I froze, and the words no that doesn’t hurt came out of my mouth. I stayed frozen, and complied, as he continued. I later asked again, and again, to stop. He stayed on top of me and inside of me, and told me he was almost done each time. Afraid, confused, shocked, I complied. I –I am overwhelmed by shame as I write this --  tried to get it over as quickly as possible, trying to minimize the physical damage.

After he finished, I was shaking with anger, and in a lot of pain. I had hoped he would leave after he got what he wanted. But he didn’t. He changed into a different set of clothes that for some reason he had brought with him (?) and sat on my bed. I said he should get a Lyft or Uber home. He said he couldn’t – his phone was dead, another blatant lie. He looked at me expectantly. 
In pain, in shock, worried about money and trying to avoid a confrontation with someone who had just hurt me, I said he could stay the night. 

Absurdly, he held me and comforted me as I cried and shook afterwards. He asked what was wrong. I didn’t know how to explain that I was so angry and sad that he had just hurt me, ignored me when I said no, raped me. So I told him I had just broken up with someone when I had moved to California. Even more absurdly, he was greatly offended at the idea that he was “just a rebound.” 

He stayed the night and slept in my bed. During the night he kept trying to hold me. I kept pushing him off and telling him not to touch me. He ignored me. I didn’t sleep at all not just because of this, but also because of the physical damage he had inflicted as a result of the rape.

In the morning, he rolled on top of me and tried to have sex with me again, and kept sexually touching me even after I said no again and again. He eventually stopped when I wrapped myself in my covers and curled up against the wall.

After I got up, I got ready as fast as I could, trying to be polite, trying to just get him out of my house without a confrontation. He wanted to shower with me. I told him, repeatedly and firmly, no. He seemed to accept this, so I got in the shower. 

But as I was showering, he snuck into the bathroom and threw a glass of cold water on me, laughing as I screamed in shock. He said, “I feel like you’re just teasing me, being naked where I can’t see you.” Angrily, I replied, “I’m really not.” 

A few minutes later, I heard the shower curtain rustle and saw Zane coming towards me into the shower, naked. I loudly said “NO.” He ignored me, came towards me as I turned away, penetrated me anyways. The rest of the morning, he kept sexually touching me. I had given up saying no. I just tried to get dressed, get to class, get through it, pretend everything was normal. I was afraid of confronting this person. I was in pain. I was in shock. I felt dead inside. I just wanted to survive.

He insisted on walking me to class, and held my hand as we walked. When we arrived at class, he gave me a hug, kissed me on the cheek, and then called a Lyft from his “dead” phone that he had not charged overnight. 
	The next day, I visited urgent care with a raging UTI. I told the nurse that I was raped. An advocate was called, and I was told that if I wanted to report to the University, it would automatically go to the police and the district attorney, regardless of whether I wished it or not. I was told that a rape kit, which would take over six hours and require a trip to a distant hospital, would also mean a full scale police investigation. I couldn’t do it.

The next few days, I would visit urgent care again and again for a panic attack and injuries from the attack. My abdomen was swollen and painful for several weeks, and other genitourinary damage took several weeks to heal as well. 
	When I confronted him a day after the rape via text for having problems with consent, he blamed my “wishy washy decision making.” I left him a voicemail, telling him he raped me, but that I wouldn’t notify the university or police. I didn’t want him to get in trouble or send him to jail for years and years – I was thinking about how kind he had been during our date. I felt panicked, confused, and I was in physical pain. I wanted to just drop it, and get over it. After all, I came to California to start my Ph.D. In response, he left me a voicemail, with an elaborate apology for his behavior. 
	About a month later, after struggling with anxiety, depression, anger, PTSD, and insomnia, I connected with Path to Care, an organization that offers support to UC Berkeley survivors. Upon consulting with another advocate, I was informed that, in fact, a report to UC Berkeley would not necessitate a police investigation. And I could refuse to cooperate with a police investigation at any time. It was unclear why the advocate I met at urgent care when I first reported the rape had advised me otherwise.
	I thought about the elaborate apology Zane had left me via voicemail. But then I remembered how he ended his voicemail saying that we had such a great connection. Disgusted, I scheduled a meeting with the UC Berkeley Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD) to start a Title IX investigation.
	Horrifyingly, they told me that he had never been a student at UC Berkeley. 
	I searched and searched. But he had blocked me on all social media platforms, and given me a false name and information. I could not find the person who had raped me. 
	Finally, a friend found him. He had never gone to Stanford, never worked at Google, never been a student at UC Berkeley. He was a third year at the University of W, in Canada. I eventually found out that he had worked at a prominent tech company in San Francisco for a summer software engineering internship, and had been fired four days before he raped me, for inappropriate conduct allegedly against women. 
	Upon learning this, I immediately went to the police to report the rape. Zane’s deception suggested he had planned misconduct from the beginning – his lies made me trust him and let him into my home, but also made it much more difficult for me to find him and hold him accountable for his crimes. 

I also informed the University of W, where he was a student, but was informed that they could not do anything – not even hear my account -- while the police were still investigating. 
When I told Zane I had discovered his lies and gone to the police, via text, he blamed me for everything. He denied the lies, insisted he had been kind and caring. He said he “may have boasted a bit outside of the truth”, but he never lied. He also told me that there may have been a miscommunication and a minor fight, but it was my “fault” for not “amplifying [my] concerns” during the rape. 

He told me that I should never have led him into a “rape trap” when I had a “running infection.” He told me there are “better ways to tell a man you regret him,” and blamed me for leading him on, letting him into my home and into my bedroom if I “wasn’t sure”. He said that I was ashamed that he was “a rebound,” which apparently hurt his feelings and explained some of the motivation for my allegation.

He told me rape was when someone was physically held down, and that he hadn’t done that. He threatened that women like me had gone to prison for making false rape claims. He told me he was a “good man.” And lastly, he told me: “I hope you find a man who is patient with you, I hope you learn to be honest with those you court, and I hope you find a man who will love you the way I thought I would.” 
	I then heard almost nothing from the police for almost a month and a half. I tried to get better. I tried to get sleep, do yoga, exercise, eat well, and study. I baked a lot of things. But it sucked. Every time I showered, I remembered yelling “No”, and seeing him come in anyways, remembered how it felt when he ignored ""No"" and touched me, penetrated me, anyways. Several weekends, I was so tired and overwhelmed that I went to bed by 7pm, exhausted and miserable. I couldn’t pay attention in my classes, distracted by flashbacks and moments of intense anger. 
	At some point, I decided to call the police for an update. And that’s when Detective M not only asked me to immediately recount the intimate details of a traumatic event over the phone, but implied that it was an accident, my oversensitivity, and my fault. 
	The police investigation dragged on for several months. Eventually, a warrant for forcible rape was sent to the Berkeley District Attorney. But, a few months later, I found out that the DA would not take my case, which is not uncommon for these kinds of cases. 
	I was crushed, but kept doggedly pursuing justice through the University of W. But after several months of administrative delays, in part due to the Berkeley police department, the University of W informed me that they could not do a formal investigation, as the rape occurred off campus. Instead, they would do a safety assessment. However, since that was an internal process, they would not be able to tell me what, if any, disciplinary actions would be brought against my attacker. None of this had been clearly communicated to me, and after over five months of waiting, I was devastated. 
	I am doing better now, mostly thanks to the incredible support of family and friends, Path to Care, and therapy. My family and friends listened patiently and kindly for hours and hours, and I am beyond thankful for their love and support. Path to Care at UC Berkeley has also been an incredible advocate and support for me, and I cannot thank them enough. 

But I want to share my experience because what happened to me highlights not only the systemic failures sexual assault survivors still face, but also an incredibly toxic view of women and sex that still persists and has only recently been deemed unacceptable. My attacker made it clear that he considered anything short of physical and violent resistance as consent. He also viewed me letting him into my home, my bedroom and reluctantly allowing sex as a green light for anything he wanted. Attitudes like that of Zane, which rationalize aggressive sexual behavior against women as masculine entitlement, commonly motivate rape on college campuses. Zane also seemed to fundamentally misunderstand what sexual assault is, considering only violent, penetrative, physically coerced sex as sexual assault and rape. However, the Department of Justice defines sexual assault as unwanted sexual contact, including groping and attempted assault. In 2012, the FBI redefined rape as penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus against the victim’s will. However, these definitions are not yet in all state and federal legal codes.

But I also want to share my experience because I never expected that certain things that commonly happen to survivors of trauma would happen to me. That I would freeze, panic, and comply when I was attacked, when “No” was not enough. That I would later blame myself for letting him into my home, trusting him, not pushing him off or becoming violent, letting him stay the night. That my memory of some parts of the rape would be spotty, a side effect of trauma. That I would feel ashamed to say “I was raped.” That I would have trouble sleeping. That I would see him, and still see him to this day, everywhere, in the faces of strangers who resemble him. That when I was reporting I felt a powerful and strange mix of pity, sympathy, and revulsion for this person – he was kind to me. I didn’t want him to go to prison for years and years or ruin his life. But he also hurt me, raped me.
  
Lastly, I experienced some disappointing institutional failures. The Berkeley Path to Care advocate I spoke to when I was in urgent care after I was raped told me that any report to the university or a rape kit would lead to a full-scale police investigation. This would likely result in criminal prosecution that I would have no power to halt. In my experience with Berkeley police department and UC Berkeley, this is not true, and it saddens me that an advocate for Path to Care would not know this or not be able to communicate this clearly during such a critical moment. 

 I do not feel safe at UC Berkeley, which, at this time, will not ban my rapist from campus, even though he was trespassing in a restricted University building when I met him, pretended to be a UC Berkeley student, and then raped me. UC Berkeley OPHD refused to forward my complaint to the Admissions office, even though Zane is a prospective student who has expressed interest in transferring to UC Berkeley as an undergraduate, or applying to the UC Berkeley computer science graduate program. A Title IX investigation will most likely not be initiated if he were admitted, since the rape happened off campus and before he was a student.
 
Furthermore, due to budget cuts, the Berkeley Police department assigned a detective who was inexperienced and untrained in sexual assault investigation and interaction with sexual assault victims to my case – and my interaction with him yielded long-term damage. 

The University of W took over five months to tell me that they might do something, but if they did, I would never know. Apparently, they deliberately obscure the process as part of an official communication policy with survivors – and at least for me, this was excruciating. 

But for me, this is the worst part: studies have suggested between 25-63% of rapists on college campuses commit more than one sexual assault. Despite the astounding lack of precision in this estimate, there are no additional studies on repeat offenders on college campuses, to the best of my knowledge.  Fewer than 4% of sexual assaults reported to the police result in prosecution, and only an estimated 0.007% of all sexual assaults lead to a conviction. Universities still struggle with limits in jurisdiction in their response to sexual assaults, as many assaults by students occur in off-campus housing. Students, like Zane, who are in co-op programs may also face no significant consequences for misconduct committed during their off-campus internships. The delayed and limp response by both the criminal justice system and University of W leaves me with little faith that Zane will face justice anytime soon or modify his behavior. As a result, he will likely hurt others, rape others.

 I wish the systemic failures and misogyny I experienced were an anomaly. But they’re not. So here’s to #Metoo, and hopefully the meaningful change in law and society I hope it will bring.

If it's not allowed, please let me know where I can post this.

I just accepted an offer at AMES research center, and I have tons of questions.

1.) Is there a place very close to the center that offers living quarters for interns and their spouse?

2.) if not, is there a relatively cheap location to stay at for the 10 weeks?

3.) if not, what areas should we avoid getting an apartment at? 

4.) who would I contact for more information on what I should pre-study/prepare for before beginning my internship?

5.) Since this is a 40 hour week, 400 hour internship, does that mean I won't work over 8 hour days, or are the hours a minimum? 

6.) is there anything I should know before starting my internship that previous interns regretting not knowing when they started?

I have so many more questions, but these questions are the most pertinent and important ones.

8it3te,33,2018-05-11,A quick look at Everlane's Air Collection,SrumdawgMirrionare,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8it3te/a_quick_look_at_everlanes_air_collection/,"I'm a college student and just got an internship this summer where the dress code is rather casual. My wardrobe hasn't been upgraded in a while so I decided to check out Everlane for some summer commute friendly business casual clothes. My plan was to create an outfit centered around a white oxford (short sleeve or long sleeve) with a couple of different colored pair of chino's and finish off with a white sneaker like a Jack Purcell.

I wanted to go with Everlane because I had been eying their Travel Pants (now Air Chino's) for some time and figured it would be easier to just get everything else I needed from them. I'm 5'7"" and 140-150lbs (depends on how school is going really). Everything that I got is rather slim cut and size small fit me very well.

I ended up buying:
2x Air Chino's (1 Khaki, 1 Stone) 30x30 $58
2x Cotton Tees (White) Small $16
1x Air Oxford (White) Small $58
1x Air Oxford (White) Medium

Ordering and shipping were fine and pretty straight-forward. I got free 6-10 day shipping but spent $5 more on a quicker option since I would be going on vacation next week and didn't want the box left outside on my front doorstep. I ordered on a Tuesday and a the clothes arrived on Friday.

First impressions of the clothes:

Air Oxford: Everlane ended up sending me two different shirts. One looked like an old model without buttons on the collar and the other was a little thicker and had the buttons. I will be basing my opinions on what looks to be the newer model. Overall, it's alright for what it's supposed to be, a light, breathable oxford. The thin material is pretty comfortable but it is rather translucent.

-&gt;Verdict: I will be returning both exchanging them with Everlane's ""Japanese Oxford"" since they look a bit more substantial. 

T-shirts: Their basic t-shirts are really soft but thinner than I anticipated. I thought the white ones would be thick enough for casual wear but you can see a bit more of my nipple than I'm comfortable with in well-lit areas. Also, you can see where the sleeve ends if I'm wearing them under the Air Oxford which isn't necessarily the t-shirt's fault but something that doesn't look great. 

-&gt;Verdict: I'll be sending these back to exchange for heather grey or a different color so that I can be more confident wearing them under white buttoned shirts and by themselves. I would prefer a heavier weight but the price difference is a bit too much for me to reconcile right now.

Air Chino's: Again Everlane ended up sending me a new version and one from old stock, however the differences between the two aren't immediately apparent. These pants are really comfortable and mostly everything that I hoped they would be. The waist is a bit higher up than I wear most of my pants but I think it looks fine overall. Very light, breathable, and stretchy. My only complaint is that the material can look a bit shiny under some light but overall no complaints with the pants. We'll see how they hold up.

-&gt;Verdict: Pretty good if you can get over their glossy look. May exchange for different colors or the shorts versions and get the midweight chino's.

Overall: Pretty good experience even though I'm sending most of the clothes back. Only downside is either I lose $6 dollars on the shipping back or get the full value in store credit only. There are other options they have that I want to try so I'm not too worried.

8iufdk,3,2018-05-12,Need Advice - UTS for Software Engineering ??,wild_howl,UTS,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTS/comments/8iufdk/need_advice_uts_for_software_engineering/,"Hey Guys,

I am in quite a difficult situation. So, I finished my bachelors of Civil Engineering from UNSW last year \(Nov 2017\). During  industrial training in last year of study , I realized that I was not enjoying the work. So i decided to change the stream and apply for second bachelors degree in software engineering. I wanted to do software initially but due to some reason, I didn't enroll in the degree.

After studying for 4 years at UNSW I am saturated with it and tired of the everyday travel as well \(especially Central to campus and back\) . With the light rail construction, traveling is worse than before.

So I  lodged the application with UTS as my first preference , UNSW as second followed by USYD.

Yesterday, I was looking for software engineering reviews at UTS on whirlpool forums and here on reddit as well. I came across so many posts and comments indicating that education quality of UTS is poor and sub\-par compared to UNSW.  A lot of posts are old though and I don't know current situation.

I know UNSW is one of the best universities in Australia especially in computer science.  I have received an offer from UTS \(in this round\) and I believe I would get one from UNSW and USYD as well in next rounds.

I have a few doubts in my mind:

1\) Is it worth going to UTS for software engineering? especially if you can get into UNSW or USYD as well?

2\) is UTS education really sub\-par compared to UNSW or USYD?

3\) does 'university name' has an effect on job opportunities?

4\) Also, what are your views on the diploma of professional practice? The 1 year internship thingy.

I really want to study at UTS this time as it is closer to home and part\-time work. Also, because of I am saturated with UNSW. But all these posts are driving me crazy.

Phytotherapy: How to use plants

Although there are currently many plants extracts in the form of food supplements that have the triple advantage of being easy to take, of not requiring any preparation effort, and often of offering a controlled content in Active ingredients, it can be a lot of fun to prepare your own herbal remedies (Phytotherapy). It is also in the interest of being able to use any of plants, provided that you have it at your fingertips. Not all plants are found in the form of food supplements. Take the simple example of the fragrant Woodruff: This small white flower that grows in the spring in the undergrowth and which is deliciously scented by drying… It is difficult to get it in capsules or in a tea bag. On the other hand, you only need a walk in the forest and a single harvest to enjoy it all year round!

Harvesting plants

What are you going to reap? Choose plants that you know well and that you are not likely to confuse. Some plants are poisonous. Nature is not always merciful with the picker… Just a few leaves of Laurel-Rose, a little hemlock, datura or digital to do you a lot of harm! The identification of plants is therefore paramount. The ideal, to learn, is to walk with a person keen of botany. There are also many structures, often associative, that offer hikes or even internships to discover the flora and its benefits.
When you have filled your basket with leaves and flowers, what are you going to do with your harvest? First of all, check well, one last time, that you have correctly identified the plants. If necessary, look on a guide to the Flora or, in this book, and carefully compare the descriptions; But, again, there is nothing like doing his pickings accompanied by a connoisseur, at least the first few times.
Depending on the time of flowering, maturity and the parts of plants concerned, harvest times vary. In spring and summer, it is mainly plants, whose active ingredients are concentrated in the leaves, and especially the flowers that are interesting.
Choose a dry and sunny day avoiding the stormy atmosphere. Make your harvest preferably in the morning, when the dew is completely evaporated, or failing in the evening, but before the moisture has fallen. Plants must not be wet, otherwise they may ferment and rot, and lose all their qualities.

The necessary equipment

Sharp scissors and knives are imperative for cutting the rods sharply. To prevent the plants from spoiling, be careful not to crush them: a basket is the best container to deposit your pick. It is strongly advisable not to mix the different plants during the harvest. You can take several baskets, otherwise you only collect one plant during your walk. And most importantly, do not let your crop piled up in the basket when you get home: When you return, take care of your plants.

Where to pick?

The more the place of your picking will be from the urban areas and the crops, the better your harvest will be. Nothing beats a place a little wild. Pay close attention to the plant environment: if there are a few fields in the vicinity that are regularly planted with fertilizers and pesticides, there is no need to linger. Do not pick contaminated plants. Avoid also dust-covered plants that grow along roadsides and roads. We never wash the plants that we collect, so they must be clean when picking.

The basic rules

When picking up or cutting plants, dispose of small wastes (other plants, debris, etc.) before putting them in your basket. This is much easier to do at harvest time than later on. be strict on quality, because the plant must be perfect: wilts, discolorations, leaves nibbled and stains are all faults to be taken into account. Especially since defects are often contagious and you may “condemn” your entire crop.

Dry and keep

To dry the roots, flowers, bulbs, berries and fruits, hang them or spread them without overweight on racks or cratess, usually in the shade in an airy place (e.g. in the attic). If the roots are fleshy, it is better to cut them into slices. The stems and leaves can be dried in the sun. Once your plants are dried, distribute them, without mixing them, in paper bags, envelopes of letters or cardboard boxes. Avoid plastic and metal… and shoe boxes, even new ones (to prevent the plants from absorbing bad odors).

If you grow your own plants

Aromatic and medicinal plants are generally quite undemanding, often those that grow wild in wastelands. They won’t make any trouble to invade your garden! Preferably put them in a place sheltered from the wind. If you don’t want to ask questions, sow and replant in sterile soil. If you are a perfectionist, you should know that garlic, rosemary, alchemilla, marjoram, mint, hyssop, sage, oregano, juniper, laurel, hazel, lime, campanules, poppy, Blueberry and buis prefer a slightly alkaline soil: spread once or twice a year from Ashes of wood and limestone. In addition, Citronella, borage, knapweed, chamomile, thyme, fennel, lavender, and bulbous or tuber plants prefer more sandy land. Therefore, separate these two broad categories.

Planting

They sow as soon as March under a greenhouse or in the House near a window exposed to the south and, after the frosts, in the shelter, until July. Seedlings are usually carried out on a potting soil, spacinging the seeds, and then lightly filling them with the dish of the hand. Most aromatic plants germinate at 15-21 °c within a few days. You will transplant 4 to 6 weeks later. If you have a late sowing, you will leave it in place by spacinging the seedlings. Follow the instructions on the pouch to see how much water to sprinkle or what is the best germination temperature. In summer (June, July), you can make a seedling directly in place (without subculturing).

The Division

Every 2 or 3 years, divide the woody plants (thyme, rosemary, Lavender…) or bushy (sage, Queen of the Meadows, chamomile, St. John’s Wort, Mint…): It is enough to clear the Earth on one side, to separate the roots by hand, to replant and to water.

Cuttings

It’s pretty hard to succeed, but it’s worth a try when you have no seeds or roots: cut it in a neat, slanted way, about ten centimeters above the hard part of the stem. Remove the leaves on one third of the stem. Plunge the cutting into the water, wait for it to produce roots, and then replant it in a pot with potting soil. Before fall, replant in the middle of the earth.

Potted culture

Most medicinal plants (basil, lavender, rosemary, serpolet, hyssop, mint, parsley, queen-of-Meadows, St. John’s Wort…) can be grown in pots. The larger and deeper the container, the more the plants will spread. If you grow your plants inside, make sure, on the one hand, that the room temperature does not exceed 18 to 19 ° and, on the other hand, that the plant has natural light at least 8 hours per day. Herbal remedies generally do not appreciate draughts, think about it when you decide on the place you reserve them in the house.

Herbal Teas

What if I told you that nothing would ever replace a good herbal tea? It’s true, it’s a little time, you have to heat water, wait until it boils or it infuses, but frankly, it’s worth it! Because while you’re “caring”, you drink! Good water loaded with active ingredients. Moreover, even if, a few years ago, the herbal teas were relegated in the “Grandma” ray with a slight contempt, they are again in the stern.
You can choose a single plant or mix them, depending on the tastes or effects you are looking for. Apart from some recipes coming from famous herbalists, I took the party, in this Bible, to propose simple herbal teas according to the indications: Linden Flowers against the flu, Hawthorn in case of palpitations, dandelion roots for the liver … But each time, many plants can be useful and it is quite possible to mix them.
To do this, you have to choose plants or parts of plants that can be prepared together: if you put roots that must be boiled to extract the active ingredients with flowers that only support the simmering water, this will not be appropriate Not. For example, queen-of-meadow flowers should not be boiled with burdock root: The Queen of the Meadows would lose many of its active ingredients during the boil.
In case of rheumatism, for example, you can mix the leaves of blackcurrants and flowers of queen-of-meadows equally and drink 3 cups of herbal tea a day (1 tablespoon of the mixture infused 10 minutes in a cup of boiling water). If you have skin problems, boil 40 g of a burdock root mixture and wild thought for 10 minutes and then infuse 5 minutes before filtering. Drink the mixture in the daytime. If you are preparing enough herbal tea for 1 or 2 days, keep it cool and, depending on your taste, make it more or less warm when you drink it.

What you need for your preparations

Carefully choose your equipment by preferring enamelled pots and wooden spoons. The less plants are in contact with metal or plastic, the better.
Avoid aluminum utensils and containers that can be toxic and that the plants absorb. To preserve your herbal teas, prefer cardboard boxes or glass stoppers that you store in the shelter of light.
Depending on the plants and especially the parts of plants used to make their herbal tea, the method of preparation is different. Infusion is well suited to flowers and leaves in general, the most fragile parts of plants. The decoction is mainly used for roots, stems and barks.
The water used must be as pure as possible and weakly mineralized, such as spring water or, better still, osmosis water. Avoid tap water. We often have the habit of drinking herbal teas in the evenings, but they can accompany the days. Why not take the habit of drinking 1 liter of herbal tea between meals, for example? By varying the mixes according to your tastes and the effects you expect.

The Brew

It consists of pouring boiling water on plants at the precise moment when the water boils. You then put the plants in the water, stir lightly and cover the pan. Then allow the necessary time (from a few minutes to 1 hour depending on the plants) to brew. You can beat with a tea whip (bamboo) or a wooden spoon to speed up the diffusion of active ingredients. When the brewing time is enough, filter and drink. You can eventually sweeten with honey, but the ideal is still the “pure” herbal tea, unless you have a sore throat. In this case, honey will be ideal. Prefer bulk plants rather than tea bags that often contain “crumbs” or even plant dust.

The decoction

In this case, it is a matter of putting plants in cold water and then heating up the water to the boil. The boiling time can range from 2 minutes to ½ hour depending on the selected plant (or plants) and the hardness of the plant parts used. Then you leave or not brew, always holding a lid on the pan. And of course, we filter before we drink.

The maceration

The plants are left to soak in a liquid: water, alcohol, oil, honey, wine, vinegar, etc., for a period of at least 15 days. The preparations obtained are a little more complicated, but keep longer. So we can always have it on hand.

Other preparations, to buy or to do at home

The juice

You have to reduce the plant to puree. It is better to do it with fresh plants, but sometimes – when the plant is too thick or gives little juice – it is necessary to cook it in a little water. Once the pulp purée is obtained, filter and drink the juice diluted in a little water or use it in compress. This method is rarely used because the “product” obtained is often very bitter and does not retain.

Compresses and Poultices

Compresses and poultices are mainly used in cases of skin problems, sprains, fractures and muscle or joint pain. Use only perfectly healthy plants. You can associate them with vegetable oil (olive oil, for example) or clay or honey according to the different recipes to follow scrupulously. Avoid compresses and poultices on the belly. Proceed in steps: Leave in place for 20 minutes. Start again 2 hours later with a new compress and leave 30 minutes, etc. Never reuse a compress or poultice. Throw them absolutely.
• Compress: A compress or a clean cloth is soaked with a concentrated infusion or a plant decoction, then applied to the skin and maintained by a bandage.
• Poultice: The plant can be applied directly to the skin when the leaves or flowers are fine. Otherwise, they can be heated in water or lightly crushed to the rolling pin so that the active ingredients penetrate faster. Hold with a cloth or a strip. Medicinal wines It is a matter of making macerate the plant fresh or dried in wine (white or red, but preferably organic) for a few days to several weeks according to the “Recipes” before filtering by expressing well the saps of the plant. These wines can be kept for several months at the expense. In general, a small glass of medicinal wine is drunk before or after each meal, as an aperitif or as a digestive.

Syrups

Infusions or decoctions with added honey or unrefined sugar allow to make syrups that can be preserved for up to 1 year. Just mix ½ liter of brew or decoction to 500 g of honey or sugar and heat on a low heat stirring until you get a syrup. Then it is consumed as a commercial syrup, diluting it to 1 tablespoon in a glass of water or, better, in a herbal tea. With some fruits and vegetables, you can also make cold syrups. This is the case, for example, of the numerous Antiall syrups based on black radish, turnip, carrot, onion… A few slices of the vegetable in a plate with a little powdered sugar and the juice is formed naturally.

Medicinal Essential oils

Applied in friction on the skin, plant oils are most often used to relieve rheumatism or improve circulation, or even to soothe burns, itching… It is used, depending on the case, the dry or fresh plant, in pieces, which is put to macerate in olive oil. To improve the extraction, the oil must heat up, without reaching a temperature too high. So we use the Bain-marie or just solar energy.
Wines, oils and syrups should be placed in tinted glass bottles and kept free of light in a cool place.

Mother Tinctures

These alcoholic plant extracts, very concentrated, are often very practical to use (a few drops in a glass of water morning and evening). Until recently, pharmacies were readily available, but they seem to be getting more and more scarce, hence the importance of learning how to prepare them. After all, you are never better served than by yourself!
To make a mother tincture, the dried or freshly chopped plant must be macerate in a strong alcohol (brandy, rum, vodka) as pure as possible in a jar. You can also use a mortar and a pestle to first crush your plant carefully. You then put the plant and its juices in the bottom of a jar and you cover with alcohol. Leave Macerate 2 to 3 weeks, shaking the jar well firm every day. Then filter the maceration, finely, by pressing strongly to recover all the juices. Then pour in small tinted vials on which you paste a nice label with the Latin name of the plant and the date. The dye is preserved for several years.

Homeopathic remedies

Once you have the mother tincture, you can create your own homeopathic remedies: you put 1 drop of mother tincture in a vial. In another vial, you mix 10 cl of strong alcohol (whisky, cognac, vodka, brandy…) and 50 cl of pure water (type Mount Rocous or osmosis). At the drop of mother tincture, you add 99 drops of the water-alcohol mixture. You seal the bottle and you shake. Count at least 100 shakes: you get 1 ch dilution. Take 1 drop of this dilution, add 99 drops of the water-alcohol mixture, you get a 2-ch dilution, and so on until the selected dilution.

The glycerinated macers

These are plant bud extracts. The plant is macerer for about 3 weeks in a mixture composed of one third of alcohol, one third of glycerine and one third of pure water, shaking the vial every day, then filtered and stored in a dark place, in vial of tinted glass , if possible.
The floral elixirs close to homeopathy, the therapy by the floral elixirs is intended to rebalance our emotional system. This method uses remedies developed from mother tinctures of plants strongly diluted in alcohol. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Dr. Edward Bach created 39 remedies, mostly stemming from flowers, or the expression ≪ flowers by Bach ≫. Other researchers have since developed other remedies from other flowers, which is why the expression floral elixirs is now used.

You can also make them yourself, by preparing a mother essence, to dilute according to the needs. To prepare an elixir, you have to choose your season, which will necessarily be sunny. In a bowl, pour 2 litres of water and cover the surface with fresh flowers of the chosen plant, Évitan to touch them too much. Leave this bowl exposed in the sun for a morning or afternoon of great sunshine, then filter and pour enough liquid in a vial to fill it half, then complete with cognac (bio, if possible!). You can sacrifice the rest of the maceration. To make your elixir, pour 30 ml of cognac in a small vial of tinted glass and add 2 drops of your initial mixture of maceration and cognac (to be kept in the shade and cool).

Essential Oils

Essential oils are oily, volatile and fragrant products, secreted by aromatic plants. They are extracted by water vapour distillation or simple cold expression so that the active principles are perfectly preserved. Extraction requires a specific material and therefore difficult to do at home. On the other hand, the use of essential oils, powerful concentrates of plants, is relatively easy, provided never to exceed the recommended doses. For this, I invite you to refer to the numerous works of Danièle Festy, specialist of the subject.
Essential oils are used internally: 1 to 3 drops in 1 teaspoon of honey. But they are mainly used by external means: Massage (in combination with vegetable oil and Essential Oil), inhalation, dispersion, bath, etc. Essential oils are bought in pharmacies, parapharmacies and natural products stores. Choose from organic farming, with the AB label.

Food supplements

There are also many “ready-made” products marketed in pharmacies, parapharmacies, natural products stores or mail order sales. Again, when you have a choice, prefer the brands that have the AB label (organic farming). You will find capsules, tablets, liquid extracts, pure or mixed plants. Remember to always accompany their intake of a lot of water."
8ivfnk,494,2018-05-12,Why Hamburger SV might go down for the first time today. A fan perspective.,jbtum,soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8ivfnk/why_hamburger_sv_might_go_down_for_the_first_time/,"**A short history of the club**

Hamburger SV came into existence after a merger of SC Germania, Hamburger FC and Falke 06 in 1919. SC Germania was founded in 1887, which is viewed as the official foundation of the club.

Ever since the merger in 1919 the HSV has always played in the highest possible league and was never been relegated. 99 years of top flight football. It is the only remaining founding member of the first Bundesliga to never have been relegated. 


**The decline**

*Papierkugel*

There are many starting points for our decline, which I could have chosen, but for me it started with the “Papierkugel”. We had the famous Derby-weeks against our arch rival Werder Bremen in 2009. Within a short period of time, we played in the semi-final of the DFB Pokal, the semi-final of the UEFA Cup and in the Bundesliga against each other. 
Before these matches we were in the title contention for the Bundesliga. After these matches we felt humiliated. 
The symbol of this humiliation was a paper ball. In the 83rd minute of the return leg, in the UEFA Cup semi-final, our defender Gravgaard wanted to pass the ball to our goalkeeper. But the ball hit a paper ball, which lay on the field. The football jumped in the air and Gravgaard failed to hit the ball properly and Werder Bremen got a corner and they scored. Hamburg managed to score once more, but it was not enough. Despite winning the first leg away 1-0, we lost at home 2-3 and were eliminated on away goals. We also lost in the DFB Pokal (on penalties) and the Bundesliga against Bremen.
This humiliation lead to an overreaction from our management. Our coach Martin Jol wanted to gain more power. He wanted to have a management role similar to Premier League managers. In return, this meant that our sporting director Dietmar Beiersdorfer should have given away some power. Hamburg did not fulfil Jol’s demands and so he resigned.
Later on, in the summer break Beiersdorfer got in a fight with our president Bernd Hoffmann and also resigned.
Objectively we played a very successful season, but the club was left in shambles after it.


*Who wants to be sporting director?*

Hoffmann needed to find a new sporting director and a new coach. As a coach, he hired Bruno Labbadia. After a successful start in the league (top of the table and the last win against Bayern to date), our form declined. Nevertheless, we made it to the semi-final of the (renamed) Europa League. But because of poor form in the league and the fear that we could miss the chance of playing the Europa League final in our home stadium, Labbadia was fired. We missed the final anyway, because we failed to beat Fulham. In the league, we also failed to reach one of the precious Europa spots.
In the meantime, Hoffmann found a new sporting director. Urs Siegenthaler, head of scouting at the DFB. However, after coming to an agreement in February 2010, he decided three weeks prior to the start of the new season to give in to the external pressure and not start his job in Hamburg. It was criticized that he could not remain in his position at the DFB and work in Hamburg at the same time. So, he remained at his old job.
Hoffmann then employed the former player and intern in scouting Bastian Reinhardt as an interims solution.
After an average season in 2010/11 HSV achieved 8th place, missing Europa once more. Hoffmann was still on the hunt for a sporting director and after failing to hire Matthias Sammer (rumor has it that Uli Hoeneß called Sammer to tell him to decline, as he wants him in Munich at a later date), he hired Frank Arnesen from Chelsea as sporting director. Hoffmann was a president, who saw potential in growth if you invest money. He promised Arnesen a certain amount of money to invest with. 


*New president, new financial strategy*

But this is when our supervisory board decided that it had enough and fired Hoffmann. Our new president was Carl-Edgar Jarchow, a local politician. He was quite the opposite of Hoffmann. Arnesen was only allowed to spend the money he was making in selling players. Having to throw away the plans he made, Arnesen bought and loaned several players from Chelsea II, his previous position as a sporting director. Hamburg ended up in 15th place in the league.
The season after, things were looking up and we reached 7th place in the league. But for some reason Arnesen was constantly under pressure and criticized. Supposedly, he was still seen as Hoffmann’s man and the supervisory board wanted to get rid of him. Arnesen left on mutual terms. New sporting director was Oliver Kreuzer, who came from Karlsruher SC.
The next season (2013/2014) we had our worst season, but somehow managed to reach the relegation play-offs with only 27 points. We played Greuther Fürth and after a 0:0 at home and a 1:1 away, we managed to stay in the league. 


*A new Era? HSV Plus*

Many supporters had enough of our supervisory board and president Jarchow. An initiative which outsourced the football department from the main club and opened it up to investors was successful. A new era was supposed to begin. Lifelong fan and billionaire Klaus Michael Kühne bought shares of the club and bought the naming rights of our stadium. He returned the former name “Volksparkstadion”. Our new president was Dietmar Beiersdorfer, our former sporting director. Unsuccesful sporting director Kreuzer was fired and replaced by Peter Knäbel.

All the investment money from Kühne was practically burnt. Again, we somehow managed to reach the relegation playoffs once more after Bruno Labbadia returned as a coach. Opponent was Karlsruher SC. After a lucky draw at home (1:1), we needed to win or a high draw to stay in the league. In the second half of the return leg, Karlsruhe managed to score. We needed a goal and were fighting for our lives. We missed several clear chances. In the 93rd minute we were awarded a questionable freekick after a handball. Marcelo Diaz and Rafael van der Vaart were taking aim. Van der Vaart wanted to become a club legend and told Diaz not to shoot. Diaz on the other hand just replied: “Tomorrow my friend”, and scored. In extra time, we scored once more and secured our position in the first division.

In the following season, we reached 10th place. Again, resulting in the firing of the sporting director Peter Knäbel, who had a difficult standing with the media. Especially after having his rucksack stolen with confidential data and the press mocking him for having lost it.
Beiersdorfer was not able to replace Knäbel after an unsuccessful first half to the next season (2016/17). He was also fired in the winter break and replaced by Heribert Bruchhagen, former president of Eintracht Frankfurt. Bruchhagen managed to calm the waters. He hired Jens Todt as new sporting director. The club managed to stay in the league after beating Wolfsburg on the last match day and sending Wolfsburg into the relegation play-offs.


**The current season**

*Same old, same old*

Bruchhagen, confident after the second half of the previous season, did not see the point in investing into the team. After a good start (2 wins in a row), we dropped down and found ourselves once again in relegation battle. Bruchhagen and the supervisory board were again reluctant to invest in the winter break. After the winter break elections for the president of the registered association (non-football departments) took place. One candidate: Bernd Hoffmann. He won by a slim margin. The president of the registered association has a seat in the supervisory board of the football club. 
After the club fired the coach Gisdol and hired Hollerbach (a former player and fan favourite), Hamburg only managed to gain 3 points out of 7 matches. Supporters were angry and started threatening. Hoffmann wanted change. Hoffmann wanted out sporting director Todt gone. Bruchhagen was the only one with authority to do so and declined the motion. Hoffmann then led the supervisory board to fire Bruchhagen, so that the deputy Frank Wettstein can fire Todt. After losing against Bayern 6:0 coach Hollerbach was also fired.


*A new hope*

Youth coach Christian Titz became our new coach and started implementing a new style of football. After experiencing long balls and defensive football for several seasons now, it was more than refreshing for the supporters. Titz plays a possession game, which brought the player confidence and the supporters nice football to watch. An 8-point deficit has now come down to a 2-point deficit. 

Surely there are more points to mention, which played a role, the influence of the investor Kühne for example (who also rescued us financially to be honest), the regular changes in coaching staff (there are already enough names in this wall of text), us supporters, the media and so on... 
But today might be the day that we go down for the first time and I wanted to share the story and especially talk about the pain we supporters went through in the last couple of years, only to stand up again and again. Yesterday 2000 supporters went to training to support the team. The team and Titz somehow made us believe again.

We are 2 points behind Wolfsburg, who play relegated 1.FC Köln today and need just one point, due to better goal difference. We play Borussia Mönchengladbach, who fight for a spot in the Europa League Qualifiers. We need to win. The odds are against us. But we are the HSV, the dinosaur of the Bundesliga, we can’t go extinct… right…?

TL:DR HSV had shit management, became the laughing stock of the league and now they might go down.

We have been dating for about 6 months. One great thing about this relationship is that I truly feel she shares everything with me. She moved to the area where I lived (before we met) for an 8 month internship, with plans of going home. We met, and the decision all of a sudden became stressful for her. Our relationship grew stronger, and eventually she decided she wanted to stay here. She’s very qualified out of college and has been applying to jobs here. Shes heard back from many in this area (~10 no offers yet, just moving further in the interview process) and the past two weeks she’s been interviewing and doing cases like crazy. 

She’s also super homesick. Her family and all her friends except me are across the country. Yesterday she told me she didn’t want to freak me out, but she has been second guessing her decision to stay here. Long story short(er) she put the odds at 70% stay 30% move home. 


Her timeline is 1 more year of work then law school. I told her (and still feel this way) that the way I see us staying together is if she spends a year here. Our relationship continues to grow stronger. Then I could see myself applying to a position and us moving in together during law school. If she moves home, we would breakup. 

I hate that I have to go back to wondering if we will be together or we will breakup. I have been so happy the past few weeks when her mind was made up to stay here. Mostly looking for some support. And how to cope and move forward at this point.

Thanks for taking the time to read this everyone.

TLDR: Girlfriend of 6 months is second guessing whether staying in the area where we both live is the right decision for her. She’s considering moving home across the country (we would breakup). I’m looking for advice to cope and move forward from here"
8iwe6y,5,2018-05-12,IT job market,aiaminhavidafadasse,Netherlands,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/8iwe6y/it_job_market/,"Hi.

I'm portuguese, 20 years old, and I'm planning moving to netherlands (Tuil), in a year, because of my girlfriend and because I know it's a good country to live in.

I have a professional course of 3 years (it is not a degree and was not obtained in a university), focused on software development (.NET, Java, SQL, PHP), databases (specially relational: SQL Server) and so on... I'm now in a internship at a well known telecom company here, as a SQL Server DBA. I will not stay there because I want to go for software development.

Basically with a degree, I would have a lot of maths, theory, very low level concepts, etc... This course is focused not so much in the technology itself, but on the market and its needs, to prepare students for enterprise environment and prepare them to adapt to new changes.

My questioni is: do you think I would get a job as a Junir Dev or something like it? I used and will probably use C# and Java, so I would propably go with a one year exp in ASP.NET, SQL or Java, but feel confortable to learn any language.

I do like front-end, but if I could I would like to stay at beck-end dev.

What are the languages and technologies that have more demand in there?

And in therms of salary, what should I expect?

And the possible locations that my girlfriend told me would be something I could go in a bus or train, 1 hour from Tuil, at least for now.

Amesterdam is really far from where I will be living.

Btw, I talk 0 Dustch (I do want to learn it), I know poruguese (native) and english."

I'll try to make this as concise as I possibly can. 

**My Background**: 

I come from a rather poor family, with my current income from my internship being the bulk of our income right now. My mom receives an SSI check of roughly 800, and my current income is 870 after taxes every two weeks. My dad got laid off from his job and has been stuck in that phase ever since. I'm about to graduate college and have a job lined up with the company I'm interning for and will receive 40k annually if I'm hired (very strong chance). I have about 46k in student loan debt. My house needs a lot of renovation but is structurally very strong. I am only looking at staying at this job for about two years while I start working on alternative revenue streams such as voice acting and selling collectible trading cards online. My mom is attempting to enter the workforce again now that she is feeling a little stronger physically, and my dad will hopefully finding work soon.

**My Problem**: 

I want to start living on my own at some point but I recognize the need to be conservative with the money I do earn, and I want to be as helpful as possible to my parents who did everything they could to get me through college. I want to start building up a small studio in order to really get into voice acting, but do not have the space in my parent's house in order to actually set up soundproofing and microphone equipment. 

**The Question**: 

What should my plan for the next two years look like? Do I stay home, do I move out? Do I get rid of furniture in my room and set up equipment there? Should I prioritize purchasing a vehicle or relying on my city's expansive but sometimes unreliable public transit options?

Please let me know if you need anymore information from me. 

EDIT: Thanks so much for all of your insights! It's cleared up a lot of doubt for me, knowing that people are in the same boat these days and are able to slowly build the life they want for themselves. I will definitely be considering all of this and figuring out how to best apply it to my situation. Thanks again!"

I hope you’re doing well.  Apologies in advance for the long post.  I’m prepping for the MCAT in a couple of weeks and would love help developing a school list.  My draft list is very long and is included below, and I'd be happy to hear your thoughts on any additions/subtracti.  I’m in a postbac career changer program and am hoping to apply in the upcoming cycle.   I don’t have MCAT scores yet, but with trajectory of my AAMC full lengths am targeting a 508-510.  Thank you! My stats are included below in SDN format…



**1.	cGPA and sGPA as calculated by AMCAS:** 3.56 sGPA (undergrad/postbac), and 3.64 cGPA (undergrad).  Also have a Master’s degree in a social science but not sure how that GPA fits in.  
**2.	State of residence:** From Illinois and went to school in-state, but currently living in PA.  Am in my late 20s, and have lived in three east coast states since college for work/school, so unclear where residency really is.  Have a PA drivers license.
**3.	Ethnicity and/or race:** Caucasian
**4.	Undergraduate institution or category:** Flagship “public Ivy”, with a Bachelor’s degree and a Master’s degree in the social sciences.  
**5.	Clinical experience (volunteer and non-volunteer):** Approximately 100 hours of volunteering split between two hospitals – one in an ER, the other on an inpatient unit, both at large academic medical centers.  Also spent a summer as an intern with a pharmaceutical company focusing on drug development, but not really clinical work. 
**6.	Research experience:** No clinical research work, but am co-author on a published economic research paper on distributed ledger technologies and was main editor on a group thesis during grad school.  
**7.	Shadowing experience and specialties represented:** Approximately 30 hours of shadowing experience, split between adult ER, outpatient cardiology, inpatient pediatric hospitalist, and outpatient pediatric psychiatry clinic.  
**8.	Non-clinical volunteering:** Main non-clinical volunteering experience is abroad at a US Embassy where I did a significant amount of youth outreach work.  
**9.	Other extracurricular activities (including athletics, military service, gap year activities, leadership, teaching, etc)**: Plenty of student government experience in undergrad and grad school, with internships in the financial world and with the US Government.  Spent four years in the working world for the Federal Reserve.   
**10.	Anything else not listed you think might be important:** Grades took a bit of a hit during the middle of my postbac year due to a personal illness that is documented by a piece I published online.  Grades went back up now that symptoms are under control  Not sure if I should bring this up in my application or not – open to your thoughts.   Also, in case it helps my grandfather was a pretty prominent neonatologist and was faculty at Case/UBuffalo, was hoping to apply to those two places.

8ixpun,1296,2018-05-12,[MF] The time I was saving up a huge load for my girlfriend...but gave it to an intern instead,DantheFlinFlanMan,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/8ixpun/mf_the_time_i_was_saving_up_a_huge_load_for_my/,"I just discovered this sub, and have thoroughly enjoyed reading though everyone’s naughty tales of deviancy and lust. So I figured I’d share a few stories from my past… back when I was younger and dumber. Ok, that might be putting it lightly… how about, back when I was a piece of shit.

&amp;nbsp;

Throwaway for obvious reasons. And yes certain details have been embellished for the sake of storytelling, but the meat of the story is 100% true. 

&amp;nbsp;

This particular tale happened just a few days before my 27th birthday, which landed on a Saturday that year. Early in the week, I remember my then-girlfriend letting me know her Aunt Flo decided to show up, which was a major bummer. This girl was 100% against period sex, and 1000% against anal, which left only one option. Thankfully, she was a gifted head-giver, and promised me the birthday blowjob of a lifetime to make up for the lack of sex. It was better than nothing, so I hid my disappointment and lied through my teeth saying I couldn’t wait. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, back in those days, my sex drive was still off the charts. We would have sex at least seven times a week, and I’d still have to masturbate daily to focus on anything longer than 15 minutes. So, I decided to spice up the birthday BJ by saving my load and not cumming for the entire week – something I probably hadn’t done since being a pre-teen. But hey, I figured if my girl wanted to make it special, I’d do my best to unleash a Peter North-style cumshot to make it truly memorable.

&amp;nbsp;

I quickly discovered going a full week without whacking off was really, really hard (pun intended). By midweek, I was already irritable and getting turned on by absolutely everything, particularly our department’s summer intern, Staci. I was working at a relatively small insurance brokerage at the time and had my own office, which made me feel like a bigshot. As an intern, Staci couldn’t really do much since she wasn’t licensed to speak with the public, so she mostly stuck to filing and getting coffee, but she was still very popular in the office. Well, among the male staff, at least.

&amp;nbsp;

Staci was your typical sorority girl co-ed. Short and toned with long blonde hair, though always tied up in a bun at work. She was very pretty – borderline gorgeous, though she often wore more makeup than she needed.  And she liked to flaunt the fact she spent more time in the gym than studying by wearing very, very tight clothing. Skirts, blouses, dresses, you name it – they hugged every curve she had and didn’t’ leave much to the imagination when it came to her big perky breasts and round taut ass. Nowadays, I could certainly see her getting called into HR for complaints about her work attire, and for good reason, I’d have to admit. But this was a few years back, and for those that don’t know, insurance even to this day is still a bit of an old boy’s club, so no one ever said anything. And in return for our silence, we got eight hours a day of the girl next door literally bouncing around the office. She’d deliver letters with a smile and an eyeful of cleavage, and always took her time filing documents on the bottom shelf, bent at the hips with her big butt high and proud in the air. It was great.

&amp;nbsp;

Except for that one week, when it was absolute torture. Here I was, horny enough to fuck the watermelon in the lunchroom fridge, and Staci liked to hang around in my office because like I said, all the work we had for her in a day could probably be finished in three hours at most. Plus most of the employees in the office were at least double her age, so I was the most relatable co-worker by far. Most days, she’d make her way into my office sometime after lunch and we’d shoot the shit and flirt while she’d tell me about her personal life. When she wasn’t working, she was either at the gym or partying – I mostly asked about the parties.

&amp;nbsp;

Back to the day in question. It was Friday, it was summer, and it was hot. She was wearing a ridiculous outfit – a tight, short miniskirt and an equally tight white blouse that her ample tits just poured out of. When she came into my office that morning with my cup of coffee in hand, I swear my cock swelled in unison with the rhythmic thumping of my heart, which mirrored the bouncing magnificence that was Staci’s rack in a push-up bra. I was hard as a diamond before she said “Good morning”. But I remained seated, and watched her shapely rear leave my office with a melancholy mixture of horniness and guilt.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to being sexually frustrated, that week had been particularly busy at work with people buying cottages, boats, and other summer toys. After lunch, I figured I’d grab a 30 minute nap before my afternoon meeting to recharge. Mistake number one. I don’t even know if it’s possible to have a sex dream in a thirty minute period, but my penis didn’t care. All I know is I did drift off, and I awoke to an “OH… WOW!”

&amp;nbsp;

Staci, smiling and looking down at me, blinked into my blurry vision. I yawned and stretched, and instantly noticed she wasn’t looking at my face. I followed her vision, down, to my incredibly erect penis threatening to burst through my dress pants at any moment. I looked back up, first at her tits (mistake number two), then her face. Her gaze lingered on my package for another second or two before meeting mine, and I saw the sexy gleam in her eye. That was my downfall.

&amp;nbsp;

“I just came to remind you your meeting with Deb’s in ten minutes,” Staci said, raising her eyebrows. “Though it might be unprofessional bringing that thing in.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Uhhh,” I stammered. My face must have been as red as a chimp’s ass.

&amp;nbsp;

“Don’t think too hard. Might get a sudden rush of blood to the head, big boy.”

&amp;nbsp;

“I haven’t cum in days,” I blurted out – mistake number three. I swear to god, that’s what I said. We’d been flirting much more overtly than usual the entire week, and I just had to let it out – literally. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Jesus!” she laughed. “Well…” She bit her lip in the sexiest way possible – a memory that still gets me hard. “I guess I could help you out.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Close my door,” I said before giving my brain a chance to stop myself.

&amp;nbsp;

She quickly bounced over to my door, shutting it not quite as discreetly as I would have liked. By the time she’d come back, I could feel a wet spot on my boxers from the precum oozing from my cock.

&amp;nbsp;

Staci got down on her knees between my legs and placed her small hand on my hard on. “I wondered when we’d do this,” she said.

&amp;nbsp;

“No time like the present,” I replied, unbuckling my belt and unzipping my fly. Then, with a pop of a button and shimmy of the hips, I pulled my pants down and out flopped my raging erection.

&amp;nbsp;

“Holy shit,” Staci said. “You’re huge!”

&amp;nbsp;

(I’m not. I am lucky in that I’d consider my penis relatively large, but it’s not pornstar huge. C’est la vie.)

&amp;nbsp;

“Think it’ll fit in your mouth?” I asked.

&amp;nbsp;

“Hmmm, let’s see,” she said, lowering herself and placing the head of my dick between her plump lips and giving it a rather sensual kiss. She pulled back slightly, and a string of clear precum stretched from my cock to the bottom of her smile. When she came down again, her mouth opened just enough to fit my head in, and I let out a long groan. I had to throw my head back and close my eyes, as the sight of those wet lips sliding over my purple helmet nearly made me lose it on the very first suck. And even though it was a short blowjob, I’m glad I was able to last longer than that. 

&amp;nbsp;

She firmly grabbed the base of my cock with her right hand and worked herself into a rhythm as she started bobbing up and down. I did briefly think of my girlfriend… until I opened my eyes and looked back down at Staci staring back up at me, smiling about as well as one can with a mouthful of dick. I put my hand on her blonde bun as she sucked and my toes curled in my dress shoes. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

After not even a minute of slurping and gagging noises straight out of a porno, I stood up. I didn’t know exactly how much cum I was about to unleash, but I knew it’d be enough to ruin my suit if I blew in a sitting position. Staci didn’t skip a beat, sucking on my full balls while my wet cock rested on her forehead. As soon as she went back to my dick and got it about halfway in, it was game over. My knees trembled and I’m not even sure what sounds I was making as I released the mega load.

&amp;nbsp;

The first shot or two must’ve hit the back of her throat with the force of a shotgun, because she gagged. Hard. She pulled back off my cock just in time for the third spurt to blast her directly in the face. I tried to grab control, but it was like trying to handle a spraying firehose with a single hand. As cum poured from her mouth from the first couple bursts, shots four and five cleared straight over her head and hit the wall behind her. As her coughs turned to laughter, the remaining spurts landed on her face, glazing her like a donut. Exhausted, I collapsed in my chair.

&amp;nbsp;

“What the hell!” Staci said in mock outrage. “If you warned me I could’ve swallowed.”

&amp;nbsp;

I looked down at the cumpocalypse. She had cum in her hair, on her tits and her blouse. On her thighs and her skirt. Her face was completely covered. And my wall had two healthy splats that Jackson Pollock would be proud of. 

&amp;nbsp;

""I think you might have drowned if you tried swallowing that,” I said in between labored breaths.

&amp;nbsp;

She laughed. “Wow, hung and funny. We’re gonna have to do this again.”

&amp;nbsp;

And we did, throughout the whole summer. After Staci cleaned herself with my gym towel, she mostly hung out in my office the rest of the day while her clothes dried. And I was only five minutes late for my meeting.

&amp;nbsp;

Oh, and my girlfriend-at-the-time did end up giving me a birthday blowjob as promised the next day. It was alright, but even though she did swallow, it still wasn’t as good as Staci’s.

I took a Data Base Systems class this semester and thoroughly enjoyed it (got a 98% on my final!) and my professor suggested that learning more SQL and SQL Server on my own over the summer just to get my bearings and get more comfortable. But I've also been looking into maybe some internships for Data Analysis or even just data entry in my area but nothing seems to come up. And that's my biggest fear since I said I don't have a car at the moment (I take a bus to work or borrow my mom's car). And I just don't want to miss out on an employment opportunity is all.

8ixykw,14,2018-05-12,Just... share.,rosty_slav,Epilepsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/8ixykw/just_share/,"This is going to be long, But I have to share.

It has nothing to do with my epilepsy.
Well, maybe a little.
But I just want to get somethings off my chest.
Don't care that much if anyone reads.

I'm almost 30 years old.
I've lived a comfortable life, for the most part.
Loving parents, home to live in, no financial problems.
Payed myself through law school, got a job as a lawyer which I hold at the same firm for the last 6 years (+1 year internship).
I'm good at what I do. The partners think I'm some kind of genius and every other lawyer seeks my help on (at least) a weekly basis.
I'm always laughing with people. Sarcastic and cynical, but great sense of humor. Make everybody laugh.
I'm rather passive in nature. I rarely volunteer for things, but if someone asks me for help with something, he knows I'll be there and will do my best of the best to help.
Sometimes I think I'm a good person. Sometimes a bad one. But it doesn't really matter.
I have a brother and 2 nieces, who I love very much.

But ever since I remember myself, I've been lonely.
Even when I was surrounded by people.
I can't shake this feeling away.
I've never been intimate with a woman, and the very few relationships I had ended rather quickly without me developing any real feelings.
As time went by, I lost contact with most of my friends. I just grew depressed and tired and didn't want any contact with people who I don't really want to be with.
I have about 2-3 close friends left.
2 of them moved away and recently had a baby, the other one studies for his PhD rather far (and plans to move abroad).
They are all a drive away but since the epilepsy last year, I can't drive.
They all have their lives. They all started to ""be grownups"". Bought a house, had a baby, PhD...
And only I'm stuck in the same place.
At work, at life...

I've stopped looking for dates. It's too hard and I hate the ""games"" that come with them. Despise them. And go explain a 30 year old woman that you're a virgin and you don't plan on marrying in the next 2-3 years. That'll scare'em good.

My body betrays me from around age 13. Bad knees, bad back, bad ankles, hair loss...
And now after my first grand mal, 2 bad shoulders.

I've grown impatient for most people. I go to work with headphones on just to not hear other people talk. I've grown tired of my parent and even moving out of my house didn't help.
There are very few people I have a real desire to talk to.

I have no life basically. Even before the epilepsy. I would stay at home every night, even most weekends, ""glued"" to my computer or television.

I feel that my life is wasting away. I'm 30 years old and I've literally done nothing besides studying and working.

I'm scared of everything. Of being alone, of making mistakes, of talking to pretty girls...
I've had suicidal thoughts years ago. But once again, I was too scared to commit to them.

I've tried therapy. Twice. Been diagnosed with all sorts of personality disorders, somewhere on the spectrum. So what?

I've tried pills.

I can't call ""hotline"" of some kind because I can't really ""talk"" about my problems (part of the trouble I had in therapy).
Nothing works.

Remember when in the movies someone acts like a jerk or something and the other character tells him ""you're gonna end up alone"" or something like that?
Well that's me.

I've said to myself many times in my life, but I'm running out of energy. I can't take it anymore. I just want it to end, one way or another.

I know you can't and not supposed to do anything. Hell, I live in another far away country. 
But since I'm alone, I just needed a place to share.
Just needed to know that someone, somewhere, read it.

Please, no cliches. No sentences like ""look at the bright side, you're smart and funny"" or anything like that. I've heard them all.

Thank you for reading through this.
Hope you have a great week.
Edit: added a sentence."

Still, the way she said 'don't be late' made me resolve *not* to be late.  

The burly guard in the gray slacks and blue blazer standing at the elevator door as it opened is a surprise.  He asks for my pass and takes a good long look at it before he waves me on.  Security is usually very friendly and full of smiles and apologies for the delays and inconveniences.  This guy makes me feel like I'm in his way.  I say thanks, walk down the short corridor and open the door.  No wonder security is tight.  There stands J. Randolph Croder in the flesh, consulting with Marvin, our boss.  But Randy is *his* boss.  Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, he's the founder of *The Firm*.

I glance around the room and see you seated at the table.  Oh shit.  They called you in too?  Do they know?  Did we get sloppy?  Randy had some hard and fast rules that were conditions of employment.  The top directive, the first thing we were taught was 'Do not defecate in your picnic hamper'.  Picnic hamper?  No 'shit' or 'mess kit' for *The Firm*.   Well Randy has a few years under his belt, but he's no prude.  Randy will not tolerate romantic relationships between employees or with customers because it's bad for business.  It's fine to entertain customers but it's to be strictly business.  It's fine to collaborate with coworkers but it's to be strictly business.  

Well with all the travel we did together in cities all over the country, well, how was Randy to find out, as long as we were very discreet.  We took great pains to ensure we weren't caught.  We were careful not to let any of our colleages even *suspect* we were involved.  We often had to sleep single even when we were in the same city.  Even stayed in different hotels.  Yet here we were.  Randy looks at me with an odd smile.  He knows!  He is going to fire us.  Yes I can tell from the way he's looking at me, he knows.  We're toast.

The door opens and Randy turns his gaze toward it.  He smiles and says ""Well, Jen.  You made it just under the wire.""  Oh no, he caught Jen too?  I wait for him to explode.  But instead Randy smiles warmly at each of us and asks Mrs. Collins to distribute our packages.  As she hands us each a leather portfolio with our names embossed in gold leaf in the upper right corner, Randy welcomes us to *The Firm*.  ""Congratulations.  We wish to offer you full time positions.  Effie's giving out your employment packages, but time is short for one of you so you will have to decide quickly.  Jennifer we want you in Boston and Brianna, you in San Diego.  Josh.  It's Kansas City for you.  But you need to decide right now Josh.  There's a key meeting tomorrow and your plane leaves in ...""  Mrs. Collins fills in the blank.  ""One hour.  The car is waiting.  You better just buy what you need when you get out there and expense it.""
 
Mrs. Collins flips my portfolio open and points to a few places.  ""Salary, bonus, housing allowance, expense account, club memberships, time committment.""  She gives me one of her patented 'are you stupid looks' and says ""Only a fool would refuse.""  She hands me a pen and taps the page near the bottom.  She says one word, ""Signature!""

As I stand Randy claps a meaty hand on my shoulder and crushes my hand in a shake I will not soon forget.  Quick goodbyes all around and I'm on my way down to the car waiting at curbside.

It's a short drive, but long enough for me to wonder what life was going to be like with us half a country apart.  Well with all the travel we do I guess it doesn't really matter all that much, does it?  We can meet up for weekends either at one of our places or someplace on the road.  Not much different than we have been doing.  All we need to do is be careful.

***

Six months later and everything is just great!  Lots of money, lots of interesting work and company nearly every weekend.  I'm a *very* lucky man.  My phone beeps.

*  BEEP  *""Hi, wish you were here.""*

*  Yes, being alone is a bummer.  Get in bed and put you hand under the covers.  SEND

*  BEEP  *Yeh, hey that was great.  Thanks.  I hate sleeping single, but that really makes it easier.*

*  Yeah, me too...

""Hey Josh, enough work already.  Quit texting and lets get in bed.  I hate sleeping single and here's a chance to be together so let's make the most of it.""  Jen grins at me and licks her lips in that way that drives me crazy.  ""Josh?  Do you remember Amarillo?""

""Yeah Jen.  Boy do I remember Amarillo.  Be right there.  Just let me send one line.""

*  Yeah, me too.  Sleeping single sucks.  Vegas next weekend.  Nite Bri.  SEND

She made comments about how good I must be at math and do it all day (Asians are good at math stereotype), and kept going on and on about how there are so many fobs applying and how she prefers to work with an ""American guy"" (sinophobia), then saying ""this isn't illegal right?"", and how she's looking into manufacturers in China but they're all written in Chinese so ""I can't read all that stuff"" (othering). It's a moral issue bc I don't want to support this and  work against the interests of people who look like me. BUT. I am also very thirsty for an internship in my field and need to move my career forward.

Funny how race shows up before we even know what each other looks like.

Wat do

Update: ""Thanks for the interview call. I'm pretty direct and outspoken with my comments and questions, so at least you don't have to wonder what I'm really thinking.  😉
I very much look forward to working with you."""
8iy50y,1,2018-05-12,OD/OS Retinoschisis + OD Retinal detachment + OD/OS went through uveitis,PeterZhizhin,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8iy50y/odos_retinoschisis_od_retinal_detachment_odos/,"Age: 21

Approx height: 185 cm

Approx weight: 70 kg

Gender: Male

No drugs, no alcohol in my life, no smoking.

Medications I take right now \(medication will be explained below\): Nevanac, Tobradex, ophthalmoferon \(I will explain what it is below\), corneregel, allokin\-alpha \(I will explain what it is below\), valtrex, levofloxacin, fluconazole. 

Ophthalmoferon \- eye drops based on recombinant alpha\-2b interferon. The drug is designed to treat viral diseases of the eye. Contains human recombinant interferon alpha\-2 \(not less than 10,000 IU / ml\), dimedrol, boric acid, metacel \(""artificial tear""\)

Allokin\-alpha is a Russian drug that contains 1mg of alloferon for subcutaneous injections. This drug is also designed to treat viral diseases caused by different types of herpes or papilloma viruses.

**TL;DR:** OD previous uveitis, developed retinoschisis after dropping while skiing, OD retinoschisis transforms into retinal detachment with two outbreaks \(one in the peripheral, another closer to the macula\), no one knows what to do with me as vitrectomy is dangerous, subretinal fluid drainage and pneumatic retinopexy have been made, outbreaks were separated, big outbreak was laser coagulated, herpes was found in the subretinal fluid, no IgG or IgMs were found for this in the blood, the retina near the center detached again, planned another surgery with adding plomb, possible vitrectomy required.

Actually, this situation freaks me out as the test show contradictory information about herpes found in the subretinal fluid and the fact that retina has been detached again.  

My story: When I was young \(11yo\) I had several exacerbations of uveitis that were caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis.* When the uveitis has been diagnosed for the first time, it has affected both eyes. After is was initially cured, I also had the same disease only on my right eye for couple of times. The root cause was unknown at that time, but after we have found the chlamydia and have finally cured it, the disease never appeared again.  

After the disease: visual acuity with no corrections at 100&amp;#37; OS/60\-80&amp;#37; OD \(it has always been floating since the disease was cured\).

This January I had winter holidays and went skiing once. While I was skiing, I felt down multiple times. The next day flu hit me. Couple of days after I noticed that my night\-vision abilities decreased in the 9\-12 o'clock area of the vision in the right eye. I went to a doctor knowing that this could be signs of retinal detachment. The doctor found nothing after briefly looking at my retina \(without pupil dilatation\) and checking my vision abilities. He said that this could happen because my right eye had couple of infections before and he thinks that astigmatism on the right eye was the cause of these symptoms \(and yeah, I have gained small astigmatism \-0.5 OD\).

In the middle of April, I had a terrible headache at night with one significant difference from other headaches I sometimes have: my right eye hurt while usually it is the front part of the head that hurts. The morning after, I noticed diplopia and straight lines being curved in the right eye. I went to the same doctor and after examining the back part of the right eye, he said that the retina seems fine to him but actually the symptoms are serious, so he sent me to a more appropriate clinic.  

In the clinic, they diagnosed retinoschisis OD\+OS. While the OS retinoschisis was small, the OD retinoschisis caused two retinal detachment outbreaks: first one was big at the very bottom of the eye and the second one closer to the macula was smaller. These two detachments had a thin connection between them. The macula was not detached.

However, as the vision was 50&amp;#37; OD, the macula was not detached, I had uveitis on the right eye that caused a lot of floaters in the eye connected to the retina, they told me that vitrectomy is dangerous for the eye and could cause the vision loss. Moreover, I had no loss of visual field. They advised me to just wait and live a normal life as they basically can't do a lot. And I actually went nuts after this, because I knew that these things should be treated as fast as possible.  

I went to a private clinic where a surgeon told me that my situation is basically very unique as they don't see any tears on the retina \+ OCT doesn't show them and there are two outbreaks there that are connected. They don't believe that this is the X\-linked retinoschisis as the retinoschisis have never been diagnosed before and I was carefully checked when I had uveitis when I was young. Moreover, they don't see typical signs of X\-linked retinoschisis on the exams and no male relatives have any eye problems. They also don't think that this is degenerative retinoschisis as I am very young.  

They actually came up with a surgery strategy: drain the fluid from the big detachment and hope that the fluid in the second detachment will be drained as well, then apply pneumatic retinopexy with C2F6 gas combined with sterile air. They have explained that vitrectomy is dangerous for me as I am very young and had infections in the eye. But vitrectomy could be the only option if nothing helps.  

I have also visited the third clinic \(one of the best government hospitals that treat eye diseases\). They have advised scleral buckling and told that subretinal fluid drainage is not actually possible. They then just kicked me out of the clinic and didn’t answer any questions for me.  

I have read some scientific articles and web pages that describe possible solutions for handling retina detachments. They explained that draining the fluid is definitely possible and pneumatic retinopexy had the lowest complications rate and have that option. The surgery was successful, they have drained the fluid and two detachments have been separated. After the detachments were separated, they have done a laser coagulation in order to prevent the big detachment from spreading. However, the detachment that is closer to the macula was still there but was significantly smaller in size.  

They have examined the subretinal fluid drained during that operation and found herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus there using polymerase chain reaction. I have never had any signs of herpes before: no rash on the lips, no genital herpes, just nothing. They also got my blood for immunoglobulin diagnosis. No IgM or IgG were found for herpes of I, II, V. They actually found IgG for herpes type VI and started anti\-viral treatment with Valtrex, ophthalmoferon, and allokin\-alpha. Also, staphylococcus was found with no signs of infections \(C\-reactive protein and ECP levels were fine\), so they have added antibiotics just in case this happened because of the bacteria. Immunotherapy as anti\-viral treatment is being discussed now as well.  

I spent a week in a face down position and even though the reattachment did not happen, they have told me to start living again. I spent some time taking walks and trying to return back to normal life. But actually, it turned out that the retina detached again. They decided to add a plomb to the back of the eye in the detachment region. The surgeon explained that they could not place the plomb during the first operation as they didn’t find any tears there. She told that as they didn’t see any tears and holes, so they were going to close the whole sector with the plomb. If this doesn’t help, vitrectomy is the only available option. And they are not sure whether even vitrectomy will do the job as the eye had several infections there and it can actually do worse and even worsen the detachment as the gel that they are planning to inject could also get under the retina. They say that scleral buckling would not do the job as the detachment area is very close to the macula and if we place the buckle, we will get an eye with vascular problems and this is not better than doing vitrectomy.

FYI, the timeline:

1. Beginning of January – first symptoms \(problems with night vision\)

2. 7th of April 2018 – found out that I have double vision and straight lines being curved. Consulting with the doctor at the same day. Sent into another clinic

3. 8th of April 2018 – got into the clinic. Retinoschisis and retinal detachment diagnosed

4. 12th of April 2018 – the first surgeon consultation

5. 14th of April 2018 – the second surgeon consultation, the third surgeon consultation

6. 16th of April 2018 – found out that peripheral vision started disappearing

7. 23rd of April 2018 – first surgery: pneumatic retinopexy, subretinal fluid drainage

8. 26th of April 2018 – laser coagulation in order to prevent big peripheral detachment from spreading

9. 7th of May 2018 – the situation got worse, detachment diagnosed again

10. 10th of May 2018 – the surgeon consultation, plomb placement decision

11. 14th of May 2018 – planned surgery

Having that said, your guesses on the prognosis? Will I have some vision this eye? Does anybody have anything close to that? Could retinoschisis be caused by herpes that is hidden somewhere inside my body right now? And if so, why I don’t have any IgG immunoglobulin in my blood? What would you recommend me to ask doctors about? What should I do in order to prevent this situation with the left eye?

I was also planning an internship this summer in the US. What do you think, is it a good idea to go there at all?

I hope that this was an interesting story. I am just freaking out how bad it is, so I have even written this post here. It is terrible to see how I am basically losing the sight in the right eye and nothing helps and the cause for this is unknown and the surgery options are all bad and usually cause serious problems such as cataract and retinal hemorrhage.

8iy9ni,110,2018-05-12,The Saga of AnimeAssassin: In which I run out of MotherDearest's rich ass house wearing nothing but a bathrobe at midnight,CastielGalafran,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/8iy9ni/the_saga_of_animeassassin_in_which_i_run_out_of/,"TW: Domestic violence, child abuse, rape

I haven't posted this doozy yet because I was never sure if it was more r/JustNoSO, r/JustNoFamily, or r/JustNoMIL. There's just a lot of JustNo in this. It was...insane...

Really, really, insane. 

This is probably the most insane experience of my life. 

In April 2016 I was living in a loft. My cousin, a 24 year old woman, was supposed to be living with me but was always at her fiance's house. Just for a bit of reference, she had met this man in December 2016 and gotten engaged in March 2016. But, you know, I hadn't made all the greatest decisions at that point in my life either so I didn't have the energy to judge. She was happy. 

The deal my cousin and I had was that we would split rent 50/50, paying $200 each to our landlord on the first of each month. I was able to handle this setup with my two jobs. I actually loved that loft. Since I was pretty much the only person living there, I really felt like it was my space. I hung out with a stray cat I had named Bernie who came around when I cooked dinner every night. We would sit together on the balcony and I'd split my meal with her. AnimeAssassin lived a five minute walk away and hated his roommates, so he would spend every night at my place. But in that glorious chunk of time between coming home from school and AnimeAssassin showing up, I owned this little space.

But like all good things in my life during that time, it was short lived. The first day of finals week, which was the first week of May, I came up to my landlady before school and handed her my $200 portion of the rent. She took it from me, then just stood there in silence. I laughed nervously and asked her what was up.

""Where's the other $200?"" she demanded.

""Oh, Cousin will bring that by. I'll text her to remind her.""

The landlady got this annoyed expression on her face, ""Cousin moved out two weeks ago and signed over her half of the lease to you. You need to give me the full rent.""

I stood there dumfounded. I was completely unaware that my cousin had moved out. Her clothes were still in the loft. I had seen her a couple of times in the last two weeks. We'd texted. My landlady lived downstairs and I saw her every day. Neither had thought to mention to me this new development in my living situation. I told the landlady that much, and also told her that I didn't have another $200 to give her.

""Then you need to be out by the end of this week."" she stated, ""The $200 you gave me will pay for your last week here.""

I went to school and descended into full blown panic. I was going to be homeless again. She took my last $200. I had nowhere to go, no money to put down as a deposit, and absolutely no idea what to do. I told AnimeAssassin what had happened and he swooped in with a fan-fucking-tastic solution.

We could move in with his parents. 

Let it be known that this is an option that I never, ever would have taken if I weren't out of options. These people, this entire family, were just absolutely batshit. I was terrified of them and I didn't hold an ounce of respect for any of them. Allow me to list some of their shenanigans so I can set the scene for the shitstorm that resulted from this decision:

-They came from a wealthy American family from Pennsylvania. The family was long established here since the revolutionary war. MotherDearest got a big inheritance from the family that allowed them to move into the ultra-wealthy part of town. We're talking mansions and Lamborghinis driven by obnoxious trust fund babies. MotherDearest and the father built a ridiculous house out there and filled it with a bunch of mall ninja Asian relics despite being white as fuck. The most ethnicity they could possibly claim was Italian and Scottish from long, long ago. 

-Despite the large inheritance and the substantial income earned by the father being some sort of engineering contractor and MotherDearest being an adoption counselor, this family was flat broke. They had drained the youngest two children's college funds, and when those had been sucked dry, AnimeAssassin and his younger sister had to go work at grocery stores in high school in order to bring home food. 

-Why was the family flat broke? Because Father was a violent drunk and gambling addict who blow half the fortune on booze and slot machines. MotherDearest was a narcissist who just had to keep up with the Jones'. She blew the other half of the fortune on multiple extravagant vacations a year. Draining the college funds? Oh, that wasn't to pay the bills. That would be absolutely ridiculous! The children's college money was spent on a couple trips to Hawaii, of course.

-This family somehow managed to keep getting their claws on Korean children, bringing them into the country and ""adopting"" them. I still question the legitimacy of this. I know CPS isn't perfect, but they were being called on this family frequently. I'm not sure how, after so many reports had been filed, after all the abuse had been documented, and with the family having no money, that they were able to keep adopting babies from Korea. 

-The father was also wildly racist and creepily sexist. He constantly used racist slurs directed towards Asians around the adopted children. AnimeAssassin's younger sister was also molested frequently by other men as a child, and the father always said shit like, ""Well, you know, she just has that look. Of course they couldn't resist. She shouldn't have traipsed around in that little outfit"". He said this about a child. An actual child. Being molested by grown men.

-MotherDearest was an absolute hurricane of a woman. Apparently she had been quite physically abusive to the children when they were younger. But physical abuse wasn't her forte. AnimeAssassin didn't just become a master manipulator on his own. No. He was taught by the master. 

-But MotherDearest couldn't let the rich neighbors in on the family drama. She had appearances to maintain! This lady fed her massive ego by getting her claws into whatever minority community she could and then setting herself up as some sort of hero in the community. Her latest craze was Muslims. This old WASP-y white lady weaseled her way into the local Muslim community and somehow got into a position of authority. She made damn sure that it was *her* picture in the newspapers, that is was *her* getting interviewed by the local news stations, and it was *her* giving the speeches whenever the media would come to their events. I think at some point she had a craze for the Mexican immigrants in our community, and at some other point she was all about the Asian immigrants. Whatever minority group she targeted, her M.O. was the same. Manipulate a vulnerable people group, use their struggle for publicity, and when the publicity runs dry abandon the vulnerable group and move onto the next. 

-All the children but three had gone NC or VLC with the parents. The three who were still in their lives were AnimeAssassin, his biological brother, and one of his adopted brothers. The biological brother was some sort of addict who wanted to be an artist. He was the black sheep of the family and I honestly felt bad for him. He just seemed so beaten down. The father didn't hold back in expressing disappointment in him. He was blamed for everything that went wrong, even things he had no power over. Once, the parents insisted on buying him a car, whatever car he wanted. He picked out a truck that could be used to haul around his art stuff. He found a cheap, used truck and they all agreed to get the truck. Instead, the parents buy him a brand new mini car, something like a Volkswagen beetle or Mini Cooper. When he expressed confusion and disappointment over this, the entire family chewed him out for being ungrateful and lazy. I really wanted to get to know this brother, but whenever I was around him the family was around too. And if the family was around, this poor guy was just shrunk into a corner, all but refusing to speak or make eye contact with anyone.  

-The adopted brother is someone who I will fight if I ever get the chance. This fuck was, and still is, a violently abusive gambling addict. He beat on his wife and frequently pulled a gun on his own children, threatening to kill them if the wife left. I loved those kids. One was a little 6 year old girl and the other was a quiet, scared 9 year old boy. The boy had such dead eyes, like all hope had been sucked out of him. Once, before this story took place, AnimeAssassin got a call from his mom late at night. The brother had been arrested. He had beat the wife when she tried to escape. With her bloodied up in the house, he declared he was going to go kill the children. He was caught outside the children's school with a gun in the car. Somehow, and I have no idea how, he got out with no charges and no consequences. The parents embraced him with open arms, saying that he was their son and he'd *never* do anything like that. It must have been a misunderstanding! Whenever I had to sit next to that fuck at the dinner table I glared at him, trying to send a mental message that he could fucking fight me. That's why I embraced the role of nanny the family forced on me. At least if I was around the children their father couldn't hurt them. 

So, with the scene set, onto the story you all came for.

With no other place to go, I moved into this perfectly functional, healthy household after finals week. AnimeAssassin and I found ourselves living in his childhood bedroom, sleeping together on a twin sized bed, in an oversized and creepy house 45 minutes away from where I'd been living previously. I was an hour away from family and friends. I also didn't have a car. If I wanted to get out of that house, I had to ask either AnimeAssassin or MotherDearest for a ride. The father wasn't a ride option because that winner had permanently lost his license after one too many DUI's. 

I told myself I just had to stick it out for three weeks until I flew across the country for a ten week long internship. I could survive three weeks. It wouldn't be so bad. 

Of course, it was so bad. 

Every morning and night I lay like a corpse on the bed as AnimeAssassin jammed his fingers inside of me. I said ""no"" most of the time, or I was sleeping. But I guess he needed to feel loved and jamming his gnarly fingers into my dry vagina while his parents were in the adjacent room was his way of feeling loved.

I couldn't escape the father's leering stares. Once I went swimming in a bathing suit. Emphasis on *once*. 

MotherDearest was the worst though. She wanted to be my new mom. I mean that quite literally. I was to call her ""mom"" and if I didn't she'd pout then tell AnimeAssassin that I was being frigid. She probed me for all the juicy details on the shit my family was going through, getting especially excited if I mentioned anything negative about my own mom. If I said anything positive about my family she'd get a face like she'd just smelled a fart and go, ""Mmmmmm....that's *interesting*, hooonnnneeeeyyyyyyyyyy."" 

Additionally, she spent many of our conversations convincing me that going to graduate school after graduation was an absolutely terrible idea. After all, it was selfish to make her son move away from her. Why couldn't I get a nice teaching job? I'd never get a good job with a physics PhD anyway. I should just be a teacher so that AnimeAssassin could live out his engineering dreams. I wish I could say that I blocked myself off to all that manipulation, but you wanna know why yah gurl is on a gap year right now?

Yeah. I listened to her. I got a teaching job right after college. Then when I left AnimeAssassin, I lasted a quarter at that job until I finally said ""fuck it"" and quit. I applied to grad school last minute, got accepted into nine schools, and am starting at the #1 nuclear physics school this August. Guys, I love kids but I'm no teacher. I fucking hate teaching. I have mad respect for people who dedicate their lives to that job, because that is some hard shit. 

Anyway, with all this, I ended up spending all my days alone in that big house, locked in the bedroom. I quickly came to know what noises meant what. His parents were not stealthy people and it was easy to know where in the house they were. The moment the noises indicated that the kitchen was clear, I'd sneak downstairs, grab whatever food I could lay my hands on, and retreat to the relative safety of the bedroom.

As the days passed, I saw a darker side of AnimeAssassin. Now that he was among his own kind, he didn't need to hide his real nature anymore. He became harsher, more critical, more controlling. One mistake, even if it wasn't actually a mistake, would set him off. He yelled at me in the car once for being just a little slow in telling him directions. We didn't miss a turn or anything. He just didn't like the pause I took. He hated the clothes I wore, he hated my voice, he hated the stories I wrote, the shows I watched. I was too loud, too quiet. Too skinny, too big. Slept too much, slept too little. Talked too slow, talked too fast. I had to check in with him constantly so he knew exactly what I was doing during the day, but god forbid I send one text too many or else his fucking useless girlfriend is distracting him from his real adult job. 

The tensions rose. 

That house had the same feel of some demon infested home from *Paranormal Activity*. There was a darkness lurking there.

Finally, it all reached a breaking point. 

Two weeks in, on a Sunday, AnimeAssassin suddenly wanted to go to church. He hated church. He hated religion. But on this day he was a handwaving, Jesus loving church boy, so in the afternoon we packed up and went to what he said was his childhood church. He claimed that everyone there knew and loved him. No one there knew him. They certainly didn't love him. We just sat alone, sang some Jesus songs, and left. 

When we got in the car, we discovered that MotherDearest had left a ton of voicemails on his phone. Odd. I asked him if he should call her back and he said ""fuck no"". I shrugged it off and reasoned that we'd be home soon enough. They could talk then if he didn't want to talk now. But she kept calling. And calling. And calling. Finally, AnimeAssassin ordered me to answer the phone so I did. 

MotherDearest was in absolute hysterics.

We had ruined the day! The whole family was torn apart now and they were going to die on their vacation and never say I love you again (the parents and adopted brother's family were leaving for yet another Hawaii vacation the coming morning)! Everything was ruined forever! She has lost her beloved son!

I got the lady to calm down enough to ask if she wanted to talk to AnimeAssassin, then handed the phone over to him. He started shouting at her. She started shouting at him. Through all the hysterics I managed to piece together that during the exact time we were at church, the entire family had been supposed to meet up for an early dinner. I knew nothing about this, but apparently AnimeAssassin did. 

He hung up the phone and drove him erratically. When we pulled into the driveway, I talked him down. I told him that we could just go right up to the bedroom and he didn't need to talk to his mom. He promised me that he was calm and that there would be no confrontation. 

The moment we walk into the house, he marches up to MotherDearest and screams, ""Do you have a fucking explanation, you stupid cunt?!"" 

I ran up to the bedroom and locked the door. I sat there on my computer and tried to block out the screaming match taking place downstairs. After maybe ten minutes, AnimeAssassin pounded on the door and declared we were leaving the house. We got into the car as MotherDearest toddled behind us, sobbing and shouting incoherently. Fortunately, the timing of this little blow up worked out decently and we left the house just in time to arrive at Doge's place for dinner. We spent a few hours with Doge, watching *South Park*, eating pasta, and drinking wine. Things were happy. You'd never guess the blow up that had just occurred.

Around 11 at night we returned to the house. All the lights were off, to my relief. That meant the parents were asleep. We snuck in, got ready for bed, and laid down. AnimeAssassin jammed his fingers into my vagina. And, in that perfectly dignified moment as he jackhammered his hand into me as I lay there like a corpse, waiting for it to be over, a hear a knock at the bedroom door. 

""AnimeAssassin?"" came MotherDearest's nasally voice.

We froze. Perhaps if we said nothing she'd go away.

She didn't. The knock continued. She kept saying his name. Finally, AnimeAssassin throws on his bathrobe and I pull the sheets up over myself, pretending to be asleep.

He flung open the door and Screaming Match Smackdown Round 2 was on. 

I usually have an almost photographic memory and can run a play by play of most conversations. But I must have blocked the majority of this out. I remember MotherDearest had jammed her tubby little body into the door, trying to force her way into the bedroom. AnimeAssassin was slamming the door on her, hard, over and over, screaming at her to get out. She was crying and saying something about how much she loves him and that he's never acted like this before. He responded by declaring that she would never see her grandchildren and that she'd die alone. Then, with a shove, he booted MotherDearest out of the bedroom and onto her ass. He turned to me and stated, ""Get your shit. We're going.""

I get my short, skimpy little bathrobe on and rush to the bathroom to put in my contacts so I'm not fucking blind. MotherDearest then set her sights on me. She toddled after me, grabbing at my arm, begging me to speak to AnimeAssassin.

""You're the only one he'll listen to! You have a gift! He has anger issues, Castiel. Only you know how to calm him!"" she wailed, ""Bring me back my son!"" 

She cornered me in the bathroom and kept repeating this. AnimeAssassin walked by and muttered, ""Fuck you, mom"". I apologized and slipped by her. She followed me. AnimeAssassin got in her face. More screaming.

Finally, the father came out of the bedroom. He took one look at AnimeAssassin and MotherDearest and said, ""MotherDearest, if he smacks you again it'll be your own fucking fault."" 

I paused for a moment as my brain registered that AnimeAssassin had hit his mother before, and that the father was the sort of person to blame the victim of violence rather than the doer of violence. But I didn't have much time to fully appreciate that fact, because AnimeAssassin grabbed my arm, marched me down the stairs, and out the door. MotherDearest followed behind, wailing as if she were a professional mourner at some ancient funeral. We got in the car as she clawed at the door, begging us not to leave. AnimeAssassin slammed the door on her hand, then slammed it again and drove off. 

We made it maybe a quarter mile until he slammed on the brakes, put the car in park, and started sobbing.

""You think I'm a monster now. I'm a monster."" he repeated, over and over.

I held him as he cried, assuring him that he was not a monster, and trying to get him calm enough to help me think of a plan. We were now homeless again. We couldn't just spend the rest of the summer in the car. We had to do something. As he sobbed, I called up my friends who are a married couple with their own house. By some miracle, they were awake. I explained the situation and they had us come over. They told us we were welcome to stay with them for as long as we needed. 

To be honest, I was relieved that we no longer had to step foot in that house. But, as with all things, my joy, relief, and sense of security was shortlived. The next morning AnimeAssassin woke up as if nothing had happened. He declared that we were to return to the house and continue living there. I begged him not to do it. I knew the parents had left for their trip right now, but I was scared of that house. I hated it there and I didn't want to be so far away from everyone I knew. But there was no telling him no. We returned to the house and I spent my last week before my internship there alone, the argument echoing through the halls like angry ghosts. 

When the parents returned from Hawaii it was like nothing had happened. In fact, AnimeAssassin and MotherDearest denied that anything had happened. When I tried to bring it up to him, he told me that I was making it all up because I hated his family.

But I remember.

It's pretty fucking hard to forget running out of a wealthy, crazy ladies house at midnight naked except for your bathrobe. 

I've told a few people this story and they look at me in utter shock. I guess this sort of family dynamic isn't normal. I don't know if W, my new guy, will ever know exactly why I like his mom so much. She's a sassy, witty Mexican lady who loves *Game of Thrones* and will talk to me for hours on all manner of subjects. She lovingly calls her son *mijo*. They hug each other and he kisses her on the cheek when they say goodbye. She had the strength to keep his heroin addict father out of his life, even if it meant that she worked three jobs so that her son could have food and shelter. I don't know her very well, but she's a good woman. 

I've been alone in a room with her and haven't felt fear. 

Perhaps W will never know that not only is he a rare find among men, his mom is a rare find among mothers, but I will never again take people like that for granted. For as long as I can I will value every moment I get to spend with him and his mom. They may not live in the wealthy part of town in a big house, they may not impress their neighbors with extravagant vacations and nice new cars, they may not get their pictures in the paper for being a ""saviour"" to some poor minority community. You'll probably never hear about them like you'd hear about AnimeAssassin and MotherDearest. They don't have the *reputation* of these rich folk. 

But in the poor part of town, in a neighborhood where gangs run the streets at night and bodies turn up in the alley, in the part of the city rich folk like to pretend doesn't exist, is a *Game of Thrones* loving mother who sacrificed everything for her son, and a son who kisses his mother goodbye, says ""I love you"" and fucking means it.

This is my fifth year being vegetarian. I’ve been thinking about going vegan for a while and really anything I would say about why I haven’t yet just sounds like a weak excuse to me now. I suppose I will try to transition into it slowly eventually.

Also, I’m struggling a lot with my thoughts about going to uni this fall. I have been set on medical research for a long while but these days worries about animal testing and having animals die so I can study their dead bodies have been plaguing me. I read on the FAQ page on one of the unis that it is possible to avoid animal testing during studies (even if that means I’ll have less internship offers or I’ll have to skip courses, the fact that it’s possible makes me really happy). I don’t know about the other unis though. Let alone the future after studying. Right now I just dream of being able to pursue my career wishes in an animal cruelty free way. Maybe I should go into computer science instead and work on developing simulation programmes. Ah, I’m sorry that this turned into a ramble.

I love animals and hope you guys are having a nice day. I’ll be over here giving out hugs to anyone who needs them."

I interviewed for Boeing and got an offer for a software engineer 1 position yesterday. In your experience, how long did it take to clear your contingencies, do the background check, and start your first day?

I am asking because I am starting an full time 3 month long internship this coming week and would probably resign early."

The McCain Institute for International Leadership is a think tank established in cooperation with Arizona State University. The primary focus of the foundation is combatting human trafficking and promoting a new generation of ""national security leaders."" The McCain Institute has hosted a number of speaking events over the years, with speakers such as Joe Biden, Ben Affleck, Hillary and Bill Clinton, Governor Chris Christie, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe. Board members of the McCain Institute's Human Trafficking Advisory Council include Ashton Kutcher, co-founder of anti-human trafficking group, Thorn. The Institute's Board of Trustees includes Lynn Forester de Rothschild, former general David Petraeus and Joseph Lieberman. Factoring in board members, employees and interns, the McCain Institute has 80 employees assisting their operations in various capacities.
 With the above list of characters as trustees, and McCain's long list of corruption allegations, no surprise here. It seems he has not been using any of his donations to his foundation for any human trafficking relief, so where is the money going?"

So I'll cut to the chase, I'm a 21 year old college student living near downtown Chicago for 3 months for a summer internship. I'm looking for someone who can show me around Chicago and a friend/FWB type of relationship while I'm here. 

Some things about me:
- I love food and trying new places and meeting new people. I might be a bit shy at first but I open up once we get to know each other more. 

- I have almost zero sexual experience. I've received a blowjob once, but it didn't feel that great. So being with someone patient and understanding would make the experience better for of us.

- Along with the internship, I'm also taking 3 summer classes so I might be busy some days more than others.

If you're interested, send me a PM. If you're on the fence, I'm open to chatting for a bit and/or sending a picture of myself so you have a better idea of who I am.

Thank you for reading and hope you have a nice day!"

8j1ip2,3,2018-05-13,Girlfriend doesn't know what to do with ex,unglamorous_guy,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8j1ip2/girlfriend_doesnt_know_what_to_do_with_ex/,"My girlfriend of about 6 months now still talks to her ex via texting, and I think a bit of calling and Skyping. We are both 2nd years at UCLA. Her ex currently is in Australia doing some internship or something. Anyways, he might or might not be coming back to UCLA the next school year. He's biz-econ :P

Reasons she broke with him: he's an asshole, he did stuff (though she says she thinks it wasn't full on intercourse) with other girls, he kept telling her to workout, wear makeup, wear more prettier/promiscuous outfits, and probably most importantly, he kept asking her if she wanted to have an open relationship (so he can do stuff with other girls) until she couldn't take it anymore and decided to break it off.

Reasons of why she says she still keeps in contact with him: She said he still gets her and all of her idiosyncrasies, she still finds him interesting. She says she still loves him. 

In the end, she thinks he's an asshole and a fuckboy (which he is I think) but she says to me that she doesn't know what to do. I told her I did not like this at all since their relationship ended on such heart breaking terms. I told her I was uncomfortable that she still texts him regularly and keeps in contact. I told her all of this and kindly asked her not to speak to him anymore at all, but she has no answer for me. I hinted at a break and she cried and felt sad. I don't know what to do. I just know I don't want her to keep in contact with her ex at all. 

Thoughts on what I should do? 

I love you Isabelle :'^)"
8j1rf3,12,2018-05-13,[S14E23 Spoilers] My thoughts on 14x23,Sgt_Pepper_LH,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/8j1rf3/s14e23_spoilers_my_thoughts_on_14x23/,"I liked the episode a lot! But not all of it. Here are my thoughts:

The Good: Overall it was very heartfelt and touching. I loved Nicole Herman and Arizona's reunion. I love everything related to Amelia and Owen and their foster family (I also loved the glance that they gave each other when Arizona explained that April and Matthew had reunited because they ""understood each other's pain""). April and Jackson stole the show - it was awesome to watch Jesse Williams in the scene where he prayed. He did some incredible acting! I also liked when April and Maggie interacted after April woke up. It was very sweet how April wanted to keep holding Maggie's hand because it was warm :) I also liked Bailey's advice about focusing on facts in times of distress - that is practical, good advice.

The OK: Roy seems to be taking his internship seriously now, so I could myself liking him as a character if he sticks around for Season 15.

The Bad: April and Matthew being back together irks me. She left him at the altar, was indirectly involved with the death of his wife, the timeline does not make sense - I could probably come up with other complaints, but there are already a bunch of threads on the subject. While I loved their implied reconciliation in the chapel after April helped to save Ruby's life a few episodes ago, jumping from that to them ""being in love"" seems awfully contrived. If April was sticking around for Season 15, I would be rooting for them to break up.

I also did not like Grey crying. She is usually incredibly collected and stoic in the face of tragedy, so for her to cry (and over Kepner of all people - I mean, yes they are friends, but they have never been particularly close) seemed very out of character.

I am not crazy excited about the season finale, but it will be nice if Alex and Jo finally get married. I am curious to see how exactly April leaves, and whether or not Carina will go with Arizona to New York. Beyond that, I wonder if any of the Interns will get promoted to Regular status in Season 15. Then I can stop thinking about the show for a few months! Phew :) LOL"
8j1uqr,1,2018-05-13,While in Fishlake Forest,Kiki01234,clancypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/clancypasta/comments/8j1uqr/while_in_fishlake_forest/,"Fear. That emotion that will kick in before any other when you know you are lost or in trouble or to put it simply, something is just not right. Growing up, ever since I could remember, it played a huge role in my life. It was the deciding point for a lot of things. Let us begin by introducing myself, I will introduce myself as Joe, not my real name for obvious reasons and neither will any other names you see here. I was as most would call, “gifted.” But let me tell you, this so called gift is as much a curse as it is anything else, because of it I have many stories of things I have heard, or things i have seen and sometimes they just unbelievable. Heck I might not even believe some of them had they not happened to me. But now i will now tell you about a time a certain time in my life in which fear got the best of me and the notion of survival was forcibly put into gear. This is a true story.

                I was around 12 at the time, a small little kid if you ever saw one weighing in at a lanky 80 pounds. I was a sevy to be. It was summer, and work was very busy at the time. And yes I mean work, I did an unpaid internship in an auto shop starting at a much younger age and by now i knew my way around. Many cars were breaking down that summer and I knew I would go crazy if I did not give my mind a break, it was as if my friends read my mind. They could not have called me at a better time. My buddies Brian and Michael called me and said they were planning a trip to Josh’s parents cabin, I won’t specify what city it was in but I will say it was in Fishlake National Forest, Utah. His parents had a very nice mansion style home away from the city and cabin about 15 min. walk away from their home. They said we could come down and we were all exited. We would leave for the cabin in 2 days and the trip would last for 3 days and quite frankly, I could not wait.

                Well the 2 days passed by, and I had a bad feeling that day. You know. The feeling you get when the universe is trying to convey a message of dread or despair. But of course being a few exited teens, we soon forgot about that awful feeling. Well anyway the time comes. And Brian's older brother, Brandon, picks me up along with michael in his what he liked to call old but reliable minivan. We didn’t even make it 30 min. and the van started sputtering and shut off, we would later found out brians brother, the idiot. forgot to gas her up, i guess his gas gauge was broken but he was just pretty good about keeping gas in there but this time it slipped his mind. Anyways, I should have taken and just given up on the trip completely I should have read the signs that god set there for me. Because, well, everything happens for a reason, Right? I would say so, but 12 yr old me wasn’t having it. I asked my father to pick us up and to borrow his SUV And again, off we went all of us 12 year old kids and 19 year old Brandon, he was the reason our parents agreed to this trip in the first place, because Brandon would be our guardian while Josh’s parents were away for the weekend. We would have his house and his cabin all to ourselves. So we went on our way to the woods.

                It was a long 2 or maybe closer to 3 hours after leaving my home if i recollect correctly, when we finally arrived. We passed Salina and a bunch of small towns that you could miss if you blinked. Josh lived in one of these blink and you will miss it town, and his backyard was forests composed of pines and aspens. The air was cleaner here ways from the big city and near the woods, I could breathe easily and peacefully. We spent the day looking through Josh’s house and if you haven’t already guessed, yes he was rich. Or rather his parents were. This home was huge and fancy as heck especially considering location, well The day rolled on fast and It was now sunset and we decided it would be a good idea to play hide and seek. It most certainly was, the sunset was beautiful and finding a hiding spot was very easy amongst all the undergrowth, shrubs, and of course, the trees. I forgot to mention there was not much civilization around during this time, maybe a half a mile away was a house that shared a huge fire pit right on the property line. Anyone was welcome to it. Other than that it was just a few houses on tons of acreage of land. And the woods as their very own playground. Just a few hundred meters into their backyard. We played for around an hour or so and got tired so we went inside for snacks and to play video games. Complete dark hit, what seems minutes after we went inside. This was no average darkness either, nothing like the cities which always seemed to be lit up no matter what time of day it was, this was…   ADVANCED DARKNESS.

                The first night was awesome, playing war games on a huge TV and foosball in the next room over. Josh had snacks for all of us and was really glad he had friends over. You see, with him living in such a rural area he hardly had any visitors. We paid no attention to time and hours passed and it went from video games, to board games, to soda drinking contests and back to video games and hours of fun just passed til’ eventually, one by one we passed out into slumber.

                The second day, I was the first to awake the next morning at around 11 a.m., followed by Michael. We talked and laughed about the stuff we did all last night. Man, my stomach was turning from all the soda we had. We were glad we were all guys and there were no party poopers. We were brainstorming ideas of what would await us today. That’s when Brian awoke followed by the Josh and lastly Brandon, and they decided we would play soccer until we could think of plans for the rest of the afternoon and then night. And out we went to play soccer, one by one the group trudged sleepily out. I was goalie, naturally since it was very hard to score on me. While playing I noticed the fire pit in all its magnificent glory, this was a very very nice fire pit there was a concrete pour with pillars to hold the roof overhead. And it also had its definite diy benches made out of bricks it was awesome.

                Nightfall began that second night it was close to sunset, we hadn’t really done much all day just the usual wondering what to do so long that the day eluded us, I asked Josh about that fire pit, I wanted so bad to go warm up next to a cozy fire more than anything, he told me it was his, and we were more than welcome to use it. Looking back now i wish he had just said no. But again everything happens for a reason. Then sunset hit once again, we lit the fire, brought out the s’mores and set the mood for scary stories. One by one we all began, I started, “Once upon a time…” and we all continued stories. When it was my turn again I decided to step it up a bit, my grandparents were strongly spiritual and often times had times where they dealt with the devil, and so started to tell one of their stories, beginning with, “This is a true story…” just then we noticed the wind started blowing. The air began to have a musty and humid, smell to it. The sweet smelling fresh air was no more. Josh told us it was most likely going to rain so we all looked up, the night sky was completely clear of clouds. I had not noticed before but the stars and the moon glowed as bright as the sun. It was beautiful out, it was dark but I had never actually seen the stars like this before and it took my breath away. What came next I would have never done if I would’ve known what was about to happen to me, we decided to play a game of hide and seek under the stars and stop the scary stories, because, well it looked like it might’ve gotten out of hand if we would have continued. We ran inside, got some flashlights, put in new batteries for safety and ran back out to begin.

                I drew the short straw and it was my turn to count first. I was calling out the numbers as loud as I could, as I did not want be called a cheater for miscounting, “one, two, three… twenty. Here I come ready or not!” When I turned around I realized this was not like the last games we played, the sun was no longer out and the woods were not off limit, and although the bright full moon was out, the woods beneath the trees were completely dark, and the still burning fire a few feet away from me was of no aid. We had said every 15 minutes the game would restart at the safe spot. I decided I would search without the flashlight first to not alert them of my presence. That turned out to be a huge mistake, in fact it could have almost been fatal. It was like one of those stupid stunts someone does in a horror movie where you just want to scream at them to not do it, but Off I went running this way and that for what seemed an eternity, with no hopes of finding anyone, the few times i did follow rustling it was a dead end. Soon I decided I was taking too long and I checked the time, 15 minutes had passed according to my phone, and I did not hear or see anyone. That meant time was up, at 15 minutes I was obligated to yell to everyone to huddle up and I was it again. And if someone didn’t come back immediately we had to search for them. But, there was one problem...

                I realized after all that walking, running, and turning that I did not know where I was so I decided, to turn on my flashlight and walk back while yelling hoping I was in sound reach. Just then I realized a sudden change in wind direction and the smell of the greenery in the forest got significantly stronger. The flashlight started flickering, i shook it really hard and hit it against my hand it went steady on, then Boom, it turned back off! The light bulb burned out! Great, I thought, this was just perfect, in the dark woods and completely bewildered on where I was exactly, and it fails me, well at least I have my phones small screen to light my way better than nothing at all I always say. I started walking and yelling in the direction I thought I came from, but no answer. I was beginning to become afraid. Really afraid, the best way to convey this feeling is like when you walk out of your home to do something at night and then the walk back inside where it feels like you are being followed and you run inside and slam the door to keep “it” from getting you, even though there was nothing in the first place. I kept going nonetheless. I guess i really didn’t have any choice, Five minutes more of walking and yelling still nothing. I was terrified now. What if I was lost what if they never found me, here is when fear started to kick in and I started to prepare my mind in case I had to wait out the night until they found me, or worse, what if they didn’t find me at all. this had become a physical and mental survival situation. My phone did not get service at all in this rural area either so that was no good. I did the only thing I thought I could do to help me right now.

                The wind ceased as I got on my knees to pray to god to help me find my way back. As soon as I got back up onto my feet I noticed the now still air began smelling mustier almost as if rotten eggs have been there for a very long time, and more dry than before. There were now sounds I could hear all around me. I began shaking, I was scared but I had faith it would all be alright. I mean what else did I have, right? If i lost it then i’d simply have nothing left. Just then I began to hear a sound, I stopped walking and listened, the sound sounded like and animal on all fours quick walking. And it was coming from the direction I was walking to. I stopped dead in my tracks and stood there paralyzed. I knew the thing, whatever it was, was nearing me, and rather fast. I suddenly came to and turned and did the only logical thing I could do, run!!

                As I ran, I was jumping obstacles like there was no tomorrow, my little skinny legs, carrying me as fast as I could go. I did not know what the thing was chasing me, but I did know it was gaining on me. I could soon hear the footsteps louder than ever! The sharp clanging of claws hitting the rocks and what seemed like a growl. A horribly deep growl, followed by the sound of a chain dragging not far behind. I thought, maybe someones dog got loose but Im not stupid and even in this instance I knew that was impossible! there wasn’t many people in this area to begin with so what would the odds be? I did not know how much time passed exactly but I guessed a couple minutes. As I ran I kept yelling all the group member names, “MICHAEL, BRIAN, JOSH, BRANDON!!!” but I still heard no reply. Then disaster struck! My foot caught and I fell, the animal or thing chasing me was now really close. I got lucky I kind of skidded on the floor sprawled like a cat but seamlessly picked myself up and kept running. I felt almost as if all I could do was run in a straight line because it sounded as if there were a pack of those animals on three of my four directions.

                Only now it was different, I ran but I could tell the thing was steps behind me. I could feel and smell its terrible stench. The hairs on my whole body stood on end as a warm air hit my neck. I could feel sharp stinging, not necessarily pain, but more of a scratch down my back as I ran. The thing was too close for comfort, and I tried picking up speed but I was too tired as now it seemed another eternity had passed. Luckily as I slowed so did the thing, I continued to yell. The only thing I didn’t understand was why this thing wouldn’t just kill and eat me being so close. I mean, Don’t get me wrong I didn’t mind if it let me live, and I really preferred it didn’t eat me, but it was always a possibility. Finally! I could hear Brian calling out, “Joe come back, where are you!” there was a panic in his voice Boy was I relieved. I shouted back, “I’m here! Help me!” Then it hit me. I was leading this thing to them. I knew it then, yet I still ran towards them. The thing was still here following and I was terrified. As I approached my friends I could hear the thing getting farther and farther away until finally I could not see it nor hear it anymore. Finally I saw the beams of light showing my way. My body collapsed. I had no idea what happened next, I had absolutely no control over my body. I can only assume i lost conciousness. I could, hear and feel, but I could not see, or move. I just knew all my friends were around me.

                I regained control many minutes later. My friends were around me the whole time I was on the ground, and Josh was holding my shirt. It had blood stains on the back and was torn, I didn’t know why right then. I was just relieved I was safe. No one brought up the subject until we were safe inside Josh's home once again. I was feeling sharp tingling pain down my back and my friends told me my back was clean they don’t know where the blood came from. Although they were curious about the 2 scar lines running diagonally, they could swear up and down they had never seen them before, not even Brian even though we had gone swimming a month or so ago. I shuddered. I told them I didn’t have any scars when we came out here. They all looked at me puzzled probably thinking I was joking, Josh said, “Quit fucking with us dude, those scars are fully healed they have to be at least a few months old” and i swore I wouldn’t joke with them like that. Their faces went to terror as they almost simultaneously asked what happened, I told them about the thing and how it was following me, as I told them about it, I watched them look at me in disbelief but I knew that they did believe me. My friends never doubted me, I know we all were scared and I had nightmares for a long time. 

                We are all still good friends. But no one has brought up the subject since then. We occasionally still go to Josh’s house but he no longer lives in that area. His parents built a house closer to the city i don’t know why they moved but i imagine ill ask sometime. I still wonder to this day what that thing was that followed me, why it did not kill me, was it good or evil. I like to think that god sent that thing after me to make me change direction and head the correct way to where I wanted to go, and to teach me a lesson for being stupid and playing in a very dangerous place at night. Whether it really is that or not I will never know, all i know is that if you ever want to play hide and seek in the forests of Utah at night… Don’t, please don’t, for your sake.

	Update: It is now 9 years later. Life has changed in ways I never thought imaginable. I got married last year and this year we just greeted our little dude into this world. I still am good friends with all my pals and their girlfriends. We had all rented an apartment together at 18 and I moved out to my own place when I got engaged to my now wife at 21. We all go camping often and I try to generally avoid the fishlake national forest. Well we all do. Josh told us his parents moved because they felt unsafe in the area (unrelated to my incident they never knew about what happened with us) they sold it to someone that loved the scenery from what we hear that house has changed owners at least 3 times since. The scar on my back is now super faded it looks just about normal.

		Well anyway lets go back to last year, my wife and I had just gotten married with all my pals as my groomsmen. The night ended and my wife and I both loved outdoors so we winged the entire honeymoon just as a big road trip and trying to stop at hotels each night. We left our reception at American Fork, Utah at 11, got in our Durango and drove south. My wife wanted to go through utahs scenic highway which made our first stop be at Salina, Ut. We arrived a bit past 1 a.m. and we found a little old rundown hotel to stay in during the night. The owners opened up and we decided it was to sketchy so we kept driving and found a nicer hotel about 30 min. South of the last. The Owner as soon as he saw my wife still in her dress told us he would let us use the nicer room queen size bed for the price of the cheap rooms. We were super greatful and we checked out at 11 a.m. the next morning. My wife loves aspen trees so this scenic highway was perfect. We would explore all day and crash at hotels at night. Obviously, doing the thing adults do at night during their honeymoon a whole lot. We may have even done that thing in the woods one day who knows? 

		4 days into the honeymoon, my dumbass lost track of time as we were exploring and, as luck would have it the sun started to go down, we weren’t too far from the Durango so we hurried got in and started driving to the next town. Once we got there it was 9 30 pm and all the hotels around were full and had no vacancy. I figured no big deal it was dark and I was tired but i could make it to the next town over. The next town was 23 min away according to gps. I got on the highway through the forest and drove on. Less than 10 min. in i was starting to nod off since it was so calming and boring as the road snaked through the woods. My wife mentioned she had to pee and there was a rest stop coming up so i got off and it was pitch black i put my highbeams on and pulled in front of the restrooms. There was already a small suv there. The couple was just sitting in their car and watched us intensely as we hopped out. There was something off and we noticed it as we approached the restrooms. 

		There was woods all around us and the rest stop was essentially a dead end culdesac like a roundabout. My wife and I felt uneasy and the woods were silent which we learned a long time ago is never a good thing. The couple from the car came out, and I saw they weren’t too old either perhaps late 20’s and the man was twice my size. He said, “Hey hold on a sec bud.” I turned to face him and became protective of my wife, he may be twice my size but I wasn’t going down without a fight. He then said, “We’ve been sitting here like 10 min. but something isn’t right and i want to know if your wife can accompany my wife while we stand guard then we will each go in real quick.” I figured it was strange but i agreed. I know he was a total stranger but I believed him and sensed he was telling the truth. So the girls hurried in and we hear a small rustle he is visibly spooked and I assured him it was probably a small animal. I ask him how long they’ve been out here and he says about 30 min. but then he went quiet… Okay weird i thought. Then I pressured him a bit more, “Did something happen? Or is something wrong?” He just nodded no then said I think my mind is playing tricks on me. I kept prying, and he finally got a look of defeat. And said promise not to call me crazy. I simply nodded and he began.

		He had been in the last town as us and was headed to the next town as well. He was a truck driver so it should have been no issue but all the same he got tired around the same stretch of road. He said he began to fall in and out of sleep and his wife had fallen asleep and he could not get her awake to help him by keeping a conversation. He resigned and pulled into the rest stop and decided he would nap for a few min. then continue on his way. He fell asleep and woke up to an incessant scratching like nails on a chalk board. He looked up and saw a dark tall and skinny shadow outside his door and his wife woke up and immediately became paralyzed, and thats when we pulled in the rest area and shone our lights onto his car. He said the shadow retreated, and he said follow me as he walked me to his car’s door and it had 2 deep scratches in the paint not too damaging but eerie all the same. 

		The girls came out and my wife looked like she had just seen a ghost. I automatically assumed that the other woman told her the same story. My urge to use the restroom was non existent any longer and I told him to go use it real quick all the while our highbeams illuminated us. The girls hopped into the cars and the man went to tinkle real quick. I was exhausted but i had no intention of staying here any longer and told him so. I suggested we both ride out and help keep each other awake by honking if we veered out of lanes or doing small races for fun just to stay entertained a bit, he immediately agreed. We rode out onto the highway again and the whole time I felt like the aspen trees all had eyes and like they were watching us but we did as planned and kept each other up until we arrived safely to a hotel. It was One of the creepiest nights to this day.

		We completely avoid driving through there these days, if I need to get somewhere i take the long way around but never go through anymore.. There is something in Fishlake forest Utah. And I now know I wasn’t crazy all those years ago. Other people have seen it too. Though many will say this is made up, I know the truth and I know many others do as well. Maybe its not out there to get just anyone, maybe those of us who have seen or run into something strange there have something in common? Or maybe there are just things that we can’t explain, either way, at least i know you have been warned. And with that my conscious will sleep just fine knowing I live far far from that place. "

In light of the the past couple of weeks I feel like Christmas is here again. In keeping with the spirit I have decided to re\-post my rendition.

\*\*\*The Night Before Trumpmas\*\*\*

Twas the week before Christmas at the DNC,

Everyone was crying and screaming Reeeeeeee;

The US flags were burning because Liberals don't care,

In hopes that soon socialism soon would soon be there

The interns we nestled all snug in Conyers' bed,

as visions of Russian collusion danced in their heads;

Clinton was deleting E\-mails, Franken was gropin a sleeping lass,

And John Podesta had just settled down to a piece of 13 year old ass

All of a sudden CNN was a chatter,

Bill Clinton stopped raping his intern to see what was the matter;

A man was on the TV talking about patriotic zen,

At that moment Bill though, ""Shit, he's going to make America great again"";

The sun was rising on the new American dawn,

Returning the nation to greatness it should have had all along;

When, to my wondering eyes what should appear,

One of America's greatest sons, who didn't do drugs or beer

With a god\-like presence that told all he couldn't be stumped,

In a moment Bill knew, it had to be Trump;

More rapid than bald eagles, his cabinet they came,

He tweeted, and shouted, and called them by name

""Now Mattis!, Now Mnuchin!, Now Pompeo!, and Kelly"",

""On McMahon, on Sessions, On Carson, and Haley"";

""Find all the illegals and deport them all!"",

""Once they are out, BUILD THAT FUCKING WALL!""

And then, in a pivot, the elite he did scorn,

He said with a grin ""It's time for tax reform"";

He slashed the tax brackets from seven to four,

and said ""You think that's all, just wait, there is more""

""Ninety\-five percent of homes will see their tax fall"",

""Two\-income households under $50K will pay nothing at all!"";

The Dems watched in horror as their breath did abate,

As Trump proclaimed loudly ""Fuck the individual mandate""

He was dressed in a fine suit from his head to his feet,

And he attacked all his enemies an epic tweet;

He called out the spineless Senate cuck Mitch McConnell,

And also that Hollywood lardass O'Donnell

Clinton did ask ""Why am I not fifty points ahead"",

Huma said ""that would require you to get out of bed"";

The DNC then killed a man who exposed this corrupt witch,

To this day we still say ""His name was Seth Rich""

At the debate Clinton insisted that Trump a racist,

Trump pointed out that Bill Clinton is a rapist;

""Thankfully you're not the law"" Clinton did rail,

Trump simply responded ""because you'd be in jail""

Election day came, and the media did fawn,

""The exit poll predicted Hillary has won"";

But the polls were wrong and only  Conway had the knowledge,

And soon Trump BTFO of the Electoral College

Trump Took office with out a wage nor any pomp,

And swore to the nation ""I will drain the swamp"";

Trump got to work, a proclamation he did pen,

it read ""Merry Christmas to all let's MAGA again"""

---
Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
8j4yd2,107,2018-05-13,Is this the end?,poor_icarus,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/8j4yd2/is_this_the_end/,"I have a FWB. He is the only man in my life. And there was no one before him. I'm twenty, he is in his thirties. We live one hour apart from each other and we only see each other on weekends.

Well, the relationship started idyllically, but then there was this huge fight, which I'm ashamed to admit that I was the one who instigated it. 

Basically, I was mad at him because I claimed he only saw me as ""easy sex."" I threw some nasty words, he threw some nasty words back at me. 

But, I've come to realize, what I thought is not true at all. 

It took me too long to see that he tried his best to offer the other side of a relationship, you know? In our short time of knowing each other, we even had a real date, and when it was just a sleepover, he treated me real nice. 

Well, after the fight, we didn't see each other. He was busy with work, I was busy with college. But through text messages, we apologized to each other. 

Everything should be going well now, right? 

But then I suddenly realized that my semester was ending, like, really soon. I would be going back to my hometown, then I would start my internship in a different city. I didn't look at the calendar all this time, and, so much time was wasted fighting.

So I texted him -- could we meet? Please? One last time.

He was busy with work, he's a real busy man, but late at night, he drove an hour to my place, and we met at a toll booth on the highway. 

Just seeing him again after the fight went down, it made me feel something nice again. When I'm apart from him, I always forget just how handsome he is in person, how kind those eyes. 

At first, the conversation was awkward, because, hell, we were on the roadside, there were cars passing us every second.

But then he did his magic and we were talking again, like, how was life? What's the next step in your life?

Ok, now is the weird part -- I cried a lot for him throughout our relationship, but I never told him this. But somehow, he just knew, you know? 

He said, what would become of you when you go far away in your future? Would you cry? Then he started playfully punching me in my shoulder and in my chest, and right then I felt between us that bliss again -- something I thought was lost forever.

He had work to do, so I couldn't hold him there forever on that roadside, but before he left, he offered a hug, and I hugged him hard, arms wrapped around him, face buried in his chest. I almost cried. Even though I was always so guarded. 

And  I didn't let go, you know? 

The cars passing by honked at us -- at the two men hugging each other. Did I mention I live in Malaysia? Where people go to jail for being gay? Well, yeah, in that moment, I didn't care, there were just us in this world. It was like a scene from a movie, I swear.

Before he left, I waved him goodbye, and he waved back. My drive back was silent. I didn't want to turn on the radio, because I didn't want my memory of him tainted. 

I would redo all the bad parts of our relationship just for that roadside hug again. He drove one hour to me and one hour back just to give me a hug. Oh man, I feel like crying again now. 

I don't know if I'll see him again, you know? Being in different cities. I don't know when I'll be back. Could be later this year, could be next year, and I don't know if it's to stay. 

And in that time apart, I wonder if we would become different people, and would the feeling still be alive then? How do I keep us connected? 

I want to say leaving him hurts like hell, but at the same time, I'm just so happy, so grateful, that I was given the chance to get to know him. 

I'm not confident that any other man I meet after him will be as good, I really mean it. I strongly feel this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

A chance to get their hands on your perfect body and they're putty in your hands, it doesn't hurt that you can guarantee the best fuck they'll ever have too. Young or old, married or single, regardless of their appearance, as long as they can give you what you want, you can give them what they want.

Actress, singer, wrestler, even on youtube... whatever profession you choose, there's plenty of opportunity to climb using men.

A few specific ideas I had in mind:

Zelina Vega deciding she needs a new prospect to manage, seducing and controlling a guy twice the size of her.

Alexa Bliss convincing the head writer that she belongs in the title scene.

Charli XCX getting her new record deal.

Suzy Berhow making sure the new intern at the grumpspace knows who's really in charge.

Sarah Silverman proving she deserves more than just comedy roles with a serious agency.

Of course any celebrity or scene you think of, let me know and I'll definitely consider it. As always, priority will be given to people willing to change their name and/or pic, but that's not required.

Posted this once, got a couple of upvotes but no responses. Looking to see if there's anything I can tweak. Thanks for your thoughts. 
***
Everyone at Southern Louisiana University of Teaching and Service knew the top sorority was Kappa Upsilon Mu. They raised the most money in the annual charity drive, they’d won the beach volleyball tournament four years in a row, held the best parties, and maintained the highest GPA on campus. And they were connected; being a sister at Kappa Upsilon Mu opened all kinds of doors. A KUM girl would have her pick of internships and could count on multiple job offers at graduation. 

Naturally, competition to get in was fierce and there was a rigorous if strangely secretive process. You had the GPA, the extracurricular activities. You’d made it through the first two rounds, a rather dizzying session of brief introductions and chats with KUM members, and then a somewhat longer session including a tour of the house. Now they’d asked you back for a third round. Alone. Although there were of course strict policies against hazing these days, you couldn’t help feeling a little nervous. But being accepted into KUM would be worth it, whatever it took. 

And so you went to the house. Remembering the advice you’d read on dressing nicely, you’d put on a sundress and sandals with a modest heel, along with tasteful makeup. When you arrived at the house, Beth and Lexi, two of the members you’d met before invited you. “Thanks for coming,” Lexi said, “We’ve really enjoyed talking with you earlier. However, we have a particular culture at KUM and we want to make sure new members will fit in. So follow me, please.” 

They took you down to the basement, a part of the house you hadn’t seen before. The floor was carpeted, with cushions of varying sizes strewn around. But what captured your attention was the five men standing in a row. Naked. All looked like they might be members of the swim team. They smiled when they saw you walk in.

Lexi took out her phone. “This is your first test to see if you have what it takes to be part of KUM. You have ten minutes to get them off. You can tell them what to do, but all five have to cum on you or in you in the time allotted to pass the challenge. I’ll give you a minute to prepare, and when I say, “Go!” your time starts. 
***
Let’s just say KUM’s recruitment methods would not be approved by the Panhellenic Council. Not a story with a lot of buildup here. I have a few similar challenges in mind after this one to take you through the process of joining KUM, all focusing on public and risky play, a fair amount of group stuff, and of course, lots of cum. I’ll handle the various guys. I had been thinking your character would know exactly what joining KUM meant and would be enthusiastic about it, but if you want to play more surprised and reluctant that’s perfectly OK with me. 

If this appeals to you please respond with some information about your character (including her name and description), your thoughts about what you’d like to do with this story, and a little continuation of the scene. Feel free to ask any questions as well. See my [profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/4xhj26/m4f_inventing_dreams/) for more information about what I'm into.

Problem — I currently intern and work a part time job. I make only about $400 a week between both jobs. I have $14k in savings, and my apartment lease is up soon, so my girlfriend and I will be moving and inevitably need to pay a deposit.  

Should I look into getting another car, or stick with what I’ve got? I’m on the fence. I don’t so much have the money for a new car, but this has become a bit expensive... but not as expensive as insurance on a new car and a monthly payment would be.

After freshman year he contacted me over the summer and decided to transfer here without me asking. I introduced him to all of my friends who thought he was off-putting at first. Introduced him to his roommate. I helped him find a job at school, emotionally supported him when he was sad, helped him out in the accounting department of my school and told him all the due dates. I'm the only reason he has an internship and a passing gpa. I helped him so much and thought we were genuinely in love. He started acting distance months ago. I did everything I could to make it work. I changed who I was as a person. A couple days ago he told me that ""it's good for him to get a change"" and ""we don't click"" and that I just wasnt good for him. Naturally I was devastated. I spent a day in bed crying while he went out and partied with MY FRIENDS that i introduced him to. My sadness turned into anger when I realized how much he had used me. I collected all his shit, tore through an old sweater he gave me with a knife, and stormed over to his place. I demanded all the stuff I bought him, which I realized was half of the things in his room. I was so angry. I'm not usually a crazy emotional person but I smashed a picture frame he had with all of our letters on his carpet. The 300 dollar textbooks I lent him so he didn't have to pay for his own when he took the classes. I told him I wasn't leaving. He screamed at me that I was crazy. I sat in the corner and lost my sht. I stayed there sobbing uncontrollably and he brought me some alcohol. Before I knew it I was drunk. I wasn't going to leave his room because I was feeling unhinged and I knew if I left he would lock the door, block my number. He just kept saying ""if you thought you had any chance of getting back together with me it's fking gone"" while I sat there crying telling him that he would have to call the cops if he wanted me out of his apartment. Eventually he got drunk too. We had sex and I hardly remember it. I woke up the next day and crawled into the corner to remain for the day. I wasn't going to leave. Next think I know he is slinging the doors open with his roommate (my friend) on the couch outside listening and he starts screaming ""GET THE FK OUT OF MY APARTMENT"" and bruising my wrists. I was naked and he picked me up and tried to drag me out. I started screaming and put my clothes on. Thats how my morning started. i left his apartment, blocked his number, cried. I thought this person loved me. I'm not a trashy person, I come from a great middle-class family. Yelling and screaming like this was foreign to my childhood. I just felt something overcome me that caused that. I felt humiliated today. As I'm sitting on my front porch, drinking and smoking a cigarette, I see him come to the pool not yards from my apartment complex. Several of my friends shuffle in and I realize that he has invited all of the friends I have introduced him to to a party outside my apartment. He waves me down. Not 2 hours after he dragged me screaming out of his apartment. I'm in my room right now listening to them playing in the pool. I want to make his life hell. I want to hurt him in an irrevocable way. I don't know what to do, I don't know who else to talk to. I'm hoping someone with a similar experience can give me some advice or at least relate to me in any way. I want to ruin his life, or destroy his car or break his windows. I hate him so much. I don't know what to do."
8j7cld,0,2018-05-13,I am extremely envious and jealous of my boyfriend and it is destroying our relationship.,toomuchenvy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8j7cld/i_am_extremely_envious_and_jealous_of_my/,"To get it straight, envy is my biggest weakness, and I can never stand being with anyone that is better than I am (in terms of intelligence/career). Whenever I come across someone whom I perceive is a better individual than me, I'll run away from him/her as far as possible, otherwise the envious fire at my heart would burn me to death. I fell in love with a guy who I thought was equal/lesser than me. But ever since he entered chiropractic school a year ago, his success has skyrocketed. He joined a highly exclusive fraternity that not only gives him tons of friends, but also gives him tons of connections. There are plenty of millionaire alumni of his organization who will gladly hire him once he graduates. He keeps mostly everything they do a secret because it is so ""exclusive"". He is the best adjuster in his class, and consequently, he is going to do the best internship that his school offers (they only select one person). He also has gone to El Salvador, not once, not twice, but three times with his fraternity to provide chiropractic care to those in need. He also just started doing stocks and is quite successful at it. Everybody at his school is extremely impressed by him. He is definitely going to be very successful one day. He has admitted to me that he is going to make millions of dollars. This is weird to me because last year he was just an average guy who partied all the time and didn't get good grades.

Now a little about myself: I am younger than my boyfriend, I just finished my sophomore year of undergrad (math/econ major). I work a summer job that pays 10.25/hour but I am gaining experience from it. Because I go to such a large school, I really have no name for myself. I have no friends, no family, nothing exciting to do. I am not in any clubs, I rushed a business fraternity and got rejected. I've tried joining other things but the clubs are my school are just so cliquey and dead. All I do is go to class, go to work, and go to the gym. I feel like I have nothing going for me. I honestly feel like a complete loser. I am not only envious of my boyfriend's success, but I am also angry because while he was in undergrad, he didnt even have to lift a finger and now he is going to be a millionaire. I actually try and I feel like i am going nowhere.

My envy has caused a lot of drama because I can't stand the fact that I'm inferior to my boyfriend. It would help if he just made me feel equal to him by at least PRETENDING that I am on his level. I told him that we should work as a team more-- as in set goals for US and not ourselves individually. (For example, he is starting his third trimester at school on monday and he set a bunch of goals for himself (3.8 GPA, work out everyday, go to El Salvador AGAIN, make connections, go to every frat meeting, etc). I told him that we should set goals for US so we can both feel equal to eachother and like a team ex: we BOTH get good grades, we BOTH workout everyday, we BOTH have good attendance at work/activities). However, it took many fights to ingrain this idea into his head-- he said a true ""teammate"" is somebody who makes him happy. Yes, people in a relationship automatically make each other happy... I am looking for MORE than that.

Due to my insecurities, I get triggered by the smallest things, EVERYTHING he says/does makes me suspicious that he is talking down to me and treating me as less than his equal. He SAYS he doesn't think low of me, but his actions speak louder than words. In our fights, he has admitted that he is ""clearly"" more accomplished than me. A lot of the time, he does treat me as a lesser being than him. He automatically assumes that he works much harder than me, and always tells me what I should do with my ""free time"" instead of calling him, as if he just assumes I sit in bed all day waiting for his calls. He told me that because I am not as busy as him, I should be cheering him on. I told him that this is not what I want, I want to be just as busy as my partner and work as a team because it makes me feel equal and he called me selfish. He said teammates do that the other person wants. He said that he wants to financially contribute 75%, while his partner only contributes 25%. He said that he wants to be more successful than whoever he ends up with, therefore he must think that he is more successful than me. He is always the one helping me with things, and he never takes my advice/asks me for help. I talked to him about this, and he started asking me to do things for him to make me feel better about myself, charity work. This just made me feel even worse about myself.

I usually date someone that is equal to me or slightly dumber than me so that I can feel I'm in control. My boyfriend's superiority makes me insecure and vulnerable. I shiver whenever seeing his grandiose accomplishments. I remember someone said, ""envy's true nature is the will to completely destroy the envied""—do I want to destroy my boyfriend then? Well, yes, I do RESENT him for having talents that I don't have. Yet at the same time I'm in love with him. Yes, I love AND hate him simultaneously! Such feeling is too much to handle. Ugh. I don't think I can leave him, because we love eachother so deeply. If I could get rid of my envy, everything would be fine. But how can I do it? This bad trait of mine is so ingrained in me. I always uncontrollably compare myself with others. I can't help it. Please don't say, ""everyone has his/her talents and defects. You are equal to your boyfriend because you have talents too."" Yes, I do have several talents he doesn't have. But from what I perceive, my boyfriend has MORE talents than I do. He is superior to me MORE OFTEN than I am to him. I can't stand this. Meanwhile, I wish I could eradicate my envy and have a wonderful relationship with this guy.

TL;DR: Boyfriend used to be average, now he is in chiropractic school and is extremely successful-- he is in an exclusive fraternitiy and therefore has tons of friends, connections and opportunities. I get rejected from a greek organization, I work an okay job, and I have no friends/family. My boyfriend SAYS he doesnt think low of me, but his actions say otherwise-- he is always helping me/giving me advice and he never takes my advice or asks me for help. He automatically assumes that he works much harder than me, and always tells me what I should do with my ""free time"" instead of calling him, as if he just assumes I sit in bed all day waiting for his calls. I am naturally a competitive, envious person. We eally do love eachother and I start all of our fights. I want to get rid of this envy so we can both be happy."

I'm really bad at socializing and am trying to get better.

I'm at a company where average age is 40+ and anyone who is around my age is married and/or has kids so they never really have time to hang out or game. We have interns or new hires but we barely hang out or game.

What I'm looking for is someone to either game with or if you're local, someone IRL? I don't know, anyone really

About Me:

- Currently game on PC, PS4, and XBOX but primarily PS4

- I enjoy games ranging from Assassin's Creed to TLOU to Overwatch to Bloodborne, I'll give anything a try. I do not enjoy smash 'em ups

- I do swear a ton, but if you're uncomfortable with that let me know

- I watch a variety of shows ranging from Eureka 7 to Parks and Rec to ATLA/Korra. Currently rewatching ATLA since the blu ray just released

- I am a fairly big gaming merchandise fan and I love me some statues

- I've been to PAX East several times and cosplay

- I love scary/horror/suspense movies, still waiting to find the movie that really terrifies me

- I do have discord and am on that very frequently

If you're a local, I can share IRL hobbies too. 

Sorry for the length, I can shorten it.

EDIT 22:46 - Heading off for the night, if I get any messages overnight I'll respond to them in the morning. Thanks for all the responses so far!!"

I can't put into words how much of a hole it's left in me. Every waking moment feels like torture.  

I wanted to let you know that I finished my first year at university. You were right, it's was the right thing to do going back now I'm older. I finished with a 1st, and ive got an internship at a great company. 

It just doesn't feel right without you though. I just want to ring you up and here your voice. I want you to tell me you love me, to tell me you're proud. 

My mind's not been so great again. I think my depression is coming back again. I can't sleep. I spend nearly every night either crying or staring at the wall feeling empty. I feel like I'm just on auto pilot, not really controlling anything, just going through the motions, watching from above.

Dad's having trouble. He's trying to act all tough, you know how he is. He's putting all his time into work, I think he just wants s distraction. Every now and then when I visit, I hear him singing your wedding song under his breath. It makes me feel even worse seeing him like this. I've tried  talking to him, he doesn't want to have the conversation. 

Your grandson speajs now, he says dad, mum and grandad. He even says nanny, but it breaks my heart to hear it. 

I don't know why I'm rambling or why I'm writing this. Its a rough night, the crying won't stop and I someone told me that it might help. 

I just feel like I'm falling apart. Every now and then I forget and see something and I'm like ""mum would love that"" and then it sinks in. You're gone. And you're never coming back. 

I think the biggest thing is I never got to say goodbye. So, mum. I hope if you're out there, you're finally able to walk. I hope your running. I hope your happy. I miss you. Goodbye."

8j8dg2,354,2018-05-13,Worst college mentor award goes to...,brnbabybrn,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8j8dg2/worst_college_mentor_award_goes_to/,"Edit: the MLM down-voters are a plage here! Wow! This post's votes are going up and down like crazy! 

Back to the story:
Just found this sub through the front page today, and realized what I see a lot of here has happened to me. It was awful, I was a college student when this happened to Me and my friends. 

MLM: World Financial Group 

Our college assigns us professional mentors in our field who are graduates of the program, and are successful in the field. This was great, I had a few, and one decided she liked my personality and we hung out a few times, and she helped me here and there. 

One day, she calls me and asks if I would be interested in a job at her Business. ""Wow! Not an internship, a job!"" I thought, big deal for a kid still in college. 

I knew she had a non-profit that had done great work overseas, so was so excited she wanted me to join the team.  This Was my dream job. 

She never went into specifics and technically just told me it was a job and she'd be happy to mentor me yada yada. So she wasn't lying, just omitting. A lot. And being misleading. Very misleading. 

She also told me to come to a party they were having next weekend, and I could learn about the business more. Not being suspicious of my college mentor, I was thinking small office BBQ or something. 

I have a very unimportant meeting with my aunt and uncle later, which will be important later, so I told her I could only come for a bit. Oh, totally fine, she says. 

So this was before I had Google maps showing me what business resided where I typed in, and just guided me the way, and I also wasn't familiar with the smaller cities within my big city, so when she said ""123 Main street, mayberry"" I was a little confused, but being 19/20, just trusted it and went. As I got closer i realized I was being taken into a rough part of town. The final destination turned out to be a big megachurch's offices, Which balanced out the rough neighborhood, and I felt more safe. I guessed her office had moved or just rented a room for a big party, because I also see a LOT of people parking and walking in. Around 100, all foreign, which is important later also. 

So I call her and tell her I'm there, and she meets me at the door and introduces me to a man that I've never seen in my life, as her boss. I know most of the people and types of people my local industry works with, and this dude is ABSOLUTELY NOT the type. (no, It's not a race thing, or gender thing, it's a subtle personality and dress thing)

I'm starting to get a weird feeling... but I'm young and Was raised by immigrants, so I don't know a thing about american business,  and just go along for the ride(my normal MO when American things happen to me lol)

Once inside, I get introduced to...More bosses. This is very strange. At one boss I should've seen a red flag, as this was supposedly her business we were there for, but like 5 people? Now I saw the red flag, and was starting to realize shit was about to get weird. A presentation was announced and so begin the chants and cheers and clapping and basically hype. Young me is dumbfounded...What the hell? Their first presentation starts and the sign reads World Financial Group. Uhm......wow

I had met an ACTUAL employee of hers who was also brought here and went to sit by him to ask him wtf was going on. He basically told me we got suckered into a pyramid scheme meeting. 

FUCK

The mentor I'm here with is a super popular woman, generally nice and helpful, and cool, and now I have to sit through this crazy meeting. I decided to stay a little while so she doesn't get in trouble. Dumb mistake. 

As were all separated into a smaller rooms with different""leaders"" they start a PowerPoint and presentation about product bullshit and I'm beginning to notice a lot of hype, big dollar signs, vague definition of their ""product"", and scare tactics being thrown in these peoples faces. It's a little funny and bearable because I'm sitting by my new friend again, and we just keep muttering bs to each other and amusing ourselves through this shit. Then I realize most of them are also foreign. Some don't speak English well. Most are old. This damn MLM is preying on older foreign people who don't know any better! And they're eating every Scare tactic and promise of big earnings up! 

I also realize the lady was also the daughter of immigrants, and brought her parents into this mess too. They were there selling shit too!

The raging cherry on top: the head boss(whatever you call the biggest boss, out of probably 10, as per stnd MLM practice) was a (*edit)non-foreign american business man type dude. One of the only white people in the room. Infuriating.

At this point I'm no longer There to appease the mentor, I have loads so I figure fuck this, I'm out of here. 

I am close to the front and jammed up against the wall in a tiny row of seats, so as I get up, everyone looks at me and the presenter asks ""oh honey what's wrong?"" (Like she actually gives a shit) and I just say I could only stay a while, I told [mentor] I had to meet my aunt and uncle after this. And she acts sad and lets me go. 

My escape plan is hindered a bit as I get out into the central area, because come to find out, my mentor and all the higher ups are out there to catch any runners like myself. 

They run up to me ""is everything ok?!"" They also say, as if they care about anything other than the $50 they each get for me showing up. 

""I told you I had a meeting with my aunt and uncle, remember? I'm late already, so I really need to go"" I said. 

These. Fuckers. Corner me. A tiny college student. They also try to convince me to lie to my aunt and uncle by feeding me stories I could tell them on why I can't make it today. 

That made me mad. And also sad, it was at this point I had that feeling in my chest of ""oh shit, I'm never going to talk to you again"" to my mentor. That all-around 180 of feelings, from admiration and friendship to Total loss of respect and disgust.  

Luckily when someone tells me I CANT do something, it always ends up in me proving them wrong and accomplishing it. So I break out of the ring and say that bs ""sorry, gotta go, ttyl love you xoxo"" girls say to make the other happy, and I'm off like a dress in prom night. 

As I left, I called my uncle to tell them I'd be late, but end up crying, and caved in and told them about what had just happened, and he was telling me not to feel stupid and just get to their house. I get there and they're telling me all about their past experiences with MLMs. I felt a lot better, and my important meeting with them(painting with me uncle ;) ) turns my day around. 

The worst part of this whole story is that I contacted the professor in charge of his all, not using names, and told him about it, waring him she isn't fit to be a mentor since she basically lied to me and tried to Intentionally financially harm me for her own benefit. 

He replied with her name and said that yes, he's aware of her strange new endeavors and is finding it hard to keep her away from Campus As she's an easy mentor to bring in for reviews and such. 
Found out later she Did this to two more girls, and had done it at least once prior. 

Tldr: College mentor preyed on me, as well as at least 2-3 other mentees to join an aggressive MLM. 

Edited to call out the MLM by name and include more clarity.

T. Richards  

I like to watch people—okay, that sounds a little creepy. But really, I thoroughly enjoy people\-watching. I have this mild obsession with imagining what these rand\-os might be like. If they’re kind, intelligent, awkward, or if they’re the kind of people who complain about their food at a restaurant. Are they talented? In love? Lonely? What do they do for a living? You get the picture. Sometimes I wonder if they notice me and imagine what I’m like. I wonder how far off they are, then I wonder how far off I am.

I do most of my people\-watching at the local coffee place—cliché, I know. But I like how they call out customers’ names when their orders are ready. So, I play this game where I guess the names of my subjects while creating their personas in my mind—well, in my mind and in my notes. Okay, okay, again, I swear I’m not creepy. I just like note\-taking while people\-watching. Not creepy.

The name game was how I found out that “Madison” was actually Emily, and “Jacob” was, in fact, Joseph \(I was close, sort of!\). After realizing my lack of name\-guessing skills, I had this new idea that I would test my persona\-creating skills. That’s how I met Kate.

So, I’m sitting in my usual spot in the corner, by the window. It’s the optimal people\-watching location. I have the perfect view of any customers, as well as the people outside. I open my notepad and begin stirring an ungodly amount of sugar into my coffee—which I do not need. I’m super anxious about my plans to converse with a stranger, but who am I to turn down caffeine? Coffee\-drinking is a must while people\-watching and note\-taking, after all . In walks “Madison\-Emily.” I had thought about introducing myself to one of my—I mean, the coffee shop’s—regulars, but if things got awkward, I’d have to see them again and most likely exchange uncomfortable pleasantries \(unpleasantries, if you will\) for the rest of our lives…or, you know, until one of us stops coming here. I flip through my notes to the “Madison\-Emily” page and refresh myself on my previous assessments \(assumptions\) of “Madison\-Emily.”

*“Madison.” 20ish, blonde, skinny, tall, beautiful. Manages to still look girly in t\-shirts and jeans. Perky. Is/was a cheerleader. Super friendly, but don’t get on her bad side. Dog person. Decent tipper. Smiles at strangers. Smiled at me. Actually Emily.*

*Avid user of social media. Uses dog filter on snapchat. Single, but definitely mingles. Popular with the guys. Going to school to be a kindergarten teacher. Parents are still together. Nice house and nice car, but not too lavish. Lots of friends, her phone is constantly buzzing.* 

*Stressed, possibly because of school. Tired. Boyfriend? Sad?*

My notes on “Madison\-Emily” had taken a slight turn the last time I saw her, so I was interested to see if she was feeling better. And, sure enough, she was back to her bright, smiling self.

*Aces her exams. Smart.*

A couple hours have gone by \(I’ve switched to decaf\), and so far I’ve watched “Madison\-Emily,” “Paige,” who is actually Jenny, “Patrick,” who is actually Ben, “Alyssa,” who is actually Amanda \(hey, I was close again!\), and several others come and go. I’m beginning to accept the fact that  I’m way too much of a pussy to actually talk to someone. It’s been a little while since more customers walked in, so I’ve resorted to window\-shopping. It’s raining heavily outside. Those fortunate enough to be prepared have donned their raincoats and umbrellas. Like “Lisa,” 40\-ish, realtor. Others like “Steve,” 25\-ish, intern, are running by, using their briefcases for shelter. I spot “Anthony” across the street. Haven’t seen him since—

“More coffee?” I jump, startled and, as a reflex, cover my notepad. I look up to see an unfamiliar face. Our eyes meet, and I start to answer, but I’m at a loss of words. She is positively stunning, but not in the same way as “Madison\-Emily.” Her hair is jet\-black, clearly not her natural color, but it suits her. It’s barely long enough to be in a pony tail, so it kind of looks like the end of a paintbrush. *And those eyes.* Her eyes are blue—no, they’re green? I can’t decide, but they’re somewhere in the very beautiful middle.

“Don’t worry, I’m not going to sneak a peek of your diary!” She smiles, revealing perfect teeth.

I realize I’ve just held eye contact with another human being for longer than I possibly ever have, and I have to slightly shake myself back to reality. “Yes, please!” My reply is a little too excited, and I’m immediately horrified at myself. “Thanks,” I say, the tone of my voice a verbal slap to the forehead. She refills my coffee, and I notice her name tag: Kate. *I was so busy being in awe of her that I forgot about the name game.* 

“No problem.” Kate flashes her pearly whites at me and then she’s gone. I go for the notepad.

*Kate. Somewhere between 20 and 25 years old. Possibly the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen…*

I ponder. I watch her work.

After an hour of Kate\-watching. I have nada. She seems friendly enough, but I can’t tell if it’s the “I’m being friendly because I’m at work and I have to” kind\-of\-friendly or not. I’m absolutely mesmerized by this person. I normally have no problem characterizing my subjects, but I just can’t figure her out.

It hits me that I’m not interested in making up a “Kate.” I want to know the *real* Kate. 

3 MONTHS LATER

“Moment of truth. Let’s see how these turned out,” Kate says. She’s sitting on her bed, looking through photographs—turns out she’s an unbelievably talented photographer. That’s just one of the *real* things I’ve learned about Kate over the past few months. She’s an art major with a group of equally interesting and talented friends. She has a fat cat named Gordo, whom she loves more than anything. She’s an only child. She drives a beat\-up station wagon. She reads a lot. Oh! And she’s a redhead now \(according to the pictures in her room, she’s experimented with just about everyone hair color\). I could go on and on. Kate has become my best friend, but I still haven’t told her just how much meeting her has really meant to me, or how amazing I think she is. 

“Ugh.” She slings her photographs across the bed, onto the floor. She never sees just how special her art is—or how special she is, for that matter. I want to pick them up and tell her how talented she is, but I just watch instead. “Garbage, again. I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking that I’m too hard on myself.”

I nod. It’s true. She is *way* too hard on herself.

She hops off the bed and gathers her pictures from the floor. “I’ll revisit them tomorrow when I’m feeling better. Goodnight.” She ends the call and tosses her phone onto her bed, where she plops down next to it.

“Goodnight,” I say, my hand pressed against her the outside of her window. I bend over and collect my notepad from the ground, before taking one last look at Kate. She’s turning off her bedside lamp as I whisper, “I’ll see you tomorrow, Kate.”"

Now you could just say that he’s done and we will never see him again but I think Horikoshi still has plans for him. I personally think he lost his arms to teach him real humility and that he will return as an anti-hero and get some redemption. I can see this happening in two ways, first when Tomura starts using his serum the hero accociation use him to produce the antidote and second the prison is lax on him because they think he is quirckless now, he somehow manages to learn to use his quirck his his feet or stumps and escapes to get revenge on Tomura.

8j917j,1,2018-05-13,The Death Watcher,annabunny2,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8j917j/the_death_watcher/,"I posted about this in the mothers day thread (check my history if you're interested) about being anxious and resentful towards my mom in general and especially after dropping money I didn't have to support her by going on a trip to meet her estranged dad, who was actually very nice, who was going into hospice, but today was a very good day. She was genuinely kind, no back handed compliments, no passive aggressive comments, just simple. 

She even said she wanted a graduation pic of me because college cap and gown photos are rare in our family. Pretty straight forward!

I even spent some time with my cousin and her who I used to be much closer with but acts like a FM or just her own brand of ncousin. 

This wasn't even following a confrontation, but unfortunately was right after her dad passed away last night. 

I'm going to take this for the good that it is, I know that my mom is somewhere on that sliding scale of nmom's and life is too short to deny genuinely loving moments existed, even in a complicated relationship. 

When my ndad died a few years ago, we hadn't been talking prior to him going into hospice, but the 5 weeks or so he was there, I was there every day. We managed to squash everything very quickly and sit peacefully and quietly in each other's presence, we used to butt heads like rams on the discovery channel. A few years later I started to volunteer and eventually did an internship in hospice. The last few years changed mine and my fiance's lives completely. 

I had a vague understanding of death, but I never felt its final weight until it was my turn to hold it. I had complicated grief for a long time, I still sometimes do, and even tried to be closer to my mom but she really didn't empathize with how I was feeling. When I was with her out of state to visit her father who was dying, I tried talking to her about it, like my own feelings and how crazy I got, and constantly got the ""I know"" response, but I think now she feels the weight in her own hands. 

I hope she will talk to me about it and I've invited her to. One thing I definitely pride myself on is being ""The Death Watcher"" of both sides of my family. When I was a kid I was always afraid to die, now I sit with strangers who are dying, talk to their families, read about it, and I'm not afraid to talk about it or hear about it. I hope she feels comfortable coming to me and talking to me about it. I have the space to make for it and will listen. F*ck, I flew across the country with money I don't have to meet someone I don't know who's about to die so she didn't have to be alone lol 

P.S. if any of you all just want to talk about your own experiences with death with a stranger, yo. "
8j91b4,3,2018-05-13,I am severely depressed and I am in despair,Iaamu,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8j91b4/i_am_severely_depressed_and_i_am_in_despair/,"I made a reddit account just so I could make this post in hopes of receiving advice from someone. I am sorry for the length of this to anyone that reads it but I just need to vent everything because I am on the verge of killing myself

It all started 3 years ago when my ex girlfriend broke up with me on my sisters wedding and stole my dog (I’m 25 now). Ever since that day my life has been progressively falling into more and more chaos. My dad died 6 months after, and all while getting my degree from a university. I used to be a very happy man, with a huge ambition and big dreams for myself. Right after I graduated high school I decided to sacrifice my social life to pursue my dream of becoming a music producer, and get a degree at the same time. I took time off and did internships out in LA. I am a very passionate person about anything that I love, whether it be a person or a goal. My whole life I have pursued something abstract (professional football player, professional skateboarder, and then to become a famous drummer). I truly believed in my ability to become successful in whatever I chose, and the law of attraction rewarded me with endless opportunities. I worked endless hours on whatever my craft was at the time and I BELIEVED in myself. Eventually I met my now brother in law (after high school) who inspired me to become a music producer because of his success as one. He is my mentor and inspiration for the path that I chose along with my biggest emotional support. He is very connected in the music industry and has a platinum record with Mac Miller. He is well respected in the music industry and is best friends with SuperDuperKyle. If you all don’t know who that is, Kyle recently blew up with his hit “ispy” and became “famous” for it. Kyle and him go way back musically and he even spoke at my sisters wedding. My bro in law let me intern with Kyle multiple times and I developed a sustainable relationship with him. He put me in the same room with so many cool people. Everything seemed like it was working in my favor. I worked my ass off pursuing music doing what I love, had an awesome girlfriend and was getting my degree, but sacrificed the normal life of a college student. I was okay with that because I knew it was the choice I needed to make to become successful in music. I got my degree in marketing and moved out to LA (from Florida) to finally pursue my dream (8 months ago). When my ex broke up with me (3 years ago) under the circumstances above, it completely devastated me because I was so in love with her. We only dated for a year and 2 months, but we had a very strong connection. We planned our whole life out together and she supported me in my music. I never experienced a girl who showed me so much love and care, it was so refreshing. Out of nowhere she broke up with me at my sisters wedding and she was so malicious about it. She was indifferent towards me, she didn’t care about me anymore. She faxed over a picture of her and my dog smiling. She was so mean and hateful. The next three years would be the hardest years of my entire life. I was heartbroken for 2 years and ended up getting put in a mental hospital by my mother. I was put on meds which I vowed to never take and now I am numb to everything. I lost the girl I loved and I lost my beloved father. Through all of that pain I still continued to make music everyday but I slowly was losing my inspiration. Weird right? Usually musicians bank off of pain and suffering, but I just didn’t know how to process those emotions.  Ever since that day I have been falling deeper and deeper into this hole of despair. I started playing a lot of video games and watching a lot of anime. I was choosing to escape my reality vs handle it and be a man. I still moved out to LA after I graduated, but that ambition, motivation, and inspiration had pretty much faded throughout the years. I ended up picking a job up at Starbucks and have been working over 40 hours a week while still making music but not nearly as much. I have been living on my sister and brother in laws couch for the last 8 month off Hollywood to get on my feet while paying rent. Now I have pretty much no interest in making music. I am at my breaking point and I just don’t care anymore. I always told myself “I will never work a normal job because I am not a normal person” and “if I didn’t have music then I would have no motivation to continue living.” Ironically I now have no more interest in music because I am overwhelmed with a debilitating depression that has accumulated over the years. I literally have no idea what my purpose is anymore and it’s the most deflating feeling. I used to be so optimistic and motivated to change this world with beneficial music to society but I have lost my vision and my soul. I barely have interest in breathing. I still love making music and still have that dream but my urge to give up and die has been at an all high. All I keep saying to myself is “I’m tired” “I want to go home” and “I don’t want to live anymore”. I have been making music for 8 years and I gave up everything to pursue it. Now I have no idea what I’m doing anymore and I feel like I have wasted my life away. I am 25 and I have accomplished nothing with my life. I have never released music because I’m too much of a perfectionist.  I missed out on all the good times of college and socializing. I missed out on talking to girls and now I am alone with no one. I haven’t had sex in 3 years and I haven’t had a relationship with a girl in 3 years. I still think about my ex and I can’t even look at her facebook because it hurts too much. I have always worn my heart on my sleeve and I always let myself get hurt by a girl. I quit drinking, smoking weed and smoking cigs all at once to gain a healthier perspective. I am as sober as a door knob and I’m as sharp as a sword but I’m still mentally unstable. Now I have thoughts of wanting to go back home but I have nothing there for me, only the fact that I gave up on my dream. My friends would be so disappointed in me and I would be so disappointed in me. I just want to die but I have religious beliefs and I am afraid to go to hell. Everyday I wake up and the first thing I think about is putting a bullet between my eyebrows. I feel hopeless and I have a good support system but it doesn’t help me. I have a hard time expressing myself verbally and it backfires on me. I don’t understand why good people have terrible things happen and terrible people have great lives. My whole perspective is jacked up and now I’ve become a very bitter person who hasn’t felt true happiness in years. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up but I’m too scared to make that move. I started having night terrors and nightmares. I even had one about a demon that is going to follow me for the rest of my life and I would end up dying by suicide or a brutal death. His name is Iammu (pronounced like Dormammu from Dr. Strange) and it sounds like “I Am You”. I need help from people that can relate to me, not a professional that is paid to give me meds or tell me everything will be okay. I feel like I am embracing the demon into my life

Thank you to anyone that took the time to read this and I’m sorry that it’s such a long rant. I am severely depressed and hopeless but I still have a glimmer of hope inside. That is why I posted this because maybe someone might help me shine again. 

If anyone ever needs someone to talk to I am here for you. I know it sounds like I need the help (which I do) but people like us need to stick together and watch out for each other. People with the biggest hearts usually have the biggest struggles in life. 

Peace and Love,

Hey there, 

I'm a 23 year old grad student. I haven't had much luck with the ladies because of my size (5'3"" 110), so I thought I'd try my luck out here. Made sure to mention this first because I know it turns a lot of girls off. 

Anyway, I'm a super chill, nerdy guy. I spend most of my free time playing video games(PC) watching a lot of TV shows/movies, the usual nerdy stuff. I have watched The Office at least 15 times. I am so really into anime. I absolutely love sitting down and just having serious discussions with people about anything that we watch or play, or any topic really. I am very into my work. I love what I do and I love talking about it. 

I am looking for long term relationship here, but of course that's something we can build up. I am not experienced sexually either (still a virgin), so if you're interested in a sexual relationship as well, you could help me learn, or we could learn together if you're in the same situation as me. But that's also something that can happen down the line if if needed, no need to rush it at all. I am willing to wait for the right time. 

I am super awkward around girls and I never know what to say so please be patient with me haha. 

Bottom line is I want to finally find someone that is ok with a nerdy, small guy like myself and is willing to try for a long term relationship. I'd prefer someone close to my age. I'm down to share pictures once we both are comfortable and think we are a good fit for each other. 

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this. If you think we'd hit it off feel free to Pm me whenever! I'd love to talk more about myself and get to know you better. 

I'll be near Virginia Beach this summer for an internship so if you're in the area and are interested, hmu! 

Looking forward to hearing from you all!"

23 year old virgin here looking for a nice girl to show me the ropes. I'm a grad student and will be near the Virginia Beach area for the summer for an internship. 

I know most girls go for bigger guys, so I wanted make sure you know I am only 5'3"" and 110 lbs. I look very young as a result.

But if you can stand that I think Im a super chill guy and very easy going, if not just a bit awkward. I hope I can find someone willing to teach a smaller, inexperienced guy like me. I kind of have a thing for girls who take the lead as well. 

Considering the subreddit, if this is just a one time thing, I definitely wouldn't mind. But if you are also interested in making it a more regular thing, that would also make me happy (i have some posts in my history about this) 

Anyway I'll keep it short, but if you can help me out, please pm me! Of course you can get to know me a bit better before we meet up!

I just finished my sophomore year of ChE at US university. I was not able to land an internship for this summer. Have been looking for one until now, but it's probably too late to find one. I was wondering if any manufacturing companies hire for a temporary operation position for a few months or this summer? This is probably uncommon since companies usually look for a full\-time worker, but I think having an operation experience at a manufacturing plant could be valid. 

Besides that, what else should I do this summer to advance my resume? Thank you!"

So I’m someone who has dealt with more severe anxiety and OCD/occasional depression for the past several years. During this time, or rather the mentally stronger time in my life, I met my boyfriend who I’ve been with for a year and a half. I love this boy with all my heart, really and truly I do. He is someone I would normally consider the person I could go to if something is troubling me, but things have taken a turn as I have been going through a depressive episode. As I’m starting a new internship (tomorrow actually as I’m typing this), this entire week has been an absolute rollercoaster for my anxiety. The first day I had a panic attack, I called my boyfriend and he had consoled me and reassured me that everything would be okay. However, my anxiety continued to get worse over the past few days and I ended up crying while we were on FaceTime because I was incredibly overwhelmed by not just the internship but because he had made a joke that I was irritated at for some reason. I accused him of not caring about me when I was crying to him even though I couldn’t even tell him exactly why I was crying. He stayed on FaceTime with me in silence mostly, and that night triggered even more anxiety and depression as he said he didn’t know what he had done exactly to make me accuse him of not loving or caring for me. The next day, I felt heartbroken and felt that he for sure did not want to be with me even though we spoke on the phone like normal. I still had a “feeling” that he would break up with me eventually or not care for me anymore because I felt like I was acting differently even though he gave me no indication of that. We saw eachother the day after that and even though everything went perfectly fine and we had a wonderful night, I ended up crying again from thinking about my internship and because he was asleep during this, I ended up getting upset at him and told him he didn’t care even though he was hugging me and trying to be there for me. Throughout all of this, I’ve continued to question my relationship and ask myself “do I even want to be with him?” even though he has done absolutely nothing wrong and has tried to cope with my depressive episode as best he can. I’m beginning to look at very small things about our relationship and having intrusive thoughts of breaking up with him, which devastates me and is making me tear up as I bring it up. I guess my question is for those of you who struggle with anxiety/depression, do stressors trigger these sort of responses towards your partners? And if so, how do you cope with them and maintain some sort of sanity around them? "
8jah77,7,2018-05-14,Healthy food on low budget,MauriceWho,HealthyFood,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/8jah77/healthy_food_on_low_budget/,"Hi everyone,

for an internship, I'll be living in quite an expensive city for a few months.
Usually, healthy food is fairly affordable for me, but due to the high cost of living it now isn't.

At the moment, I try to live of about 5€ of food everyday. The problem is, that most ingredients already cost 3€ a piece.
To actually live with this amount, I look for food that reduces hunger for long and doesn't cost a  lot. This gets even more complicated as I do only have a refrigerator and no kitchen available.
Buying in bulk is not a great option either, as I am the only one eating.

There is occasionally a good deal, such as 125g berries for 1€, but that doesn't quite cut it.

Any ideas or sources for cheap, healthy food that reduces hunger for long?"
8jahmn,2,2018-05-14,I [19m] am in some type of relationship with my friends [19m] ex [19f] after breaking up with my girlfriend [18f],helpmerelation123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8jahmn/i_19m_am_in_some_type_of_relationship_with_my/,"(reposted due to inappropriate language, sorry). This is going to be a long story and I feel the background is necessary to begin this post, if you feel this is too long, I'll bold the point where my problem begins. This all began last year April. My friend and I have been great friends for over 8 years now, we got along amazingly well, probably only had one fight that lasted 3 hours at best and it wasn't even that serious. He started dating his girlfriend around 2015, which is around the same time I started dating my then girlfriend. This was a first time experience for all four of us as we had never dated before. Things went well, I knew my friend's girlfriend well too as she was in many of my classes, and since I was good friends with him I got to know her too.

Probably around the first month of them dating, aka the honeymoon phase, my friend was basically doing everything she told him to do, it was really immature for her to be doing that sort of stuff and him to even comply, but that's beside the point. 

I don't know exactly what came over him after that month, he must have been extremely tired of it all because he drastically changed, he became rude to her. And I mean too-far rude, he would straight up embarrass her in front of other people and laugh it off, she would very clearly walk away mad and he would just keep laughing. At the time I didn't step in because it wasn't my business and I don't know the full story.

Fast forward 2 years where I didn't really talk to my friend's girlfriend much besides some hi or hello and we all went to different colleges. My friend's girlfriend calls me out of the blue and says she needs help and doesn't know who else to ask. She explains how she firmly believes he's been talking to some other girl on the down low and wants me to talk to him about it because she can't. I told her that you're dating him, it's not my place to ask him that, that's yours, I can't simply accuse him of something like that. She constantly keeps pushing for me to talk to him and says that she can't do and pleads to just believe her this once. I gave in.

I spoke with him and asked how his girl was, and how college is going. He didn't mention anything about any other girl. I asked him as a joke if he'd gotten eyes on someone else at college (I used a sarcastic tone), he laughed and said there is one that caught his eye and he talks to her every now and then. I asked if his girlfriend was fine with that, he told me she knows I talk to her, I asked if she was fine with it again, he said I don't know I don't really care. I was very confused, I said if you didn't care, why don't you just break up with her, he says I don't know, too much work, she can leave if she wants to. I sat down and talked with him an hour or so about how it's pretty unfair to her, and I explained how my girlfriend told me she had a crush on some guy but immediately was upfront and talked to me about it and made our relationship stronger. He seemed to agree, and his girlfriend called me to say thanks. 

Fast forward a few more months my girlfriend and I are having a lot of issues. She was constantly mad at me for everything I did, if I brought her a gift, she'd be mad I spent money on her and told me I was an idiot for not saving. When I didn't bring a gift, she'd be mad I didn't get her a gift, it was ridiculous and immature, she expected me to know her exact feelings. She wanted me to talk to her on the phone all the time since we were long distance due to college. I literally spent 8-10 hours a day on skype calls with her, I cancelled family plans, quit gaming, and devoted all my time to her. I got into the routine of constantly trying to keep her happy. At one point I gave up, I just wanted to be myself again, so thats what I did. I gamed some, I went out with friends for a bit, and spent more time with family and still called her for about an hour or two a day. She didn't like it, she was furious, we'd ""broken up"" in the past and got back together after like 2 hours, but this time it was just getting bad. From August 2017 and forward, it was a constant fight.

END OF BACKGROUND

In January of this year I got an internship in a big city, the same city my friend's girlfriend goes to college. We live in the same town so she told me which bus route to take and said she could come with me to show me how the transportation system worked as I was new to it all. I agreed and appreciated her help. I would see her in the morning bus ride and the bus ride back about 3 days a week. One month into these rides, she opened up about her relationship with my friend and just burst into tears telling me she's so miserable and she doesn't know what to do. I asked her what's the problem and she told me all about how my friend hasn't come to see her in 6 months, and how he never really wants to talk to her and that he's always so mad at her. To give her some comfort, I talked about the issues I've been having with my girlfriend too.

Over the course of the next few days, she told me how my friend stopped seeing her because the last time they met at her house, he asked her for a blowjob, but she refused and said that she wasn't ready for that sort of stuff, he apparently pushed her away and told her that he does everything for her and it sucks she doesn't do the same, he then says I'm done with this and storms out swearing that he's not coming to her house again. She told me how he hit her on multiple occasions over things as simple as asking for a drink, and it was hard enough to leave a mark. 

These accusations were insane, I couldn't believe them and I told her that this sounded crazy, if it were true why are you still with him, she kept saying that she still loves him but it just keeps dying and I don't know life without him. I told her I was still skeptical but I told her that if this was true, she needs to watch out for herself. I told her I'd talk to him about this, and she became hysterical, she told me not to say a word about this to anyone, she said she was too afraid of him and what he would do if he found out she told his friend about this stuff. I said fine, but she definitely needed to watch out for herself. A couple days later, she sent me a screenshot where she asked him why he doesn't come see her, to which he responded saying that ""you're a dumbass, I have shit to do fuck off. I'll come see you when I want."". Now this could have definitely been taken out of context, but the anger in the texts was pretty clear, still I told her to watch out for herself. 

Around this time, my girlfriend just went insane about me not giving her enough time cause of my internship, she told me to get out of her life and not contact her so she can get over me, I asked if she was serious, she said yes get the fuck out of my life. I just said fine and left it at that. We went quiet for a day. She came back the next day asking what my issue was, I told her I didn't have any issues, to cut this short as this is long already, I was tired of not being able to live my life and contributing to a relationship that began to feel one sided, I told her we should remain friends and she agreed after a couple hours. 

My friend's girlfriend around that time texted me saying that she couldn't do this anymore, and that she's beginning to get so much stress and axiety she didn't want to live. I told her this is going too far you need to end it. I didn't tell I her I had broken up. She ended up breaking up with him a few days later by simply saying she didn't wanna date anymore and he agreed. 

The next few bus rides were pretty quiet, I eventually told her I had broken up with my girlfriend too and we just stayed quiet after that for a while. After a couple weeks of that, I felt like I was catching feelings for her since I kept wanting to make sure she was fine, I didn't say anything as I said it wouldn't be the right time for this at all, I was still getting over the last one. That all changed when she asked me if I liked her.

I told her it's kind of there, but I'm not entirely sure, I asked her the same and she said she feels the same way. We agreed that we had to supress our feelings and just move on. It stayed that way for a month, we only talked on the bus and never talked about relationships, until another month had passed. I'll admit, I started getting more feelings for her, and it was pretty evident she was getting them from me since she told me more things about herself (nothing more than what you would tell your best friend, but it felt like more for some reason). I did the same and everything was fine up until that point, I still talked to my friend who legitimately did not have any issues with breaking up, seemed like he was very happy in fact, he was constantly posting snapchat stories of him out with other people and putting hearts around other girls. 

Right before spring break, my friend's ex said she wanted to take a picture of me and her for memories before she leaves for break, so he posted a snapchat story of me and her sitting next to each other on the bus, we weren't close enough to even touch each other.

MY PROBLEM

This is where shit went bad, this one fucking snapchat story. My friend absolutely flips. He messages me saying how she's probably into me and moved on already. I said that isn't true at all, we just ride the bus together. He says I know her, I have a feeling she likes you. I had that feeling too, but I didn't say that. He then went on to say that if she was a guy, he would beat the living hell out of her. I said ""dude nothing is going on she just posted the snapchat for spring break"", he said I guess so man. I asked him if he was mad at me, he said no ""why would I be?"" I felt guilty for catching feelings which is why I asked him. My friend's ex messages me saying another one of my mutual (good) friend is constantly messaging her asking if we're dating, she told him no why would we be dating. But he persisted saying that we're friends and that she can tell him. She told him there's nothing going on, you can ask helpmerelation123 if you want. Now my ""good"" friend leaves all the group chats that he's in with me right then.

I asked her what in the world did you say to him, she sent me the entire conversation and it was exactly how she said it was. I was confused, I messaged him asking if everything was already, he was just so mad saying that I'm a liar and hypocrite, I told him to please just tell me what's going on. He said that what kind of friend was I that could pose on snapchats with someone else's girlfriend right after break up, what made me think that I could be with her any point in my life when she mean't something to my friend.

I was so confused, I told him to wait and added my friend to the chat. I explained to him that I've been open about this to him, there isn't anything going on. But my friend #2 would just not believe it, he told me that I shouldn't have been posing, he left the chat. I messaged him apologizing if it seemed unfair for me to do that and that I didn't have any sort of intentions to do that. He left me on read and I haven't spoken to him since.

My friend #1 (original one) switched sides out of no-where and said that friend #2 does bring up a good point. He said that I could have done more to stop her from taking that picture with me, and that by posing in that picture I made it worse. I was so confused and sad and worried and full of anxiety, I said I was sorry I don't understand what's even going on I don't have any wrong intentions. He said it was fine, I asked him to contact friend #2 for me and ask what's wrong. So he did, friend #2 said that he would consider forgiving me and rejoining the chat if I block my friend's ex. Friend #1 said that it should be no problem for me to do if there wasn't anything going on.

Except, I don't want to block her. But I don't want to lose my friends either. She's been crying all the time to me, at times she says please don't leave me like this, at others she begs me to block her so I don't lose my friends because of her. Even though friend #1 said it was ""fine"" and not my fault, he's since been avoiding me, friend #2 hasn't talked to me at all. I feel like i'm ruining relationships for everyone, it literally looks like to everyone that I broke up with my girlfriend and stole my best friends girl with complete disregard for her feelings. I can't tell anyone that I can't block her because I'm her emotional support at this point and honestly I don't want to. But if I don't I just look like a bad guy and I'll lose two of my oldest friends over it. I don't know what to do at this point, I'm trying to keep everyone happy and I'm just ruining myself. Please help.

TL;DR My girlfriend and Ibroke up at the same time my friend's girlfriend and him broke up. Me and friend's ex talked about on same bus commute. She told me her emotional and physical trauma she's had from him. We both caught feelings but didn't act. She posted a snapchat story of her and me sitting next to her on the bus. My friend wants to beat the hell out of her cause of it, my other friend cut off connections with me for posing with my friends girlfriend to apparently piss him off. Friend #1 also thinks that I'm at fault. I want to keep everyone happy, I'm don't want to lose my friendships, but no ones happy cause of me. What do I do, was it really that wrong to take that picture? What do I do next to resolve this?"

First of all, English isn't my mother language, so please I'll try my best.


TL;DR I'm doing an intern (5 months since januari) in New Zealand and found love, friendship and an 'internship job' that I like to do. I'm from the Netherlands and would start a new study of 4 years again when going back, but having heavily second doubts.


So yeah that's it basically. I work (without getting paid) for a company that develops new techniques with the CNC, Laser and 3D printers to make awesome stuff. It's my internship for my last year as a designing furniture maker in The Netherlands. I've been doing this for the past 4 years and really loving to do so.


Since I'm here in New Zealand I've missed my home very much. I have 3 bunny's waiting for me at home together with my dad and sister. My best friend comes to me in 3 weeks to do a road trip here to end my internship period here.

I don't dislike living in The Netherlands, but it has become a very boring living. The only passion I have is making stuff and riding my bike with friends. also a big netflix fan. Always wanted to be more active and I do go on long walks because I love nature (trees - furnituremaker eh)


When I came in New Zealand in Januari I had to adjust alot. Never spoke english on a daily base and well yeah everything is different, but uh zo beautifull! The nature is perfect and the roads with the curves speak to me (and my future bike). ofc thats not all that I love about NZ!


When I met my current boyfriend, everything fell into place. We have our ups and downs, but overall I'm very happy with our relationship. He is really what I always looked for in a guy.


Now my plan is this:
I'm going back to NL in Juli to graduate and get my degree. It's summer holiday there so I have a few weeks to concider my two options. My bf is coming too after a few weeks in August.


1. Stay in the Netherlands. Go to the study interview and get tto study a 4 year course to get my HBO to become a first grade teacher in creativity and arts. This gives me the chance to combine the two things I like to do, Interacting with people and doing my own stuff. 


2. Go back to New Zealand in Februari and do a one year study at weltec Wellingon (already went here and showed my work to the people who decide I can come in or not) they said 'you've got an amazing skillset, we would be happy to have you' It's the post grad study but will kost 20k NZD = 11k euro. untill then (march 2019) I can work at my best friends company in The Netherlands (woodmilling) to get money and work for experiene.

In both cases I will be with my bf, since he's coming to The Netherlands to work here on a working holiday visa from August till max one year. He will be living with me, but I have a spear room if nessesary. He would also want to come back to NZ with me. We talk alot about it lately.

In both cases I could work aswell. There would be more options in NZ, but the study gives me the paper I think is good for my selfesteem to have bachelor of creativity in my name. 
It also gives me some time to find a job (study is 3 days a week and the NL one is 5 days) 


Big choice, luckily still have some time to figure stuff out. I just dont know where to start since there are so many options both countrys have. 

Big lines:

Netherlands : 
+ Family, friends, study for 4 years, my bike, bf, possibility on a job isnt super small..
- boring, super long study(again) maybe missed a chance?


New Zealand:
+ friends, also family (cousin of my dad where I now live), bf, work options that challange me, I go outside alot more, more optimistic and less sick(sea air for forehead infections)
- Scary and alone feeling (still homesick sometimes) not sure if I'm ready for the real grownup lifestyle of work. mostly fear, never lived outside the house before untill this. I'm 21 and moving to the other half of the world, why not eh?

If you have any tips for me that could help me clear up my mind or give me more information why Netherlands or New zealand a good option would be I'm very open for all of those.


Thank you for reading all of this, I'ts just alot for me right now.
My friends in NL say NL, friends in NZ say NZ. It's not really helping so that's why the ask of help to fellow redditors!

8jcd09,0,2018-05-14,[Discussion] I'm conflicted between pursuing Music or Acting and would like to hear some stories/advice/opinions from you all,Rasheediscool,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/8jcd09/discussion_im_conflicted_between_pursuing_music/,"Hey there, so I'll give a little back story.

Sorry if I ramble and make a long post

I'm turning 23 years old and I'm graduating college next month. 2 years back I got an Internship in my field (IT) and got my first taste of the ""real world"". The internship was great, it was fun and I enjoyed it alot. But a part of me realized that I can't sit behind a desk all day.

So originally I picked up Photography. After doing some really intense studying, learning, and practicing over the summer I started putting my work out there. Immediately I was getting positive feedback. People were booking me for events, photoshoots, and even my school hired me to do photos for the graduation.

Throughout the 2 years of doing Photography I've met alot of people in high places both in the music, art, and fashion industry. And each one of them told me that as good as Photography is, majority of them get screwed and lowballed. If I'm looking to make a ton of money it's hard cause most companies don't want to pay photographers much. Which is true, a company like Vogue would pay a photographer 0-500 per picture. That sounds good but in reality there's no job security and there is no consistent money with that.

So I started exploring my other interests and long story short I narrowed it down to acting and music. Both of these things I loved ever since I was a kid. I wanted to take up acting classes when I was 16 but because of financial reasons my mother couldn't afford it. I never had the confidence to do music I had this delusion that they were born with a talent that I didn't have.

**Enough with the back story**

In January I started writing music, I can't sing for shit but I can definitely rap and if I choose to pursue music I'll definitely take vocal classes to develop a singing voice as I'd want to incorporate rap into an R&amp;B style.

If I choose the acting role, I found an acting school in Manhattan called the Barrow Group that I'll choose to attend.

The reason that I can only do one is because I'll still be doing Photography. Photography got me far and I developed a name for myself so I won't give it up. 

I also can't afford to pay for acting classes AND vocal lessons.

And the last reason is because when I commit myself to something I tend to get really obsessed with it and commit most of my time to it. When I started Photography I would practice and watch hours of videos until I got my technique down. When I got my guitar I would lock myself in my room and play for 12 hours and only leave to eat, shit, and shower. So I feel that if I choose either Music or Acting that all my time and effort will he put to that one form of art.

**With all that being said...**

First I'd like to know, what made you do music, why did you pursue this over anything else?

Secondly, why do you think someone should pursue a career in music?

How does the music world treat minorities? I'm an African American male, I know we're sadly still in a world where people like to judge your character based off your race, is there anything I should watch out for?


Thank you

I know I rambled but I just wanted to throw all the details out there so you feel where I'm coming from. Any advice or help is great. Thanks alot!"

They walked me through the creation and startup of a virtual machine. I could hit the connect button, and my laptop would download an .rdp  file to connect to it.

I must have done something unintentionally, because now when I try to start the VM in order to connect to it, it tells me that the VM is 'generalized'. 

It appears that from what I have read that there are ways to copy the machine and recreate it, but I'm lost as to how to do that.

I made a new VM, which I am connecting to without issue, but it is lacking Visual Studio, and some other programs that were available on the initial VM i made.

Any advice on how to access my initial VM?

Thanks.

8jdc64,0,2018-05-14,"My partner(27M) and I(26F) want to get married, but he wants to wait an undetermined amount of time, and I want to do it before a certain amount of time. Is there a compromise?",SoooManyQuestionss,marriageadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/8jdc64/my_partner27m_and_i26f_want_to_get_married_but_he/,"My partner and I have been together for 3 years. He told me from the beginning that he wasn't going to get married until his career was established. I understood that not knowing it would take longer than 3 years. We talk about marriage and kids and our plans for our future, we want to get married, no issues there. 

But he wants to wait until his career is established. It is hard to explain so bear with me as I describe his career situation. He has to find the right opportunity, apply for it, be accepted, do a 4-month internship and then open his own business. He then has a year to make the business successful (there is some form of measurement) and if he does, he will get a contract. He has to have a certain amount of money to start this business venture, he already has what he needs, and then some. He continues to save for it every day. While he is trying to make the business successful, he plans on putting all the money he earns and has, right back into the business to make sure it is successful and that he gets the contract, so I will be the main source of income. He says that if he doesn't get the contract, all this work he has been doing for the past 6-7 years, will have been for nothing. He wants to wait until after he gets his contract, and starts paying himself and gets the bonuses from the contract, to get engaged/married. 

This process, applying, interviewing, interning, starting the business, running it for a year, getting a contract; that is at least a 16 month commitment. 16 is the shortest amount of time it would take, realistically it's like a 2 year period. If he put in an application today, he wouldn't have his contract until I am 28. Based off of what I know about pregnancy in your thirties, my families history of fertility issues (I have an aunt, my mom's cousin, and my great grandma all have had miscarriages, and trouble getting pregnant.  There may even be more cases that I don't know about, also I don't know the women on my dad's side, so there could be more cases there) and where I am at in my life right now, 29 years old is the LATEST that I want to be starting a family. In addition to that, I would really like to be married for a couple years before we start our family. I understand that even though its just a piece of paper, marriage can change things. And I want to learn about that, get comfortable and settled in before we start our family. Even with a short engagement, I would be 29 by the time we are wed (if he started this whole business process today).


He also says he wants to to be able to have the wedding that he wants and give me the wedding that I want (financially). Which makes me think, well, what is that dream wedding? What is the number on that? What if we cant make that happen for another 5 years? I would pay for our wedding myself, I don't care! I just want to be with him, and I want to start a family. It doesn't have to be today, but I also don't want to wait another 2 years before we even begin to be a family just the two of us. Who knows how long it will be before he finds the ""perfect"" or ""right"" situation to apply for. This could take anywhere from 16-46 months. And as I get older, I am really starting to get concerned. I am the pusher in this relationship, I push him outside of his comfort zone, he hates it and makes a huge fuss because he is so stubborn, but every time he does something I push him to do, he is happy he did it. He doesn't take chances, he waits until the stars align, which is ridiculous. You cannot wait for life to happen to you. 

But this isn't something I want to PUSH him into, I think that if he wants to marry me like he says he does, he should do it, not wait until it is financially convenient to him. We aren't hurting for money, we both live very comfortably. By that I mean we do what we want, we don't live paycheck to paycheck, we are responsible with money, we save, we have life insurance and all the good ole adult fun stuff. We have gone to Mexico 3 times in the last 3 years. We could've paid for a wedding with what we spent on those 3 trips. He has a golf membership and golfs all summer long, that's a good chunk of a wedding cost right there!

He is meticulous, he has a plan. I have a loose frame of reference, and they aren't matching up. I understand where he is coming from and I support it, but then he is the only getting what he wants, and I am not. If we get engaged/married before he gets his contract, I am getting my way and he isn't. Our end goal is the same. 

Is there any compromise in this situation?

For those who will say ""he isn't ready"" or ""there is some other reason"", I think the same thing but he swears up and down, he explains and expresses his reasoning and it all comes down to: He wants to commit all his money to his business to ensure that he is successful, and so we can have the wedding and life we want (as money will not be as big of an issue after he gets the contract and bonuses and whatnot). I will also state, I do NOT want children before I am married. Judge that how you will, but that isn't a compromise either of us will make, and I will be doing everything in my power to prevent it.


I just foresee that he won't get his contract for another 3, 4 years. And we will have fertility issues that will destroy me, and I will resent him because he just HAD TO WAIT. Even if we have zero issues with pregnancy, what about what I want? I want to start my family at 29 and be married. He wants to wait an undetermined amount of time. What the hell do people do in these situations?

**Name:** Zelda Aziz, aka, The Scarlet Scorpion

**Age:** 20

**Appearance:** Zelda is a 5'10, black haired, brown skinned, and brown eyed woman. Her costume is mainly consists of blood red, with accents of yellow. Her most distinct feature is, coming from her lower back, a 7 foot long, mechanical, scorpion tail style appendage.

**Mentality:** Zelda is a determined, and focused student, and a persistent researcher. She already is in her final year of schooling, and is mulling going for a doctorate. Her social life is pratically non existent, as she isn't much of a talker. But she is a hell of an observer.

Her biggest internal conflict is coming to terms with herself, and herself post accident. Zelda is worried that, because of her abilities, she may become a lab freak and only be used as a vessel for research. She feels that she has more to offer the world, and there if people work hard enough, they can make the world a better place to live. 

**Background:**

*From selected exerpts of Zelda's daily log.*

October 20th, 2014.

I have decided to restart my journal at a new point, because of extenous circumstances. Nearly month ago, on September 13th, a fatal error in a neighboring lab, in which an energy reactor being tested went nuclear, caused me to be severely injured. I can only remember working on my research onto developing an antivemon for a rare scorpion, then being knocked backwards.

From there, I was in a comatose state. Seven days ago, I woke up. It has been an adjustment, to say the least. But, fortunately, my rehabilitation went extremely well, and I have been released earlier today.

November 5th, 2014.

Something strange happened today. While in the cafeteria, I had a strange feeling, a tingling in my gut. I ducked, and narrowly avoided getting a drink spilled on me. Even odder, I still have this strange, burning sensation through my veins. It isn't painful, just odd. I have decided to go to the lab and run some test. Perhaps the accident might have caused some unintended side effects that the hospital didn't pick up on.

November 6th, 2014.

It is rare that I am absolutely surprised by lab results. Especially my own. But I have reviewed and done checked results all night. And, after seven tests, I have come to several conclusions.

My blood type is unknown. It matches none of the types known to science. Additionally, the chemical composition barely even resembles blood. It actually is closer to a toxin, much like that found in scorpion venom.

There are metallic, unidentified objects in various locations on my body. At first, I speculated this was shrapnel, but it is too perfect to be so. They contour perfectly to the parts of the body they are on. It's almost as if they were placed or molded there. But I can not find any evidence of scaring or how they where placed there.

November 16th, 2014.

I had an idea conserning the irregular composition of my blood. I can not exactly discern how I was able to come to such a radical idea, but I did test it.

I thought careful of the chemical composition of different liquids. The familiar, brief burning sensation returned, but after a period of 15 seconds, it slowly faded away. I then drew another sample of my blood. All three times I tested it, my blood had the composition of every chemical I thought of. Exact same properties and everything. For instance, one of the chemicals I thought of was gasoline. And, not only did it have the exact number of atoms I thought of, it also burned exactly like it should.

For now, I don't know what to think. Either I misread something, or it is likely I have some... ability. Not sure how to properly describe it. Anyways, any further exploration will have to wait, due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

December 2nd, 2014.

Now that I am back on campus and have my bearings again, I am focusing my attention onto the metallic objects that are imbedded into me. I won't have long, considering finals are fast approaching, and I have other, semester long projects looming toward a deadline.

For now, I have discovered six such objects. One on both my left and right forearm. One on both my left and right outer thigh. One on the back of my head, and one on my lower back. The contour to the brief shape of the areas they are located. More interesting, however, is that I am picking up readings of a strong frequency of electromagnitism. Maybe there is a way to interface and explore these... I need to come up with a name for them. Note: let's call them implants, for now.

December 10th, 2014.

For now, two updates. I secured an internship with a technology firm in Chicago, allowing me to stay in the metro area for the holidays, giving me more time to fully experiment and explore.

Secondly, I have finished prototyping a device to interface with the implant on my arm. It is a simple device, only real function is to turn a bulb on and off. Will see it it can securely fit and operate.

December 11th, 2014.

Late at night, so sort entry before I do a proper entry tomorrow. Experiment successful. Device stayed on. However, the light didn't turn on until I thought it should turn in. Testing revealed object did, in fact, respond to my thoughts. This means, somehow, the implants are connected to my nervous system. And explains why taking it off caused a great pain.

Will experiment with a more long term experiment regarding interfacing with this implant.

December 29th, 2014.

I am done prototyping a new device, which I shall call TAIL. The goal is to, essentially, give myself a third, modular limb, grafted onto the back of my spine. My estimate as to completion is a few months before I can have a working prototype.

I am also putting thought into a more long term use for these... irregularities. Perhaps, I can use them for the betterment of society, but I am unsure how. Currently, I am the only one that has all the pieces as to my abilities. But for now, I am focusing my energies into creating project TAIL.

March 3rd, 2015

I have done it. I have a mostly compete version of TAIL. It is ready for a connection test. However, if this is successful, I think that, for the most part, it is permanent. For if the smaller scale, test object was painful to remove, undoubtedly, TAIL will hurt even more, to the point of being unbearable. But I shall push on. For progress.

March 4th, 2015

The TAIL is functional. It is taking some getting used to, but currently, I can successfully utalize the grabbing function to grab a glass without spilling. So far, I haven't been outside today, as I'm afraid of reception. But I think it's time to test the other functions of the TAIL.

Later in March 4th.

Successful test of both hiding functionality and compressed air cannon. Will prototype a costume, for a street test.

**Reputation:** She's still a relatively new hero, only having started less than a year ago. As a result, she doesn't know anyone else in the super community, although she might identify a costume or two. There is a lot of mystery surrounding the sudden apperance of the Scarlet Scorpion, and for the most part, she doesn't do anything to answer for herself. As a hero, she isn't the most public of heroes, not even taking care to introduce herself or her cape name.

**Resources:** She has a workshop, based out of her apartment, where she prototypes and makes adjustments to her various equipment and costuming.

---

###POWERS AND SKILLS

**Power Descriptions:**

* Power One: Neural augments Focus: (Self)

Her body has grown mysterious, metallic augments into her flesh and bone. As a result, she can attach custom made equipment to her body, and it connects to her nervous system, allowing her to control it with a thought.

* Power Two: Blood Chemistry Focus: (self/generation)

Zelda has the power to manipulate the chemical component of her own blood without any negative side effects to herself. Additional, she produces new blood at an increased rate.

* Power Three: Scorpion Sense

Zelda can feel, in general, objects around her in a twenty foot radius that have the potential to harm/ injure her or others.

**Power Versatility:** Her most versitile power is her Blood Chemistry, since as long as she knows the exact chemical components of any liquid, then she can recreate it in her own blood. Her Neural Augments only serve as a connecting point to other technology that she invents/makes.

**Power Drawbacks:** anything connected to her through her neural network is connected to her as if it were a limb, meaning she feels pain if it's damaged or destroyed. She can't receive blood from other people, meaning blood loss is a problem for her. 

**Skills:**

* Skill One: Biochemistry

* Skill Two: Mechanical Engineering

* Specialisation: Tinker/Marksman

**Equipment/Weaponry:** (Focus: Self)

 * T.A.I.L (Tactical Augment for Injection Launch). A large, 7 foot long augment that rests at the back of her back. It  has several different functions. It can function as an arm, fold down into a smaller size to that Zelda can walk around in public,  and can be used as a launcher that fires special darts. The dart types are below.

  * Sleeping: these darts neutralize a target, causing them to fall into a deep sleep.

  * Calming: fires a dart with a chemical that causes those hit to calm down.

 * Laughing: this dart has a chemical that causes the one affected by it to laugh uncontrollably.

 * C.L.A.W. (Contained Luxury Augment Widget) A heavy glove designed around her hand. It allows her access to several, small, utility focused functions. It has a lock pick, a USB for interfacing with computers, a emergency pepper spray for last ditch situations, and a machete.

 * Her costume. She has bought some bullet-proof material, mainly around the chest area, that she has weaved into it.

###ATTRIBUTES/FEATS

**Strength:** Peak human 

**Agility:** Her scorpion sense allows her to be knowledgeable about incoming treats/attacks. However, she still has peak human speed, meaning she probably can't dodge everything.


**Intelligence/Wisdom:** 175 IQ. Very knowledgeable about science, with a focus on biochemistry and engineering.


**Defense:** The area of her costume covering her chest is bulletproof.


**Offense:** Non lethal darts, fired at Mach 1. Require skin contact to work.

**[OPTIONAL] Approval Notes:**

Aim to be a 4, maybe a 5 on the power scale."

I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa you can choose a different name, if you prefer).... I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are.

Ideally this would go on for a bit. I like buildup.

Ideally I’d find a partner who wants to chat and role play beyond this scenario assuming there’s some chemistry.

Sometimes I have a lot of time, sometimes I can only write once a day. "
8jdqd0,41,2018-05-14,Me [22M] with my Girlfriend [21F] together for 5 Years; Don't know whether or not to propose,ConfidentConfusion2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8jdqd0/me_22m_with_my_girlfriend_21f_together_for_5/,"Backstory.
Met when I was a senior in high school and she was a sophomore. Dated the whole year and summer until at the end of summer when I left the country and went to college (in our town) where we broke up within a month. We got back together the next summer when she was going into her senior year. Things were, of course, rocky at first (trust issues from the breakup), but we have been together for 4 straight years, and have lived together for 3.

We are rock solid now, current and future plans align nearly 100% as far as importance on career, family, friends, as well as views on politics, religion, handling finances, future living situations, etc.. We have talked about marriage extensively and I have even bought a ring (she knows that I was searching for rings, does not know that I have purchased one).

Situation.
I am planning to propose in about 2 weeks, the day before we go on a 2 week vacation (to her favorite place in the world) with her family. They are all very supportive of us getting married, and she would love to show off her ring to them during the trip, hence the plan to do it then.

However. She, just last week, got accepted to an internship that will take her across the country for the entire summer (leaves the day after we land back in town), and when she gets back I will be starting law school (in our town). I am wondering if this is still the right time to propose. 

It would be a long engagement either way due to the financial constraints of law school, but I just don't know if its right to profess this great love to her and the world right before she leaves for 2 1/2 months and gets back just in time for me to get locked in a library for a semester.

It might just be nerves, but I am starting to wonder if I should wait until she at least gets back from her internship to pop the question.


TLDR: Marrying high school sweetheart, wondering if I should propose before she moves across the country for the summer (so a piece of me will be with her) or wait until she gets back."

Maybe I'd say a few words to you every now and then, have a pleasant conversation, maybe even get a picture at the end, but I mostly did it to help out the potential of working in movies later on in life.

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

Hey! I'm Matthew, 21 years old and I'm looking for a girl to play as a celeb on this big movie premier. Ideally the two of us flirt for a little bit before sneaking off for some alone time. This can be as vanilla or as kinky as you desire, either way is perfectly fine with me.

Favorite Celebs: Emma Watson, Emma Roberts, Scarlett Johannson, Ariana Grande, Victoria Justice, Jennifer Lawrence, Alexa Bliss, Becky Lynch, Dakota Kai, Nadine Velasquez

I hope to hear back from some of y'all, and if you want to play one of my previous prompts I'm always open to those as well!"

I am an adult lookin for adults for a story that is purely fantasy. 
   

I am going to try to set the scene first, if you just want to see the idea for the prompt skip to the end. 
  

A couple moved in next door to me a few weeks ago. I’m staying in my parents friends house, they decided to move overseas for a sabbatical year, and had generously offered me their home, on condition I looked after it. They were both professors at the college I was going to, do it worked out. They got someone to watch the house, and I got to live privately right off campus.  

Back to the couple. He looked to be around 55. A handsome gentleman, looked like he worked in banking, power suit and a silver head of hair. She, on the other hand, looked to be around 40. [Blonde, with a perfect hourglass figure](https://i.redd.it/inp78euigbcz.jpg), she was the type of woman any young man would give their left hand to have as a neighbor. I say left hand, because they would want the right hand if you know what I mean. 


I didn’t have much to do with them the first week, beyond going over to welcome them and introduce myself. The husband seemed nice enough, if not a little preoccupied, and the wife was very bubbly and sweet. I did notice that she was in fantastic shape for her age, but I did catch a glimpse of a private gym in the house so that accounted for her body. 

I left them my number with the offer to call if they needed anything, and I didn’t hear from them for two weeks. One morning, on a Sunday, she called me up to ask me to help set up her wifi. She explained that her husband was at work, being a workaholic, and I was happy to help. That was when I first realized she was a bit dim. The only problem with the WiFi was it was unplugged, but she didn’t seem to understand that. She also had me fix a faucet, which was only not working because she was trying to turn the knob the wrong way. 


Oh, and did I mention [what she was wearing when I got there?](https://i.imgur.com/QITRGrV.jpg). I was happy to help, and quickly did what she needed, before chatting for a few minutes. I didn’t really pay attention, [for obvious reasons](https://i.redd.it/m8m86q5gpfw01.png). But as she droned on, and I eagerly watched and waited for her tits to slip out, I did hear a bit. She mentioned how her husband didn’t let her go to his office anymore, because she would always end up talking to the interns, and once she even let them slap her ass, but just to prove it was real. She explained how at first her husband was upset, but he wasn’t angry after she told him she did it to prove to the interns that their boss had a real wife, not a plastic one. 



After we finished chatting, I went back home, but my mind was filled with ideas. 

**end of scene**


So, if it’s not abundantly clear from the setting, I’m looking for a woman who wants to play a bimbo. Not a cock hungry whore, but rather a really sweet, innocent, and gullible woman. I’ll be the young neighbor who slowly starts to take advantage of her, first in small ways, like convincing her to model her bikinis for me, or even lingerie. But we’ll slowly take it further and further, maybe even involving her husband. Perhaps they are trying to conceive, and I explain that I know the best position to impregnate a woman, but I have to demonstrate it on her. 

I think you get it. My kinks are bimbos, big tits, outfits, naive women, oily sex, public sex, exhibition, anal, eating pussy/ass, cheating, cuckolding, and much much more. I can’t wait for some envelopes.

8jdx5o,0,2018-05-14,"My partner [M/27] and I [F/26] want to get married, but he wants to wait until he reaches a career goal and my clock is ticking.",SoooManyQuestionss,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8jdx5o/my_partner_m27_and_i_f26_want_to_get_married_but/,"**My partner and I have been together for 3 years. He told me from the beginning that he wasn't going to get married until his career was established.** I understood that not knowing it would take longer than 3 years. We talk about marriage and kids and our plans for our future, we want to get married, no issues there.

But he wants to wait until his career is established. It is hard to explain so bear with me as I describe his career situation. He has to find the right opportunity, apply for it, be accepted, do a 4\-month internship and then open his own business. He then has a year to make the business successful \(there is some form of measurement\) and if he does, he will get a contract. He has to have a certain amount of money to start this business venture, he already has what he needs, and then some. He continues to save for it every day. While he is trying to make the business successful, he plans on putting all the money he earns and has, right back into the business to make sure it is successful and that he gets the contract, so I will be the main source of income. **He says that if he doesn't get the contract, all this work he has been doing for the past 6\-7 years, will have been for nothing. He wants to wait until after he gets his contract, and starts paying himself and gets the bonuses from the contract, to get engaged/married.**

**This process, applying, interviewing, interning, starting the business, running it for a year, getting a contract; that is at least a 16 month commitment.** **16 is the shortest amount of time it would take, realistically it's like a 2 year period. If he put in an application today, he wouldn't have his contract until I am 28.** Based off of what I know about pregnancy in your thirties, my families history of fertility issues \(I have an aunt, my mom's cousin, and my great grandma all have had miscarriages, and trouble getting pregnant. There may even be more cases that I don't know about, also I don't know the women on my dad's side, so there could be more cases there\) **and where I am at in my life right now, 29 years old is the LATEST that I want to be starting a family.** In addition to that, I would really like to be married for a couple years before we start our family. I understand that even though its just a piece of paper, marriage can change things. And I want to learn about that, get comfortable and settled in before we start our family. Even with a short engagement, I would be 29 by the time we are wed \(if he started this whole business process today\).

He also says he wants to to be able to have the wedding that he wants and give me the wedding that I want \(financially\). Which makes me think, well, what is that dream wedding? What is the number on that? What if we cant make that happen for another 5 years? I would pay for our wedding myself, I don't care! I just want to be with him, and I want to start a family. It doesn't have to be today, but I also don't want to wait another 2 years before we even begin to be a family just the two of us. Who knows how long it will be before he finds the ""perfect"" or ""right"" situation to apply for. This could take anywhere from 16\-46 months. And as I get older, I am really starting to get concerned. **I am the pusher in this relationship, I push him outside of his comfort zone, he hates it and makes a huge fuss because he is so stubborn, but every time he does something I push him to do, he is happy he did it. He doesn't take chances, he waits until the stars align, which is ridiculous. You cannot wait for life to happen to you.**

But this isn't something I want to PUSH him into, I think that if he wants to marry me like he says he does, he should do it, not wait until it is financially convenient to him. We aren't hurting for money, we both live very comfortably. By that I mean we do what we want, we don't live paycheck to paycheck, we are responsible with money, we save, we have life insurance and all the good ole adult fun stuff. We have gone to Mexico 3 times in the last 3 years. We could've paid for a wedding with what we spent on those 3 trips. He has a golf membership and golfs all summer long, that's a good chunk of a wedding cost right there!

**He is meticulous, he has a plan. I have a loose frame of reference, and they aren't matching up. I understand where he is coming from and I support it, but then he is the only getting what he wants, and I am not. If we get engaged/married before he gets his contract, I am getting my way and he isn't. Our end goal is the same.**

**Is there any compromise in this situation?**

For those who will say ""he isn't ready"" or ""there is some other reason"", I think the same thing but he swears up and down, he explains and expresses his reasoning and it all comes down to: He wants to commit all his money to his business to ensure that he is successful, and so we can have the wedding and life we want \(as money will not be as big of an issue after he gets the contract and bonuses and whatnot\). I will also state, I do NOT want children before I am married. Judge that how you will, but that isn't a compromise either of us will make, and I will be doing everything in my power to prevent it.

I just foresee that he won't get his contract for another 3, 4 years. And we will have fertility issues that will destroy me, and I will resent him because he just HAD TO WAIT. Even if we have zero issues with pregnancy, what about what I want? 

**\-\-\-\-\-\-\-**

**TLDR**

**My partner and I want to get married. I want to get married, and start a family by 29. He wants to wait \(an undetermined amount of time\) until he reaches a career goal. What the hell do people do in these situations?**

**Thoughts? Comments? Suggestions? Your experience? Am I wrong?**"

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

8jesmn,20,2018-05-14,I [19F] am having a hard time getting over the fact that my mom [41F] just now told me she is pregnant even though she's almost 7 months along.,Discombobulated_Sort,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8jesmn/i_19f_am_having_a_hard_time_getting_over_the_fact/,"I'm extremely happy for her and thrilled over adding another member to our family (especially a sibling!), but I would be lying if I said I wasn't deeply hurt and angry that she shut me out for so long and also lied to me about her pregnancy, too. 

Part of the reason why this is so confusing for me is because we've always been so close (or at least I thought we were) - at least closer than almost all of my friends and their mothers. I won't say that we share every secret with each other, but there isn't a ton of information we withhold, particularly with big events. 

I just can't understand how she could know about this pregnancy for so long and not tell me at any point. I can understand if she didn't want to tell me while I was home over winter break since she hadn't reached 12 weeks yet. I can even understand if she wanted to wait until she could tell me in person, but I can't understand not asking me to drive home (only 6 hours away) or finding some way that she could tell me sooner rather than wait several months until I came home for summer. Even if she didn't want either of us to drive, we could have had a video conference. I would even have preferred being told over text rather than coming home and finding out by seeing her in person. To say it was a shock would be an understatement. 

The other part of this that bothers me is that she also lied to me. One of my friends that still lives in my hometown told me a couple months ago that she saw my mom and would almost guarantee she was pregnant. She was so convinced (originally she asked me why I didn't tell her that my mom was pregnant) that I did end up asking my mom, and she flat out told me that she wasn't pregnant and I believed her because I didn't think she'd lie to me about something like this. I guess she has a right not to tell me, but it still hurts that she not only didn't tell me but also lied to avoid having to tell me.

She says that she wanted to tell me in the right way but never found the right opportunity, but I find that so hard to believe. I want to find some explanation, but I just can't think of any that makes sense. 

I have tried over the last week (since I found out) not to let this bother me or affect my view of my mom, but that isn't going well for the reasons listed above. It also doesn't help that now I'm realizing how many people other than me know. My mom has said that my grandparents know as well as my stepfather's family, but I'd guess that most of her friends and co-workers also have to know by this point so probably I'm one of the few people close to her that didn't know. 

It would also have been nice to know so I could have been involved. Obviously with the distance between her home and my school I wouldn't have been that involved, but I would have liked to know how the baby was doing and follow his progress.  

The more I think about the situation the more I feel like maybe my mom and I aren't as close as I thought or maybe there is some issue in our relationship that I'm not aware of. I'm really not sure what to think, but I've been considering going to stay with my uncle this summer because I don't feel like I can be around her right now or that it will be good for our relationship given how hurt I am.  And to be honest I feel like I've been made an outsider anyway. If she doesn't think I am important enough to share this kind of news with, then I'd rather not be around her.  

Is there any reason to explain why she didn't tell me?

Am I wrong to be upset by her not telling me and also lying to me and think this as a big of a deal as it seems to me?

Would it be an overreaction to go stay with my uncle for the summer instead of staying with my mom? I don't want to strain our relationship even more, but at the same time I have no desire to be around her right now and I'm afraid I may not deal with my feelings well if I stay around. I do have an internship here, but I could probably get out of it since it is with a family friend and do similar work for my uncle.  


tl;dr: I found out my mom is pregnant last week even though she's almost 7 months along. I am hurt and upset by this but am wondering if I could be overreacting in any way. Also considering whether I should move out of her house for the summer to give myself some space or if that would be worse. "

i don't like studying. Or rather i try to ook for excuses to not do things i'm not interested in. At  least, i used to. now i just go ""oh i have this assignment i don't care for. i'm not gonna do it today either, huh? well shit."" i have some friends helping me power through it but i'm doubting wanting to finish school.  
  
the first 2 years were awesome, all the knowledge i could want and i was motivated but as subjects changed, i lost interest. Since the start i always wanted to be a solo game developer (which is nice because my branch at school focuses on game development) but as one, i'm my own boss. meaning i can't be hired or fired, eliminating the need for a degree. If i fail, however, i won't have a degree to fall back on. i *would* have my previous work to show off my abilities though. I just think a lac kof a degree would hurt my chances a lot if my original goal failed.  
  
Having said that,  i don't regret going to school because i don't think i could be confident in myself if i hadn't learned what i know now. The things i need to force myself to do now involve android development, scrum and connecting mobile phones to servers. i don't care about that at all.  
  
  
  
it seems my choices basically boil down to me making a decision between powering through or just quitting and doing what i want to do, i can't seem to compare the pros and cons though, and it feels like it's slowly driving me into depression.  
  
  
even this post was actually more of a way to vent than a cry for help. I've thought to talk to the school's psyhiatrist about this but i'm not doing it. It's not as strong of a feeling as ""i don't want to"" but it defnitely is in the same direction."

8jfflp,3,2018-05-14,"I [19F] think I want to break up with my boyfriend [20M]. The problem is, we’re moving into a new apartment next week. What should I do?",broodyhen,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8jfflp/i_19f_think_i_want_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend/,"Hi all! I’m sorry, this post is long as I’m writing out all of my thoughts, but any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

So I have been with my boyfriend since freshman year of high school. We’ve just completed our second year of college (so we’ve been together nearly 6 years). When we first came to college, I did have a few doubts about staying with him through college. But I mostly just shrugged it off because I was, for the most part, happy with him. However, over the past couple weeks, I’ve put some real thought into it. I’ve come to the conclusion that I think it would be best not only for me, but for him as well, to separate, for a variety of reasons. 

For starters, I don’t really have many friends. The only friends I really have at college are my boyfriends friends. And if we break up, those friends would definitely stick with him. I feel like part of the reason I don’t have many friends can be attributed to our relationship because I mostly just want to come home to him every night (I’m really shy and struggle in making friends). I feel like if we were to split, I would really be forced to meet other other people and I feel that’s what I need. I also believe that comfort with him has also prevented me from doing extra-curricular activities, such as joining university clubs or starting volunteer work and applying to internships, because all I want to do is come home to hang out with him. It’s not directly his fault, but rather my attachment to him. I’ve tried to branch out and try new things, but I always find myself stopping because I would rather spend time with him. 

I feel that he is also in the same boat. He’s become friends with people, but never really hangs out with them. He’s also thought about interning but never put in the effort to. Granted, there may be other things that stopped him, but I feel like our relationship has definitely influenced it. I just think we’re super attached to other, which can be nice, but I think it’s become unhealthy as it’s influenced other important things in our lives. 

I also feel that at this point of my life, I really shouldn’t be in this “bubble” that I’m in. I feel like now is the time to try new things, explore and try to find myself. I think as long as I’m in this relationship, I won’t ever have the guts to do that. 

Over the last year, I’ve also become less attracted to him, not just over looks but to his personality as well. A lot of times I really have to force myself to laugh at his jokes and initiate conversation. He’s also a lot less mature than I am, which can be fun, but a lot of times it just gets on my nerves (just things like farting or pushing my buttons because he thinks it’s funny). It just sucks because he absolutely deserves someone who finds him funny and attractive, but lately I just haven’t. I also really have to force myself to be intimate with him, and not being intimate really takes a hit on his self-esteem (understandably). I just don’t want him to feel like he has to change for me, no one should have to do that, but I also don’t want him to feel like he’s not good enough. I think someone else could make him a lot happier than I could, and vice-versa. 

I think I just realized I might want different things from an SO, but I won’t ever know unless we break up and see other people. I truly believe he should also experience life and see other people as well. On the other hand, this could be the best relationship I’ll ever have and I’ll just be throwing it away. He treats me so well, and I really do love him, despite the annoyances. I feel so guilty for feeling this way. I would be losing not just my boyfriend, but my best friend. So I’m pretty torn. Other people have said that I’m probably not missing out on much by being in a committed relationship, but I don’t know. I almost feel like I would rather have more “oh wells” than “what ifs.”

But next lies the problem of what to do if I do break up. We’re moving into a new apartment next week with another roommate. I haven’t signed the lease yet, and shouldn’t have to for about another week. But if I do breakup, I’m not sure what will happen. I’m not sure if we would be able to live together while being broken up, but I also don’t want to fuck him and my other roommate over by making them pay more for bills than they planned to. I’m also not really sure where I’d go if living together after the break up wouldn’t work out (which I realize probably won’t). We’ll both be working full time over the summer so we may not be seeing each other much anyways. 

So I guess my main questions are:
Has anybody else gone through a situation like this? Do you think I should break up or maybe try to work things out? If I choose to break up with him, how do I go about it? Any advice on what to do with the living situation if we were to split up?

TLDR; Torn about breaking up with SO to experience life, as I think it would do us both good, but there would be a lot of heartache on both sides. If we do break up, I’m not sure how it would work out as we’re supposed to move into a new place next week. Pls help.

So I thought if I plan for a college course in the meantime related to my career interests it will eventually help lead me to better job opportunities after some time once I've gained the skills for it. 

Now this is the problem that comes in, I might have an internship or freelance opportunity with a company that has some focus on the skills I'd like to have but they want me to attend their event on the same day that I have to register for the college courses. 

I don't want to lose either opportunity because I originally had plans to do both at the same time, which is actually possible since I planned for it ahead of time. But in this case the employer that I'm talking to wishes that I come to the event, and reschedule the registration with the college I want to attend for my classes. I contacted the college and they told me only way to get the course was to attend their session in person. 

I feel stuck because while I feel excited about at least getting an internship, I don't know if the job given to me will be in the field I'd like it to be in. Also, I'm worried if I don't apply for the college I want to go to then I might not be able to get the other possible job opportunities that might occur once I finish learning my skills.

NOTE: I am working on changing my career, and I don't want to make another mistake in working for a career that I don't have strong interests in. My other fear is getting the course skills I need for a job, but still not getting the job opportunity that I'm looking for (study but somehow still not get a job). 

I'm interested in the tech field, but some people think I might be for a field outside of that(I sense a stereotype lol, and I don't want to apply to it based on others opinion).

I would like to do the internship that is a possiblity if I agree to work for the employer, I just don't like feeling pressured in choosing one over the other because I never had that intention at all. I'm definetely going to tell the employer the information I found on the course and hopefully resolve something between us but I'm not sure since it feels like pressuring into a yes or no opportunity with no ""ok maybe we can do some schedule adjustments inbetween to have it work out for all of us"". It feels like I have to be on demand for everyone else, and I'm not that comfortable with it. 

I know I wrote a lot, but I had to get it off my chest because I don't know who else to talk to about this.  Any solutions would help if there are any?  "

Dad renewed it this morning \(even though both websites were on auto renewal it had expired for some reason?\) and it still reads as ""Expired""

Should I wait to see if the support ticket gets answered? I elaborated a bit further and provided pictures of the issue.

8jh2p7,12,2018-05-14,Need some advice about whether I should transfer.,feenotsosimple,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/8jh2p7/need_some_advice_about_whether_i_should_transfer/,"Just completed 1L at Rutgers and was wondering whether a transfer to Fordham would be sensible for career prospects. Currently have more than a 3.4 @ Rutgers; also on a scholarship through which I'll graduate debt free. 

Although I like Rutgers, I enrolled into the school due to the generous scholarship, conversations with 2Ls and 3Ls at the school about the quality of work they're finding, and my desire to work in the NJ legal market (I wanted to move out of NY while still remaining close to it). The school is fantastic, especially the faculty. I haven't had trouble finding internships or opportunities to network. 

However, as I move into 2L and look forward to OCI/post graduate prospects, I'm finding the LST report for the school extremely vague. Around 28% of students find work in large or small firms, federal clerkships, or public service collectively. Knowing the NJ legal market, I'm assuming everyone else clerks at state level clerkships. What happens to these students after these clerkships end is what I'm concerned with. Yes, I know, I should have known going in, but like all else, I learned through the course of the semester about clerkships, OCI, applying to firms, etc.

This uncertainty has led me to believe a transfer to Fordham (as I'm sure my grades are not enough for NYU/CLS) is in order. However, Fordham does not allow transfers to participate in the early interview week (can't remember the exact name). I don't want big law anyway, if that means anything.

Of course, I'll lose my scholarship at Rutgers and will have to take out about 60K in loans if I decide to attend Fordham (that's calculated with the amount of support I will be receiving from my parents). Essentially, what's driving my decision to transfer is post graduate career prospects. 

What do you guys think?"
8jh4gc,12,2018-05-14,I'm stuck in a rut. I hate every aspect of my life and I can't seem to improve one while the rest stays awful.,MGsubbie,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/8jh4gc/im_stuck_in_a_rut_i_hate_every_aspect_of_my_life/,"(Not everything I wrote is in chronicle order.)

Since I've been 13 (I'm 31 now), I've known maybe 2.5 happy years. 

My best friend from childhood and I grew apart. I had a few friends, but I had the impression it was more that they tolerated me than they liked me. I got bullied, every year it got worse. I got bad grades in school, got in constant trouble with teachers despite the fact that really the worst that I did was not being great at following the class or doing homework on time. I never disrupted anything. The teachers sometimes got mad at me for asking legitimate questions. I had a teacher who loved taking every chance he got at putting the students down, I was his most common victim.

I did make a very close friend at 15 while I was at an international summer camp, he was from a different country though. I was able to see him from time to time, but most of our contact was online. His friendship really helped me cope with everything else that was going wrong. The last time I saw him was when I was the year before I went to college. I also got a few girlfriends in my late teens, but never anything serious and most of them were the ones to break up with me. 

Over time I heard less and less from him. Until finally he just stopped replying to my emails altogether, after months of me being the one the initiate every conversation. But I made a new best friend in college. We would live in the same building in my second year, but he dropped out and ghosted me. So I made a new best friend. And he ghosted me. So I made a new best friend. And he ghosted me. So I made a new best friend. He ended up taking advantage of me, using me as free housing and stealing some of my stuff. He did at some point give me a few hundred euros as rent, but it was nothing compared to all the extra money I spent on food, drinks, etc. Luckily, I was finally able to cut him out of my life completely.

My mom left my dad after he had an affair and went to live with another man, I went to live with her. And he was an absolute piece of shit. He treated me horribly. He was constantly insulting me, putting me down, sometimes threatening me with violence. To be fair, there were some things I had to change, but the way he went at it was horrible. And my mom, she just let it happen. Coming up with excuses for him. ""Oh, he had too much too drink tonight."" ""But he treats me so well!"" Yeah nice mom, that's exactly what battered women say. (To be clear, I don't think he ever physically hurt my mom, but he had his verbally abusive moments towards her too from time to time.)

Two of the mentioned happy years were in college though. Finally I was no longer being bullied, and there was a group of people where I felt accepted. I finally had the social life I always wanted in high school. I spent so much time on that social life that I completely failed college. I dropped out after my second year and started looking for a job. I couldn't find one in the town I lived, so I moved back in with my mother and stepdad. I got a job where I did well, but I couldn't stand to live in that household a second longer. So I moved out and went back to my previous town. (Where I went to college.) 

The relationship with my mom deteriorated even further. At some point I cut her off for a few months, because it was almost only criticism and negativity from her end, it made me feel exhausted and stressed out. She tracked me down and we had a conversation. It came down to ""You're making it sound like it's all my fault."" YES MOM, IT IS (was) YOUR FAULT. Things got a bit better, but it still didn't seem to register with her that I felt completely abandoned by her, that things needed to change on her end. The one thing at that point that she did positively was push me to get tested.

I got diagnosed with autism at 25. Suddenly my entire past started to make sense.

When I was in between jobs, I met a girl online. It wasn't a dating site or anything like that, but she sent me a private message, I replied, and at some point we got to talking on a daily basis. Our routine was get up, go online and immediately start talking. We took breaks to do errands, make food, etc. But we voice chatted on a daily basis. We did some NSFW stuff over webcam. We watched movies together, play some flash games together. I was able to be honest to her about everything. Talk about my emotions, mention my dreams and goals, bring up what I was ashamed of, everything. She gave me compliments and made me feel better about myself. I was always smiling because of her. She didn't live that far off, but there was a sea between us. We were both on a low income and never got to travel to each other. It might sound stupid, but she's the only girl I've ever loved. The closest thing I've gotten to a relationship was just online, how pathetic is that? After several months, she had to move away to basically the other side of the world, back to her home country. She was there on a student visa and couldn't obtain a work visa. I told her I was terrified of being ghosted again.

We talked for a few months more, but she treated me more differently with each passing day, to the point that it was like we were just platonic friends, that nothing ever happened. I wrote an email describing my feelings, how I couldn't continue like that. And that's when she ghosted me.

So basically it felt like every person I ever cared about abandoned me, and since then I feel unlovable. 

Now let's talk about jobs. I've been going from job to job, never being able to hold one down. The longest I've worked at the same place is probably about 7 months. I had one job that I actually liked. I'm massively into video games, and also into movies and TV-shows. I got a job at the entertainment section of a large chain, and was put in charge of the gaming section. So far all my jobs I just had to follow directions, but this one I was supposed to take more initiative. I didn't fulfill their expectations, and so I lost the only job I liked. This was around the time where she started ghosting me.

The two best things that happened to me, the two things that finally made me feel like my life was heading somewhere, were gone. 

I got another full-time job after that, but once again they found I couldn't work independently, so I lost that job. Literally the day after my last day there, my mom died from cancer. And I never got to resolve my issues with her.

Three years ago, I started a special program to help me find a job and help me find an employer who could work with my autism-related issues. I started an internship that would help me fill up my resume a bit and get me readjusted to working. And on the first day, I just broke down. The years of misery caught up with me. I started crying constantly. After 2 days I had to quit and I got diagnosed with depression. I went to a psychological rehab center and got some help. I got some therapy elsewhere too, but it didn't work. But slowly I felt better and better.

Then I found an employer who exclusively hires people with autism and I applied. It went pretty well, and 2 weeks ago I started what's called an assessment period. And on the first day, I broke down again. All that progress I made over the past 3 years gone.Constant crying and feeling really down. I'm biting through, but I'm so stressed out. Stressed that I'm not ready and will continue to keep crying. And the stress itself only makes me more likely to do so.

Due to my lack of a steady job, it's very hard to find someone who will rent out a place to me. I still live in housing that's actually meant for students. My studio apartment certainly isn't bad, but the walls are pretty thin and my room is at the end of the hallway downstairs, so there is a lot of noise and I can't sleep properly, which only adds to my stress.

If I work full-time again, I'll only feel that I'm just another number in the machine, just there to help the economy out. I've always seen a job as what I have so I can have a life... But I don't have a life, so what's the point? I'd spend over 40 hours a week working + commuting so I can come home and wallow in my misery.

I'm also afraid that with that amount of time spent on work, I'll be too exhausted to try to expand my social life. Going out to get to meet women, making new friends, it's going to be even more difficult. 

I do have my sister in my life, my niece/goddaughter, and I have one friend I can call close. But my friend is originally from another country and might go back there permanently. He also stays there weeks at a time every year. My sister is going to move to her husband's country in a few years, so I won't see her or my niece a lot. So I might end up all alone again. 

 But I haven't been in a relationship for years. I've been wanting affection for such a long time, just some physical contact. And sure, sex would be nice too. But just someone who puts her head on my shoulders, who would stroke my arm and tell me everything will be okay. I wanted to be married by 30, have kids by 35. I wanted a job that I'm passionate about. A good social life. A nice home.

And I have none of these things. I've been fighting for years, every year thinking ""this will be the year where things will finally get better"", yet that year never came. I'm just tired of it. I'm stuck in this rut. Every other part of my life sucking makes it very hard for me to improve just the one. I can't do a full-time job without a social life, I can't lead a full social life without a job, finding a serious, long-term relationship will be more difficult without financial stability. 

I'm just stuck and I don't know what to do."
8jhwbx,11,2018-05-14,And I'm the unreasonable one...,WickedSpite,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/8jhwbx/and_im_the_unreasonable_one/,"I decided I didn't want to renew our year\-long lease, and decided to move in together with my boyfriend. His lease ends July 1st and mine, after my roommate begging me for a lease extension, ends August 1st. We signed a lease for an apartment beginning August 1st, and I spoke to my roommate, who had signed a lease beginning June 29th, and was more than happy to unofficially sublet her room to my boyfriend from July 1st to August 1st. Everything was settled. Wrong.

She got an internship beginning May, so she tried everything she could to get out of paying rent for June. She asked me if boyfriend could start in June; he couldn't. She posted an ad looking for a sublease from mid\-May to August 1st, even though we had verbally agreed that boyfriend would sublease from her. I was okay with that \(boyfriend could find another sublease. Not ideal, but we could work it out\), except she posted for ""two people"" since our rent is quite high and she was sure she wasn't going to get one person to pay it. I told her I wanted to vet the subleasees, and that I wouldn't be comfortable with two people staying in one room in our two\-bedroom apartment. She flipped out at me, ranted for a while about how my boyfriend is over all the time. To those wondering: he is over maybe about 50&amp;#37; of the time; we stay in my room unless we're cooking in the kitchen, she never had a problem before, she never once mentioned it to me before I had a problem with her ad. She didn't find a sublease, said she would pay her rent for June, and left for her internship.

Fast forward to yesterday. She calls me, and tells me that a friend and her parents need a place to stay. Apparently, this friend's parents are over from overseas, are currently living in her room in her three\-bedroom apartment, and can't share a bathroom with the other roommates. So she is going to sublease her room for until June 18th to this family of *three people*, when I've told her before I don't want to be outnumbered in my own home. I say I will think about it. I call her back and tell her I'm not comfortable with the idea of an entire family living in our two\-bedroom apartment with me. She tells me, too bad, they're moving in tomorrow whether you like it or not. I lose my temper, say I'll pay her rent for June as long as she leaves me alone. She agrees easily.

The next day, I call my landlord and they say I have final approval about who moves in with me. They will not process any subleasing unless I give them in writing that I approve the new roommate. So I message her back, saying I have approval, I do not want three strangers in my house, and that I will not be paying the rent for June. She loses it. Says I'm being unreasonable and selfish and owe her either a\) rent for June and July or b\) one third of the rent for every *day* my boyfriend has been over and one third of all utilities. She says, if you don't pay the rent, you have to pay me all this back rent you owe me. And, to add to that, she says if I don't pay her this money, she will ""deal with me"" and ""make sure boyfriend doesn't step foot in our apartment until August"". I tell her, if she doesn't want boyfriend living here in July, he won't, but she'll have to pay July rent. She's like, ""Fine! But he's no*t allow*ed in the apartment!""

I don't think she can do anything about that. I think she can't tell me who I can or can't have visiting our apartment while she's off on the other side of the country. I *know* she can't get me to pay her money for my boyfriend hanging out in my room. I have this feeling of dread from the threats she's making, about trying to get me evicted etc etc. Is there anything she can do legally to me? Boyfriend is prepared to stop overnighting *immediately after* we get written notice that that's a problem. And we will, of course, find a new place for him to sublease.

**TL;DR** Roommate is trying to blackmail me into paying her rent for June and July, asking for money for my sometimes\-overnighting boyfriend that she's never had a single problem with before."

I’m 16 years old, just got my license, and am looking to buy a new car for my internship. I’ve searched around this sub for suggestions on what to get and it seems the general consensus here is either a Toyota Camry/Corolla or a Honda Accord/Civic is a good choice.

However, I’ve been looking around for a couple of months and I am having trouble finding any in my area (MD) with reasonable milage (sub 150,000) and little damage that fall within my price range. Is this a problem with the sites I have been looking at (CL, Cars.com, Autotrader, CarGurus, etc.) or should I expand my search to include more cars?

My criteria are:
Good Gas Milage (&gt;22 mpg)
Reliable 
Automatic transmission preferred but I’ve heard manual might be a better choice
Should be able to maneuver in snow

Is there certain years I should look for or avoid? Any general tips or suggestions for me?

Thank you in advance for all of your help!

8ji66h,665,2018-05-14,[MF] Hooking Up with the Hot Intern,Obvious_Throwaway29,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/8ji66h/mf_hooking_up_with_the_hot_intern/,"I've enjoyed reading gonewildstories quite a bit since I first discovered the subreddit a few months ago. However, it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I had any good stories of my own to contribute. I'm not the greatest storyteller in the world and I tend to be long winded, but I promise I'll get to the good stuff eventually! 

I'll start the story with a little background on myself. I'm a 30 years old white male with a higher up office job that requires working long hours.  I've always thought that I was a decent looking guy but definitely not a model by any means. To give you a good idea, I'm 5'11"", in good shape but not super buff, dark hair with a touch of grey and clean shaven. Between my job, going to the gym and sleeping, I barely find time to meet new people or have any fun. To make matters worse, my favorite intern in the department, let's call him Mike, decided to leave to take another position. He was the only person in the department that I had anything in common with, so I was very sad to see him go. Who else was I going to talk shit with about sports and video games? Martha, the 55 year old secretary? I think not. Luckily for me, life was about to throw me a bone. 

On Mike's last day of work, I had aligned a series of interviews with a number of applicants to find his replacement. The ideal applicant had to be both good at the job as well as someone I could get along with because I would be working with them closely on several large projects. When 9am rolls around, the secretary gives me a call saying that Sarah, the first interview of the day, is here. I tighten up my tie, pull up her resume on my computer and tell the secretary to send her on back. About halfway through reading the impressive looking resume I hear the knock on my door, knowing the nervous applicant was here to stutter their way through the interview. To my pleasant surprise, Sarah was an absolute knockout. She stood 5'6"", had an extremely cute face with big blue eyes, long blonde hair with a slight curl to it and a figure that even her business suit couldn't hide. She was wearing a pencil skirt that showed off her toned legs and her blouse was just tight enough to show off her 32C cup breasts. I stared for just a bit too long before regaining my composure but I didn't think she seemed to notice. As the interview goes along, I realize Sarah is not only beautiful, but is quite qualified for the job. She gives all of the right answers and asks all of the right questions. How could I not hire this girl? Once the interview comes to an end, we say our goodbyes and I walk her back out of the office towards the elevators. As she walks away, I catch one last glimpse of her tight figure and head back to my office.

The rest of the day was a complete blur. I kept going through the motions in the remaining interviews, but all my mind could focus on was Sarah. While the applicants kept talking themselves up, I kept imaging lifting her onto my desk, sliding her skirt up to her waist and kissing my way up her thighs until she's begging me to fuck her. I gave it a few days to act like I was thinking it over, but once I extended the offer to Sarah, she lit up over the phone and gave a very excited acceptance. She was to start the following Monday and it couldn't come quick enough. 

After a busy weekend full of family obligations, Monday finally came around and Sarah showed up looking even sexier than I remembered. It took every ounce of my energy to keep eye contact when I said hello for the first time that day. It wasn't until later that I was able to appreciate the view a bit more by catching a glimpse of her perfect ass walking past my office and down the hallway. As the week went along, I started showing Sarah the different projects that she would be working on with me. It got to the point where we let our guards down a bit and started to banter back and forth. In my head I even thought she might have been playfully flirting with me, but disregarded it at the time because I thought it was all in my head. By the time Friday arrived, I was falling far behind on my work due to training Sarah and getting her started and I knew this meant a late night at the office was in store for me, but I would power through it like I usually do. Towards the end of the day, Sarah stopped by and asked what my big Friday night looked like. Once I told her I would be staying in the office to work for a while, she made a sad face and asked if she could stay and help out on anything. Who am I to decline such a nice offer? I told her that she's more than welcome to get some overtime hours and help out, but was certain she was just trying to be nice. To my surprise, she actually said sure with a big smile on her face. 

As soon as 5pm hits, everyone in the office starts to filter their way out to head home for the weekend. Everyone except for myself and Sarah. The two of us sit down in my office and start to chat a little bit while doing some mundane office work. We talk about our backgrounds, do a little light flirting back and forth and all together just start to enjoy ourselves. After a bit of this, I print some papers from my computer and jokingly say ""You better get those papers off the printer for me. That's an order, young lady!"" To my surprise, she not only laughed at this, but gave the response back of ""Yes sir. I'd hate to get in trouble from the boss man"" and laughed to herself as she went off to the printer. As she brings the papers back to my desk, I playfully mention that she is great at taking orders and give her a joking smile.  Her response was one that I will never forget. She immediately fired back  ""well I definitely like taking orders from you"" as she bit her lip and gave the sexiest smile I've ever seen. Before I could think twice, I told her ""well in that case, you need to get yourself over here right now."" She gave a smile, a ""yes sir"", and strutted her way towards the chair that I was sitting in. On her way over, I made no secret that I was eyeing up her body. Staring at her hips as they swayed towards me in the tight fitting dress. Checking out the bit of cleavage just begging for my hands to explore. Then making eye contact with her as she straddled my lap. 

I immediately moved my hands on to her ass and pulled her body in towards me as we passionately started to make out. She slid her tongue into my mouth while I moved my hands up her sides, pulling her dress up with them. That's when Sarah leaned back a bit, lifted the dress up over her head and gave me the first real glimpse of her body. She was wearing a lacy black bra that could barely contain her breasts, had a perfectly flat stomach and toned legs that showed she worked out regularly. I reached behind her back and unhooked the bra, letting me see her breasts and hard nipples. I immediately put one in my mouth, sucking and kissing back and forth between her nipples, making her head fall backwards as she let out a soft moan. She then gave me a smile and said it wasn't fair that I was still fully clothed. Without saying anything else, she slid down between my legs and starting removing my slacks while I started taking my tie and shirt off. Once she had me down to my boxers, it was very evident that I was fully turned on. She started rubbing my hard cock through my boxers with one hand while the other started to lower my waistband. Finally, after what felt like minutes of teasing, she pulled the boxers all the way down, exposing my hard cock to the office air. With a gasp, she said how amazing my 7 inch cock looked. She immediately ran her tongue up and down the shaft before taking the head into her mouth, swirling the tongue around to play with the precum that was already there. The longer she kept going down on me, the more confident she kept on getting. Taking more and more of my cock into her mouth. Sliding her hands up and down my shaft as she got down and licked at my balls. Every time she could tell I was getting close to cumming, she would slow it down and bring me back off the edge while giving me that naughty little smile again. Finally, when I couldn't take it anymore, I told her to get up off of her knees and to stand in front of me. That's when I leaned forward in my chair, kissed her naval and slid her panties down to the floor, revealing her perfectly shaved pussy for the first time.

After lifting her up to sit on my desk, I got down and started teasing her with my tongue, running it around the edges of her pussy. Just allowing me to taste her. With every lick, I could feel her legs widen a little farther and could hear her let out soft moans. Finally, I let my tongue slide over her clit and could feel her body immediately tense up with pleasure. I kept teasing her much like she teased me. I kept bringing her right up to the orgasm and then would back off before she would go over the edge. I did this for about 10 minutes until she started begging me to fuck her. So I got up to my feet, turned Sarah around, bent her over my desk and slowly entered her from behind. We both let out moans of pleasure as I kept burying my cock deeper and deeper inside of her. We very quickly picked up the pace and I started fucking her from behind. Grabbing her hips with my hands. Giving her perfect ass little slaps of encouragement, which kept making her moan louder and louder. I could tell she was extremely close to an orgasm, so when I told her to ""cum for me baby"", she absolutely lost it. Her back arched, she let out loud moans and I could feel her pussy tighten all around my cock as the only words she could get out over and over again was that she was cumming. Right as she finished her orgasm, I told her how close I was to cumming myself. Sarah gave me a sexy look, immediately got down to her knees and starting sucking my cock as fast and hard as she could. It only took seconds before I blew a giant load of cum into her mouth and down the back of her throat. She tried to swallow it all, but by the time I was done, I could see my cum dripping down her chin and onto her breasts. 

We both sat there, completely exhausted, taking in what had just transpired. Luckily neither one of us seemed to have any regrets, because I offered my place to have a shower and a drink and she gladly took it. Needless to say, we didn't get much sleep that night. Since then, we have still been working together and have been hooking up almost every single weekend. We both decided that the office sex shouldn't happen again because it is so risky, but it sure as hell is something I will never forget!"

8jicz4,5,2018-05-14,"Newcomer, need some advice.",xPerfectPomegranate,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8jicz4/newcomer_need_some_advice/,"This is gonna be a long one, but since this is my first post, I figured it would help people to understand where I'm coming from.

I'm 21 year old woman now, and I've always known my relationship with my mother was unhealthy. My biological father walked out on my mother and I when I was 8 months old, and it never really bothered me. I didn't know any differently. I've had contact with him, on and off, through the years, but he has bipolar disorder and won't get help for it. All his life, he's let the emotional abuse he experienced as a child justify manipulating and treating everyone else around him like shit. But he's not really in my life, and so it's not really been a problem. I'm glad I'm not obligated to have much to do with him. He belittled my mother and made her feel like shit, constantly correcting her and making her seem crazy. He's definitely a narcissist himself, so I'm sure that didn't help her any.

My mother absolutely loves me. Like to the point that I think she's a narcissist parent as well. After my dad left and all she had left was me, I think she subconsciously injected her entire self-esteem into me. She remarried when I was around 6, and she's sometimes happy with my step-dad, but he's an alcoholic and she hates it. I sort of just let him do what he wants because he's been drinking since he was 11. It's sad, but he's a good guy for the most part who cares about our family. He just really likes vodka, and it can be a little embarrassing.

But my mother is just becoming so overbearing at this point that I'm worried there's no way for us to ever have a healthy relationship. She didn't have an ideal childhood either, she was born because my grandmother was having an affair with a woman in the early 60s, and my grandfather poked a hole in the condom they were using. He thought having a child would save their marriage. And I think the fact that my grandmother was basically forced into having another kid stressed her out, and that would explain why my mom has had an anxiety/panic disorder since she was 3. You'd think that 50 years later, she would've figured out how to handle it, but she doesn't seem like she has it figured out.

My childhood until like middle school was fine, and I can't recall my mom doing anything out of the ordinary as a parent. It was in middle school that things started getting weird. She was angry with me for wanting to dress like the other kids and wear Hollister and shave my legs. I really honestly wanted to do those things because I was made fun of for the way I looked, and how juvenile I was.

Around my freshman year of high school, she started complaining to me ALL the time. I felt like her sounding board, her therapist. She complained to me about her sex life with my stepdad, about how grouchy she perceives my grandmother to be (although my Nana is my best friend, and I think she's projecting onto her), and about how unhappy she was with her life. And this wasn't the occasional thing. Every time we were in the car driving somewhere, she would use the fact that I couldn't leave the conversation to just keep DWELLING on everything. She was sucking me dry and making me feel bad. She's told me that my half-sister (11) and I are the only reason she's alive. She has no history of self-harm that I know of, but it's still a lot of pressure to hear that.

I had a really bad breakup when I was 16, and the guy was my best friend who suddenly started verbally abusing me and just being a dick. And I was also starting college level classes at the time, so I was under a lot of stress, and so I began seeing a therapist for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). After a few months, I felt so much better about coping with my own anxieties and I felt like I had closure from the relationship. I continued to attend sessions though, as I honestly wanted to keep going. I talked about my mom. A lot. And my mom would remark in the car after she picked me up from sessions about how I probably spent the whole time just ragging on her... This therapist, and one I had for a while during my sophomore year of college, both agreed that I probably wouldn't have needed therapy if it wasn't for her. They both agreed that she was toxic and that I was totally justified in trying to set reasonable boundaries. Which was obviously like murdering my mother. Trying to tell her not to rant to me all the time just made her upset. She sulked like a child and acted as if that meant I didn't care about her. It was stupid.

Going to college was the best thing that ever happened to me, and I love my school, and I'm so happy there. That freedom of being hours away from home finally let me grow into the person that I wanted to be. But I would fucking sob every time I had to go home for breaks because I just didn't want to be guilted and expected to bear her burdens.

She's gotten slightly better in recent years about boundaries. She'll still make bitchy comments if I don't act how she would want or contact her all the time, but she's slowly learning that I'm sticking to what my boundaries are. But there are some things that are just fucking absurd. I don't have a license or a car because she has done everything in her power to prevent me from driving (she doesn't want me to be independent). It makes it really hard with school and work and she just pays for me to uber everywhere instead.

She also makes me lie and pretend that I'm a virgin, because she's more or less told me that I couldn't possibly be having sex out of a long-term, romantic relationship and not have something wrong with me. Girls who sleep around clearly have emotional problems- they need attention, validation, or are being peer-pressured. It's simply not healthy or normal for a girl to have casual sex. She'll fall in love with him for sure and get her heart broken... I won't get into it, because this topic alone is something I could write at length about, but the fact that at 21, I have to pretend I'm a virgin so as to not hurt her feelings, is absolutely absurd.

Now, for those of you who have made it this far (bless you), what prompted me to look up stuff about moms and wound up with me finding this subreddit was this ""poem"" that I found just dumped on top of my stuff at the top of the stairs this morning.

https://imgur.com/nRJe8f1

And I'm just so angry about it. I'm tired of being told that I don't love her and I'm hurting her, because I want to be a functioning, independent adult. I wouldn't push her away so much if she would stop suffocating me. She makes me feel bad for wanting to do things on my own, she gets angry when I don't want to cuddle with her or let her hug me all the time. She makes snide comments anytime something I say suggests something sexual about me and a guy (even if it's just that my boyfriend slept over at my apartment because I called him crying when I was drunk). 

And she won't admit that she's so negative or that she's a control freak. She just wants me to be her therapist and make her feel better about her shitty life, where a lot of the decisions she made, are why she lives in a small town with an alcoholic husband with a job she hates. It's as if she expects that it's my job to fix these things. And I can't. And I don't even know if I want to have a relationship with her half the time, because I feel like I'm her mother, and she's an emotionally stunted teenage girl who will try to fix everyone else but won't go get help herself.

I haven't brought my stuff up yet, so she doesn't know I've seen the letter, but I'm going to Los Angeles for an internship program in a few weeks, and I'd like to avoid having a blowout with her. I have no friends in this town, as my family moved here two years ago, while I was already in college, so I don't really have a way to not be home or to avoid her. I'm just pissed that she would just dump this on me, knowing it makes me feel bad."

You're bent over my desk, your body trembling under mind as I lean over you, my hand wrist deep in the front of your unbuttoned slacks as my fingers work your slick little cunt.

But when I feel you get close, I stop. I let you fall forward against the desk, groaning with frustration as I slowly lick your juices off of my fingers. ""Interns with boyfriends don't get to cum. Remember, baby girl?"" I press my lips to the back of your neck, sucking at soft, sensitive flesh as you shudder. ""You know what you have to do.""

I'm interested in an RP where a 'straight' girl has never had an actual orgasm in her life. She gets an internship her last semester of college, and she celebrates the night before her first day by celebrating with drinks. She gets hammered and has sex with my character, who makes her orgasm *several* times before the evening is through. She wakes up in the morning and, horrified and embarrassed, hurries off to her new job, only to find that her new boss just fucked her brains out.

The boss wants to have a Sugar Mama/Sugar Baby relationship with your character, but she resists, insisting that she's 'straight' and that she has a boyfriend. Her boss slowly seduces her, edging her over and over again throughout the work day, reminding her of the *actual* orgasms they had the night before.

So, will you dump your boyfriend and let your rich, older lover spoil you and fuck you raw?

Antwoorden van de ministers van Justitie en Veiligheid en van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit op de vragen van de leden Helder en Graus &amp;#40;PVV&amp;#41; over het bericht ‘Heibel om afschieten honden op Bonaire’ .   
&amp;#40;ingezonden 12 april 2018, nr. 2018Z06866&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
Bent u bekend met het bericht ‘Heibel om afschieten honden op Bonaire’?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
Wat vindt u van het feit dat de hoofdofficier van justitie op Bonaire van mening is dat loslopende honden op Bonaire mogen worden afgeschoten en dat dit per email ook aan de politieagenten is bevestigd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
Deelt u de mening dat de hoofdofficier van justitie op Bonaire hiermee in strijd handelt met de, door hem zelf aangehaalde, verordening die op Bonaire zou gelden? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
Deelt u de mening dat de hoofdofficier van justitie op Bonaire met de mededeling aan de betreffende politieagent “zeg dat je ze niet gevangen krijgt en schiet ze dan af” politieagenten aanzet tot liegen en zelfs tot het schenden van de ambtseed en dat dit een hoofdofficier van justitie onwaardig is? Zo ja, wat gaat u jegens de hoofdofficier van justitie op Bonaire ondernemen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 2, 3 en 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
De procureur-generaal op Curaçao heeft toegelicht dat de mededeling van de hoofdofficier van justitie in de juiste context moet worden gezien. Het optreden tegen loslopende, gevaarlijke honden was in de periode dat het betreffende e-mailbericht is geschreven ook in het driehoeksoverleg een terugkerend onderwerp. De gevaarzetting door loslopende honden op Bonaire was en is actueel. De insteek van het e-mailbericht was om, zeker als het om honden ging die daadwerkelijk een risico opleverden, gevaar voor mens en dier te voorkomen door in een situatie waarin het gevaar zich al had geopenbaard doortastend op te treden. Het ging volgens de procureur-generaal bij dit e-mailbericht uitdrukkelijk niet om een instructie of aanwijzing aan de politie, maar om een staccato-antwoord op de vraag van een collega die intern informeerde naar de mogelijkheden om op te treden tegen honden die eerder waren uitgebroken en buiten aanwezigheid van de eigenaar andere honden hadden aangevallen. De hoofdofficier heeft met de betreffende mededeling bedoeld dat wanneer gevaarlijke loslopende honden in een bepaald geval niet gevangen kunnen worden en moeten worden afgeschoten, in de rapportage moet worden opgenomen dat de honden niet gevangen konden worden om adequaat verantwoording te kunnen afleggen over het politieoptreden. De procureur-generaal geeft toe dat het e-mailbericht misschien wat onhandig is geformuleerd maar moet worden gelezen als een aanmaning om in dergelijke gevallen goed te verbaliseren. De hoofdofficier heeft in het betreffende e-mailbericht dan ook geenszins de intentie gehad de suggestie te wekken dat er in strijd met de waarheid geverbaliseerd moet worden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
Waarom gelden op Bonaire andere regels, of beter gezegd geen regels, inzake dierenwelzijn dan in Nederland en andere delen van Caribisch Nederland?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
Bent u bereid hier zo spoedig mogelijk een einde te maken, zodat in heel Nederland, inclusief de overzeese gebieden, dezelfde dierenwelzijnsregels gelden? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 5 en 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Europese en Nederlandse regelgeving is niet van toepassing in Caribisch Nederland, behoudens uitzonderingen. Bij de staatkundige hervorming van het koninkrijk op 10 oktober 2010 was uitgangspunt om de tot dan toe bestaande regelgeving van de Nederlandse Antillen te continueren als Nederlandse “BES-regelgeving”. Er is bijgevolg voor Caribisch Nederland geen regime voor dierenwelzijn zoals in Europees Nederland. Wel zijn in het Wetboek van Strafrecht BES dierenmishandeling en dierenverwaarlozing strafbaar gesteld. De openbare lichamen kunnen in het kader van hun autonome taakstelling beleid voeren ten aanzien van onder meer dierenwelzijn. Op grond hiervan heeft elk van de openbare lichamen van Caribisch Nederland regelgeving waarin mede aandacht wordt besteed aan dierenwelzijn. Voor een uitgebreidere beschrijving van de dierenwelzijnsregelgeving in Caribisch Nederland verwijs ik u naar de brief van de Staatssecretaris van Economische Zaken van 23 juni 2017.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gezien de grote verschillen tussen Caribisch Nederland en Europees Nederland, zoals op het gebied van de gehouden dieren, het klimaat, de economie en de geografie, zou het invoeren van dezelfde dierenwelzijnsregels disproportioneel zijn.   
&amp;nbsp;    
In dit verband merk ik op dat er wel zorgpunten zijn op het gebied van dierenwelzijn op Bonaire, maar ook dat er activiteiten vanuit het Openbaar Lichaam Bonaire of vanuit de dierenwelzijnsorganisaties ondernomen worden om de zorgpunten aan te pakken. Regelgeving vanuit Europees Nederland is dan ook niet aan de orde. Wel zal ik de ontwikkelingen op dit vlak volgen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ten aanzien van de situatie rondom het hondenbezit en het gevaar dat wordt veroorzaakt door loslopende honden op Bonaire, heb ik begrepen dat er op Bonaire, anders dan in Nederland, sprake is van een zwerfdierenprobleem. Met grote regelmaat komen er meldingen binnen van bijtincidenten waarbij mensen of andere honden, maar bijvoorbeeld ook geiten en andere dieren slachtoffer worden. nDe gevaarzetting door loslopende honden is de achtergrond van de mogelijkheden in de Hondenverordening om het gevaar te beteugelen.

8jjy6q,3,2018-05-15,Considering law school - Hastings vs. USF vs. GGU?,notmuchtotalkabout,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/8jjy6q/considering_law_school_hastings_vs_usf_vs_ggu/,"Hey, LSA! Never been to this part of Reddit before, but what the hell. I have... a lot of questions.

So I'm strongly considering law school (after much hemming and hawing). I'm about to graduate this December with a Bachelor's in American Sign Language Interpreting, and I have an Associate's in Humanities from CC. I was set to go to grad school for Linguistics at Gallaudet, but I couldn't ignore the desire to explore my options and fell in love with law. Over the course of my undergrad, I've taken plenty of disability advocacy-related courses and legal courses related to courtroom interpreting. I was always enamored by that setting, but now I realize why. I want to be on the other side of the action.

I have an interpreting internship slated for Spring 2019 that will end in May or June, so I'm trying for admission for Fall 2019. I want to stay close to home, which for me is San Francisco (actually 30 minutes North, but hey). Berkeley wouldn't want me. Hastings looks like a fantastic school to me, but I'm scared of getting denied. USF seems to be more doable. I've heard talk that GGU is predatory, but they'll also probably accept me, so hey...

About my numbers: before I knew about how LSAC GPA is calculated, I thought I was in the clear. My university GPA is currently a 3.9. However, I dicked around in CC, and though it didn't transfer to my four-year, it's coming back to bite me now! So I'm working with a 3.35, all things considered. I want to throw up. The good news is I have months to study for the LSAT and shoot for a 170+ to compensate.

What would you all recommend I consider when making my application decisions? I'll most likely apply to all three schools and decide if/when I get accepted to any. Do you think these options sound realistic? And what can I do in the meantime to boost my shot at Hastings? Sorry for the barrage of questions; thank you in advance!"

8jl50s,33,2018-05-15,I am that crazy girlfriend with BPD they talk about on Reddit comment threads,McBurnAway,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/8jl50s/i_am_that_crazy_girlfriend_with_bpd_they_talk/,"I am a goddamn nightmare and I am up shit creek without a paddle. 

TL;DR 7 years with the same FP, constant cheating, emotional manipulation, and other dick moves. 

(This is a confession and a warning in the form of an autobiography and you are not meant to root for me throughout this spiel.)

I got my BPD diagnosis at 17. but even before I knew what a Favourite Person meant, I was already persistently obsessed with this kid my age, Daniel. I dated Daniel very briefly in freshman year at 14-15, two years prior to my diagnosis and one year prior to me moving upstate without any means of contacting him. 

Daniel was my first high school boyfriend; my first date and my first kiss. In the four short months we were ""together"" (a very loose term, we were as romantically involved as you'd expect from two kids very immature for their ages) he helped me through depression, stopped me from cutting myself in a school bathroom stall and for the first time, made me feel so valued and wanted.

You can see how this would later become a recipe for disaster.

My family moved away, he didn't have a Facebook or a phone and from talking every day and seeing each other every day it was as if he never existed. 

Between sophomore and senior year, three years of never actually seeing Daniel in person, I would still obsess over him, think about him every day, try to look him up on any social media platform, try to find his face in every crowded room, play the same MMO's hoping we would end up in the same game, find him in the background of photos my friends would upload and print out that little screencap and keep it in my journal; the whole ridiculous lot. Ever so often I'd even take an hour long bus trip to his side of town hoping we would run into each other in the shopping centre and ""rekindle"" something that was never really there in the first place. 

Daniel and I were together for a whole of four months, and in the first year I spent without him I had fabricated an ideal version of Daniel; he was the knight in shining armor that would save me from myself and my self destructive behaviours yet again. He was wiser than me now, stronger than me. He would sense something was wrong and call me. After all, he must be the all-purpose cure to these brand new out-of-character over-emotional and physical outbursts, the antidote to this developing alcohol and upper dependency, the eating disorder, the anxiety. He saved me once, it just makes sense to assume he WILL do it again.

Over those three years I was involved with a handful of short relationships, minor crushes, a couple of one night stands, and one three-year serious relationship. I would never tell a soul about my BPD, much less any of my other symptoms or mental issues.

At 16 I started dating Tyler, an all around great guy; he had the same nose as Daniel, the same crooked smile. Tyler was sweet, popular, academically involved, on a national sports team. The early months of our relationship were as ideal as a direct to DVD high school drama would picture them to be. We were compatible, we were best friends, we liked the same music. I loved him, but nowhere near the extent of how much I would obsess over Daniel. Granted, over the course of the three years I dated Tyler I would sometimes go a whole day, very rarely almost a week without Daniel even crossing my mind. 

This was when I started to realise when it came to issues with obsession, love, honesty and commitment my unhealthy infatuation with Daniel barely scratched the surface. Even though I had coerced Tyler to leave what was his current girlfriend for me, I would get jealous of the attention he would give his female friends and his teammates. Early on in the relationship I would catch him harmlessly flirting, or taking them out to coffee, and in retaliation I would smash his phone, call him screaming if his friends came online and I even suspected he would be speaking to them. I was a goddamn nightmare. I brought him down about his appearance, his grades, every single vulnerability I could find. His love wasn't enough. At the time I wanted Tyler to be completely devoted to me and spend every waking moment with me. I wanted him to ""love"" me exactly the way I obsessed over Daniel.

Over the course of those three years I would cheat on Tyler. I would manipulate a close friend, Adam into thinking I had genuine feelings over him. But it was all a game to me, seeing how long it would take for him to obsess over me. I got my kicks from watching Adam run out half naked into the street in tears as I drove off after telling him something stupid dramatic and extra like ""I'm sorry but this was a mistake, I want to be with Tyler."" It was no mistake, I would play this same game with a few other unassuming guy friends and Tyler would forgive me each time he'd find out, begging me to stay with him all the same. Later on I would get quite adept at ensuring he would not find out.

I would routinely excuse my behaviour, assuring myself that this relationship didn’t really matter, his feelings wouldn’t matter, he would recover. This relationship was a placeholder, for when I finally get to be with Daniel again. (Of course, this mental gymnastic routine would never be deployed whenever Tyler made mistakes or hurt me) I would reassure myself that it would be a perfect relationship with Daniel, he wouldn’t treat me like this, he would be perfect for me. Daniel was the one who got away, albeit two, three years ago at this point, who will absolutely come back.

Tyler and I would continue to fight, to hurt, and to pretend that nothing is wrong for the sake of saving face. We were both the frog and I, my inability to control my emotions and urges alongside my reluctance to go to therapy, was the boiling water that was killing us. It was destroying him absolutely moreso. By the time we graduated high school at 18, I had torn down his confidence and self assurance to the point that he was almost a broken down shell of the human being he was when we met. 

We were still together when we were both accepted into an excellent program at the very prestigious university conveniently situated at the centre of town. There were five-ish high schools in the nearby area and almost all of the high achieving regional school leavers would be in the next year's first year intake. Daniel was one of them.

In a way, the remnants of my sane mind at the time knew it was a bit of a tall order to assume I would accidentally encounter Daniel again in such a big state. I proved the last of those rational brain cells wrong when I ran into Daniel in class halfway through the school year. I couldn’t believe it was him, I was shocked and elated. He had grown much, much taller, his voice was deep and his once curly brown hair was now a black-brown in messy waves around a very serious face. He spoke very softly and never minced words when we caught up over the three years we had lost contact. He was on a full scholarship, halfway through his freshman year already with an internship at an impressive firm. The characteristic modern knight in shining armour. I couldn’t fault him; on the surface he was inch by inch, word for word, the ideal I had fabricated.

Turns out, he missed me too. He had kept all the notes, the letters, the photos. He had never developed feelings for anyone after me, let alone even considered dating. It was a FP dream come true. 

I broke it off with Tyler without hesitation on my part. It had seemed screaming like a banshee and holding a cleaving knife to my neck was the only means of communicating “let me get into my car so I can leave” he was capable of understanding. I would later tell many versions of this breakup story, some of my friends think he was the one with the knife, some think it was pointed at me, most think we broke it off long before Daniel. I have told so many versions of this same story that the only bit of information reminding me of the real sequence of events is the police report he filed.

To cut the waffling short and to save the trouble of repeating almost the EXACT same story of manipulation, verbal abuse and paranoia again unless anyone is honestly still interested, I am 21 now and Daniel and I have been together for 3 years. I have cheated on him over the entirety of this time and he is more obsessed with me now than I was with him when I was 16. I still sleep around with Tyler (who never really let me go), Adam, Adam's girlfriend, work 'friends' married or not, Tyler's best friend, Daniel's best friend and other physical almost-replicas of Daniel who can give me the level of affirmation and attention I want when Daniel isn’t around.

I’m absolutely getting bored of Daniel, his FP pedestal is all but revoked. I’ve been sleeping around with a new guy, a new FP, Brendan, who is in every way as inexperienced as Tyler and Daniel were before I emotionally ripped them to pieces. 

I’m going to a psychiatrist for the first time tomorrow, I’ve got every Wednesday night booked for the next four weeks.

There’s no resolution to this story, please don’t wait five years to start therapy. If you feel like you’re an awful person, you probably are and no amount of mental gymnastics or internet enablers can erase all the things that you’ve done. I’m no mastermind villain for hurting people and getting away with it, I’m just the psycho ex people tell funny stories about to their next girlfriend.

8jlb8p,91,2018-05-15,"[LONG] On the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, here's a brief autobiography from my dad, forced from his hometown at gunpoint in 1948",skah9,ChapoTrapHouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/8jlb8p/long_on_the_70th_anniversary_of_the_nakba_heres_a/,"*My dad sent this to my older brother and sister 12 years ago,  his English is good but typing is terrible, I've edited horrific typos and anonymised it a bit. I visited Palestine with him in October last year, after 4 hours of interrogation in Ben Gurion airport at 4am. That week spent with him was the only time I've ever seen him blissfully happy*.

""I was born in Al\-Lod City in Palestine before 1948,I don't when exactly because my birth certificate was left in our house when we fled the war which was waged by the Zionists.

Al\-Lod City is situated in the middle of Palestine about 3km from Al\-Ramla City,40Km from Jaffa and 40km from Jerusalem.

I remember when I used to go buy things from the nearby shop when I was a little boy  in AL\-Lod before our eviction from the city by force in July 1948, ,and on my way to that shop I used to pass by St Georges Church and I used to look at the inscription of St Georges killing the dragon on the top of the church's gate.

I remember that I used to play with our neihbour's son , we used to play doctors, we used to call the doctor as Hateem\(we couldn't say Hakeem because we were too little\),and I used to play also with my cousin,he died before we were evicted from Al\-Lod.

I remember in July 1948,when the war was started by the Jewish forces,I heared the sound of bombardements,the Jewish soldiers came to us and forced us to leave at gun\-point,and they killed our little dog,my mother pleaded with them not to kill the dog,but they didn't listen.

We immigrated on foot to Bir\-Zeit which is about 30Km from Al\-Lod,and I was carried on my grandfather's and Father's shoulders,,lots of people died on their way from exhaustion,illness and starvation and thirst. **\(OP note: This was the Lydda Death March, also known as the 1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle\)**

We stayed in Bir Zeit between the trees without roof on our heads for about a month,and so was the rest of people who immigrated with us.

Eventually we moved to Aqabat Jaber camp,which was 2Km far away from Jericho,Jericho is very very hot,it is 258m below the sea\-level,the camp was not built beforehand,so every family just took a space in the desert\(as the place was like a desert,not inhabited\)and put a blanket or piece of cloth on 4 sticks as a shilter from the sun,later on the UN distributed tents,one tent for each family,we stayed in the tents for a year or two,it was very hard,as the winds used to blow the tents and sand storms were very frequent,in addition to the rough weather in Winter when it used to snow and the tents used to fall,nvermind the snakes and scorpions which used to visit us!!.

Later on the UN started encouraging people to build housed by giving us wood to make a roof and build housed from mud.

We were very poor financially as we left all our properties in Al\-Lod,my father opened a small shop in aqabat Jaber,but it didn't do well,so he closed it,and he went and worked in Farming in Al\-Kafreen in Alghor,but he stopped because he contracted malaria from there.My father then didn't work from mid 1950s,we depended on what we used to get from the UNRWA\(United Nations Relief and Works Agency\),they used to give us monthly donations \(to all the refugees\) of Flour, oil, sugar, soap, dates, and sometimes clothes,these donations were helpful,but not enough to live on,so we used to rely partly on what my Grandmother\(Allah yerhamha\)used to earn as a mid\-wife.

I was registered as a pupil in the kindergarden in YMCA in Aqabat Jaber,sometimes I used to go to school bare\-footed as I had only one pair of shoes which now and then used to need service,by patching the shoes.

Our life in Aqabat Jaber was so difficult from all aspects,the weather was so hot, there was no running water to the houses,no toilets inside the houses,we used and get water from a running canal about 2 km far from our house,the water was not pure.There was no electricity in Aqabet Jaber,so no electric lights,no fridges,no televisions.

When we wanted to visit the toilet we used to go and visit a communial toilet.

Financially as I said we were very poor,meat and chicken was a luxury for us,we used to depend on the donations from UNRWA,but still we couldnt afford to buy things like tomatoes,fruits,although they were very cheap.

In 1957,I moved to Hisham Bin Abdel Malek Secondary School in Jericho and was enrolled in 1st preparatory class,mt 2 elder brothers were already studying there.I used to go waliking from Aqabat Jaber to the school in Jericho sometimes because I couldn't afford to pay the bus fair which was 5 Fils\(half a piaster\),and sometimes to save the 5 fils and buy peanut from Jericho and eat it on my way walikng to Aqabat Jaber.

I used to take sandwiches from home to school in Jericho,my mother\(Allah yerhama\)used to put zaatar in a piece of bread to me and used to say zaatar makes you perform well at school,I used to believe her,but zaatar was the only thing available that could be taken to school,sometimes I used to take piece of bread only and used to moisten it with chilly sauce free from the school canteen.

In 1961,I moved to Al\-Rashidia School in Jerusalem,because I selected to study in the Scientific branch which was not available in Hisham School in Jericho,I used to travel daily by bus to Jerusalem and wake up very early to be able to catch the bus,Jerusalem was 35km far from Jericho,I had beautiful memories from Jerusalem,1st the city was very beautiful,we used to take our sandwiches and eat it under the olive trees and the eucalyptos trees near the Al\-aqsa and Doom of the Rock,and walk the beautiful narrow streets to the Church of Sepulcture,and occasionally go and eat konafa at Jaafar Sweet shop,that's whan and if we could afford to have 5 ps to pay fro the price of wakeyet konafa,as our financial status was still below standard inspite of the fact that my eldest brother Ismail was working,but his salary was only 18 JD,and he had a wife and children to support. **\(OP note: My dad did a dine and dash in the 60s at Jaafar sweets, which still exists. When he visited Palestine for the first time in decades in 1994, he went back to Jaafar to pay them back. The owner’s son listened to my dad’s story, cried and gave him free kunafa and a plastic tray that I still use\)**

I was clever at school,always from the 1st ten\(alasharah alawail\),my parents and my brothers were proud of me,the fact that my brother  was one year senior to me at school helped,as he used to help me sometimes,and I also used to study hard.

In 1964,I finished school and got 79.5&amp;#37; in the Tawjihi,so I was accepted to study medicine in Cairo University,this was a burden on my family,as this is an extra expenditure,but my older brothers managed to support me,I was not a spending person,I used to live on about 15 EL monthly,sharing the house and food with three other friends,I loved the life in cairo,as it has the Nile,the Pyramids,the Cairo Tower,the people were nice,and the University life was also different from school days.

In June 1967,the 2nd Arab Israili war strted ,and ended with the shameful defeat of the Arabs Armies,namel,Egyptian,syrian and Jordanian armies,which left the victorious Israil Army occupying the West Bank of the River Jordan including the holly Jerusalem and Al\-aqsa Mosque,and Gaza strip,which before that was under the Egyptian administration,and also the loss of Syrian Golan Heights,although during the war which lasted only 6 days we were mis\-informed by the Arabic Media,and were told that Israil is being destroyed and to prepare our selves to go back to our land of 1948.

I qualified in 1970,with grade Good,so I started training as an Intern in Cairo University Hospitals,but in September 1970 war broke between the Jordanian army and the Palestinian Resistence Movements in Jordan,and lots of Resistance fighter were killed and wounded,so I volunteered to go to Lebanon and traet the wounded people,but it happended that the wounded were prevented to come to Lebanon from Syria,so I finished in tyre,Al\-Rashidia Camp treating the Palestinian Refugees,it was good experience for me as I lived with the Palestinian Refugees in Lebanon and saw how poorly is their conditions,financially and health wise.

When I finished the internship year in June 1971,I was going to go to Lebanon and work with the Palestinian Red Crescent as a doctor,but I got a letter written by my brother,to come to Jordan because the family need me,so I changed my plans and returned the Cairo\-Beirut ticket,and went back to Amman,Jordan to find that my brother was in jail,as he was accused that he was in the political wing in Fateh,I was so upset because he was in jail,but in the meantime I was proud of him as a brother defending the Palestinian cause.

I was appointed as a doctor with the Jordanian Ministry of Health in October 1971,I had a month introductory period in Irbid,where I used to stay in the hotel sometimes and sometimes travel to Amman,after that month I was appointed as a clinic doctor for Sama Sodood,a bedoin village in the northern desert of Jordan,about 10km from Al\-Mafraq,the nearest city,it was hard to live their as a doctor,as I used to sleep and eat in the same room which was used for examining the patients,but it was good in a way that I was the only doctor there,so I used to go on trips in the desert while visiting the other clinics which I was supposed to visit once weekly.

I stayed in sama Sodood Clinic for about 6 months,then I was transferred to Al H4 clinic,whic is on the Syrian\-saudi\-Iraqi borders,I was given a good house there with a fridge,and 2 bedrooms,it was extremely hot there,but it was Ok,as I used to get extra money from seeing private patients who used to pay me in riyals,and syrian money,also I used to go on desert trips shooting pigeons.

In June 1972,I was transferred to Al\-Zerka Hospital,where I worked as a resident in Surgery,which I didn't like,so I changed to resident in Medicine later on,I stayed in Al\-Zerka Hospital until end of 1972.

In January 1973,I was transferred to Al\-Karak City,in the south of Jordan,I liked it,as the city is quiet,the weather was good,as the area was mountainous,and above all,it was the place where I met my Lovely wife,she was a school teacher in Ghor Almazraah,which had a clinic close to the school,I met my Lovely wife as a patient first,She was the Headmistress of a girl's school with about 10 pupils,in the first place,I was trying to be clever,so I wrote a report in the children's attendence clinic book,asking her totake care of the school cleanliness and hygeine!!,but when she came to me as a patient I fell in love with her,and that love flourished when we used to travel to Amman on the week\-end in the same car as passengers,and I couldn't avoid inviting her for lunch in Jordan restaurant in Amman,which she accepted. we had kebas and Mango juice,that was in June 1973.

Later in July 1973,I went to the shop which my future father in law used to run,and asked him for her hand in marriage,he asked me some questions,and told me he is happy to receive us in his house for asking for her hand officially,so I went after a couple of days with my two of my brothers, \(one who was released from Jail end of  1972\) to my future wife’s House in Al\-zerka\(I didn't take my father with us in case the answer will be a rejection,and I didn't want my father to be disappointed\).Her family agreed on the condition that a marriage contract should be within few months from the khotbah,we agreed and we decided to bring my father later on for official khotba.

I was transferred to Ghor Alkarak in February 1973,where I worked there in a remote clinic until about August 1973,when i was transfererred to Karak City,I stayed there until I resigned in October 1973.

In August 1973,I found working as a clinic doctor in Jordan is intolerable,so I decided that it is time to leave the country and do post\-graduate studies,so I decided to call the khotba off,and I sent a telegram to my future father in law telling him that I intend to do further medical studies,so I can't get engaged and marry within months,so things became un\-easy between me and my darling future wife,but we still continued to see each other,until her father found out, he forbade Amal to go out,and he wanted her to leave work,but she promised him not to see me,so she continued working,although I took an emergency leave from work to go and see her in Ajloun where she was doing a course there,and I asw her later in October in Al\-Karak castle where I told her that I am, leaving the next week to England, she cried and cried.

So I came to England end of October 1973,did clinical attachment at St Helier Hospital,Carshalton,surrey in November 1973,after that I did some locums in Yorkshire,and in February 1974,I got a permanent job in St Margaret Hospital,Epping,Essex,during the period since my arrival to England,I continued to write letters to my Darling and phone her,and we decided we should get married,so she convinced her father to agree,I sent an authorization for my late father Allah yerhamo to do the marriage contract on my behalf,which he did,and in march 1974 my Darling came to UK,we had nice life in epping,but when my contract with the hospital ended,I couldn't find a job,so life was hard for a while,until I found a job in Rotherham, which she didn't like,so we moved to Pembury,and continued this way of life until we moved to saudi Arabia in 1983\-84.Life was completely different in saudi arabia,specially for ladies who couldn't drive,as driving is not allowed for ladies there,so it was boring for ladies,but they got used to it. **\(OP note: I don’t think my mum ever got used to living in Saudi\)**

My Mother Allah yerhamha died in October 1979,when I was working in Coventry, My oldest daughter was 2 moinths old,and oldest son was 4 years old,I was told of my mother's death at about midnight,next day I went to Heathrow airport, bought a ticket and went to Amman, but she was already buried,I visited her grave on my arrival,my mother was the gentlest and kindest and God\-fearing mother on Earth,she had a heart attack in 1973,was admitted to hospital in Amman during Ramadan,she was very ill,but insisted to fast, one of my brother’s used to open her mouth by force and put sips of water in her mouth.

My father Allah yerhamo died in 1987,while we were in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia,I travelled on the next day he died to amman and attended his funeral,my father was very wise,well spoken,although he didn't have any education,he could only write his name.

My contract in saudi arabia finished in June 2004,so we had to come back to England for my twin son and daughter, born in 1990 a few years after my father died, to continue their studies,

I hate it here in England,and wish I can go and live anywhere in the Middle East,I mean Palestine or Jordan or Egypt.

And that is my life,hope the rest of my life to be spent in the cause of Islam and Palestine.

8jlsk7,20,2018-05-15,An update on old CS Riven custom skin,TDPigs_Hi_I_am_me,Rivenmains,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivenmains/comments/8jlsk7/an_update_on_old_cs_riven_custom_skin/,"Hello fellow Riven enthusiasts,

I have been missing [this skin](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/144910154733715457/445947337655713792/pepehands.png) as much as you all do. However I also do seem to have a life, and I'm a student IRL so I had exams and group project (avoid those as much as you can tbh) and shit. Now is summer so I might find more time to work on the skin. Especially cuz I'm gonna have an internship for 3 months and I think working on the skin in the evening will be part of my routine.

For those who like the technical side of skins, I will attempt to copy battle bunny's particle code into championship and then start rebuilding from there. If such a manipulation isn't possible I'll have to rewrite everything from scratch. Which is long.

Anyways, I will be flying to Korea next school year for the second semester, and I gave myself a goal to have the custom skin done and 100% working as it was for then. So be sure to have it out in february 2019. Hopefully it comes out before though.

Anyways, enough rambling. Have a nice day ya'll, and trust me Pulsefire will help anesthetize your sorrow.

8jm8w0,2,2018-05-15,Quarkchain ICO summary,Abelwong89,QuarkChain,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuarkChain/comments/8jm8w0/quarkchain_ico_summary/,"QuarkChain ICO review:
1.What is Quarkchain:
Quarkchain is a highly scalable decentralized, permissionless blockchain that uses proof-of-work mechanism.
2. Problems with blockchain
As blockchain emerges on to adoption for the masses and institutional investors, we start facing issues that stay in the way of the implementation and adoption of the technology. Currently there are lot of debate going on  whether blockchain can be adopted in to the mass market most importantly, I want to focus on issues of scalability. That is one of the biggest obstacles to overcome before we achieve major adoption from the world. Think of Mastercard or Visa and the number of transactions they can complete in order to meet the demand of public needs. There are 3 core challenges that we as users encounter- decentralization, security and scalability. Normally, there is no other network that can has all 3 in one, one has to make a compromise and choose just 2 out of these 3. As we know that the world isn’t perfect. A good example of that will be that when Cryptokitties was introduced in 2017, Ethereum couldn’t handle the amount of users transacting, congestion of the network happened and took users a very long time to make a transaction. There is a reason why blockchain projects(ICOs) have done so well- the technology still lacks behind the idea and we need better infrastructure in order to change the current financial system for better.
Quarkchain promises to offers a highly scalable blockchain that can meet the global commercial demand/standard without compromising on security or decentralization.
3. The main features of QuarkChain
Simple account management- only 1 account needed for the all the blockchains(shards) in Quarkchain. All cryptocurrencies from different shards are stored in one smart wallet. A user will be able to manage all addresses in all shards via a single private key.
Anti-centralized horizontal scalability- Quarkchain allows multiple cheap nodes that form a cluster to replace a super full node (that can be very pricey).
Quarkchain will support smart contracts via EVM. Most of the existing DApps that are built on top of EVM can be directly deployed on Quarckchain. To utilize high-scalability, Quarkchain will provide additional scalability-aware interface.
Simple account management- only 1 account needed for the all the blockchains(shards) in Quarkchain. All cryptocurrencies from different shards are stored in one smart wallet. A user will be able to manage all addresses in all shards via a single private key.
Guaranteed security by market- driven collaborative mining-basically, to ensure the security of all transactions at least 50% of the overall hash power is allocated to the root blockchain preventing double spending attacks. This means that there will be collaborative mining (incentive mechanism) included.
Reshardable two-layered blockchain-Quarkchain consists of 2 layers. The first one offers elastic sharding (a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases the into smaller, faster and easily managed parts called data shards). The second layer-also known as root blockchain- confirms the transactions (blocks) of the first layer. The second layer can also be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.
Efficient cross-shard transactions. Two types of transactions: in-shard and cross-shard. In-shard transactions -when the input and the output addresses of the transaction are in the same shard. Cross-shard-when the input and output addresses are in different shards. The cross-shard transactions can be issued at any given moment and confirmed within minutes. The speed of the cross-shard transaction increases as the number of shards increases.

Token Utility: QKS-interim ERC-20 tokens are issued that will be later converted to Quarkchain’s native token once the mainnet launches in Q4 2018. The QKS token can be used as value carrier, transaction currency and contribution reward. QKS will be mineable hence providing a reward to the miners.
To sum it up: Quarkchain is aiming to improve the current blockchain space by significantly increasing the TPS (transactions per second) to a million per second. This will provide a free of congestion affordable network that will serve different purposes and help for the adoption by big industries and businesses. Quarkchain also incentivizes weak miners that don’t have to join mining pools in order to participate in the network. The big picture includes a seamless platform that supports distributed social media, high frequency trading, IoT, gaming, integration of DApps on mobile phones(DApps2go) and financial payments

5.Verdict:

Pluses:

Strong team and advisory board
New blockchains tend to perform really well in the ICO world
Positive MVP feedback from known tech experts in the crypto community, who have tested the alpha/github
Minuses:

1 million TPS seems like a tall order at the moment
No major partnerships have been announced yet
Strong competition- most notably Zilliqa, Ethereum, Fusion and more
Lack of technical whitepaper. I believe the current whitepaper is a bit basic and vague when it goes down to the technology used
Overall, I am really excited about the project. Missing information needs to be added by the team soon, I would have liked to see some partnerships announced and more details about the token metrics/collaborators, but that’s coming in the near future anyway. The 1 million TPS claim also concerns me to some extend, despite the MVP and the good team. Blockchain projects tend to perform really well, just think of another highly scalable platform like Zilliqa.

Quarckchain comes with a strong team and a reasonable hardcap of 20 million USD. On top of that- unlike some recent projects such as OneLedger and pChain, Quarkchain already has a working MVP and a public testnet expected in May. As I mentioned previously, scalability is one of the key issues that stays in the way of mass adoption of the blockchain technology. Finding a project that doesn’t compromise high-throughput for security or decentralization is a big plus. It’s a very competitive space they are entering and the market conditions are shaky, however I will be following the project closely and I am definitely bullish on it."

Maybe I'd say a few words to you every now and then, have a pleasant conversation, maybe even get a picture at the end, but I mostly did it to help out the potential of working in movies later on in life.

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

---

Hey! I'm Matthew, 21 years old and I'm looking for a girl to play as a celeb on this big movie premier. Ideally the two of us flirt for a little bit before sneaking off for some alone time. This can be as vanilla or as kinky as you desire, either way is perfectly fine with me.

Favorite Celebs: Emma Watson, Emma Roberts, Scarlett Johannson, Ariana Grande, Victoria Justice, Jennifer Lawrence, Alexa Bliss, Becky Lynch, Dakota Kai, Nadine Velasquez

I hope to hear back from some of y'all, and if you want to play one of my previous prompts I'm always open to those as well!"

I have always dreamed of being a writer. I've instinctively known that I wanted a career in the arts \(drama/writing/music\) since I was thirteen, and I have worked damn hard since then. But because of a few situations I had to leave the country I was studying in and move back to my homeland... It took a toll on me, but I managed. Homeland is a place where the majority of kids are science\-y kids, and at some point I \(subconsciously? peer pressure? idk\) decided that writing wasn't going to get me anywhere. 

So, I decided to become a doctor. Failed at gaining an admission into any university.

Last minute decision was to become a engineer, and I was ok i guess with following the crowd.

Did some writing on the side, got published on a few sites, self\-published on amazon etc...etc...

Which is great and all..... but I am 100&amp;#37; not ok with following the crowd... 3 years of engineering taught me that.

Honestly. I'm graduating out of engineering college in a year and I'm already soooooo sick of it. This isn't the field for me. I want to go back to writing/publishing full time, but no one will take me seriously/give me a chance *without a degree in a related field.*

So I decide to look up courses and I fulfill most of the requirements for an MA or an MFA.... except one: references \(recommendations\) however you call it.

I have no way to obtain references because I am not from the writing field and no one will give me a job or a internship because my degree is not related to the field \(believe me I tried everywhere... and all I have is a pile of no's\) \(science\-y country remember..?\)

I'm stuck in a downward spiral that I can't seem to get out of.

Whats a dream if you can't follow it....?

As a last hope I decided to write it all out here..... I'm not sure how this will solve the problem and I really wanna get better than being stuck in a hopeless loop.

What do I do?"

i have been using the arm implant for birth control and when i change it the doctor said to not worry because the previsous one was working so I didn’t worry... so i think the implant killed the baby, i don't know the cause.

he was on his internship and i only would talk to him dinner time... i went to a doctor just thinking ""what should i do?, i need to talk to him, I need him"" well, i got my appointment and the doctor noticed the baby was half of the size and no heart beats, was dead. they explain why the test was positive even he was dead cause my body didn’t recognized the fetus as dead and kept producing the hormone that gives you a positive test ... they sent me home saying i should wait a couple weeks and wait for my body expel its own...
few days later i was home chilling and i started bleeding so much with a huge pain... i couldnt stand up for long... i kept bledding and in pain for 3 days - remember i was alone - till i started to feel dizzy and weak, i went to the hospital to the urgencies at 11pm I waited till my boyfriend feel asleep to go and to tell him to not worry him...

 and i was immediately saw by a doctor, he said i needed to do a curettage because my body wasn't being able to expel the baby for its own, so i got that huge hemorrhage - a curettage is used to scrape the uterine lining.

he also said i may need to get blood and i had no choice unless do to the curettage to stop the bleeding... you know the bags when you donate blood? i lost approximately like 2 bags of blood. 
i was so weak and tired i just said ""sure"". 
i don't know if in this procedure is required an anesthesia because i know girls that did the same thing without it, or he just had mercy on me... i didnt feel anything but it was the worst moments of my life... i had to stay at the hospital for a couple hours cause i hadn't no one to take me home and i had to walk a mile to home...
i spent a lot of money on medicadion and a few weeks later i had an uterus inflamation... more drama and still alone, just my boyfriend knew and he wasn't there to hold my hand.

 i asked if i still can have babies and the doctor said would be hard but i have to do an exam to be sure after i have 6 periods... a year from now- due the arm implant i've almost no period... and this waiting is killing me inside tbh...
i thought it was all over but it wasn't. i have the same nightmare for 3 months, where someone takes away my baby away...
i was a super happy girl, i loved doing things outside and be surrounded by people... and now i just want to be alone at home... talking with no one... my boyfriend's back but i still unhappy and miserable as always... i don't talk to him about this anymore... and something I isolate myself from him too... 
i think he's sick of seeing me crying over this... he says i can talk everytime i want about this but I don’t want to bother him everyday... he says to let it go but i thing i'm not ready yet to let this go yet... last time I had a break down I say in tears I wanted my baby back and this is why I don’t want talk with him about his
... I said it cause I was in a really dark place that time and I don’t want him to feel pressure or bad when I say this kind of things because I know it’s to soon for him and for me...
Sorry for the super long text but I needed to take it out of my chest"

**Set:** [24] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/wiki/sets) 
____________________

John blinked, hiding the tears.  This wasn't right, this could still be fixed. An intern would rush in at the last moment out of breath with a memo, telling them that Superman made a miraculous recovery and that everything was off. No intern was rushing up the stairs. Another blink.

 &amp;nbsp;

He picked up his papers from the chair next to him, staring at the ink dotting the page. He had spent all night writing it, over and over, with help from his former speechwriter. Most of what hadn't gone into Suarez's State of the Union address found its way into his funeral speech. 

 &amp;nbsp;

He glanced around at the people around him. Two speeches to be given, by himself and Diana. The last time they did that, Superman had flown in at the last minute to save them from an attack. He couldn't help that it'd happen again, not unlike a child who hopes for Santa to slip down the chimney before sleep on Christmas Eve. 

 &amp;nbsp;

Chloe was there too, the voice behind the coordination during the fight. He hadn't even realized there was a puppet-master until well after, and it never really hit until the two had shook hands and introduced each other. She had complimented his bombing runs with Iron and Gold, calling it innovative. For some reason, Irons couldn't help but feel proud of himself for coming up with it.

 &amp;nbsp;

There was a person there too, Lois Lane. He worried about her, she had lost her fiancé during the fight in Metropolis, and yet came to pay respects to Superman as well. He had been told that Superman had saved the reporter's life that fateful day when the world found out about superheroes. He had to wonder if there was a closer friendship, though, because Superman had saved many lives over his time as a hero. 

 &amp;nbsp;

Wonder Woman was there. Thank the gods above she was. He wondered back to the first speech again. Was it fate that the two of them were the ones giving the speeches? Surely if any of the other members of the team were there, they'd be giving speeches too. But it just seemed to be him and Wonder Woman, with minutes left before the start of his speech and no commotion of approaching heroes. He hoped they were doing OK, he hadn't been in touch since he woke up on the examination bed after his fall.
They were all still alive, he knew that much. Superman was the only confirmed hero casualty of Doomsday, the rest had made it out alive for better or worse. The man from the future, the one they called Booster Gold, was still missing, but The Flash had adamantly refused to agree he was dead. Irons had seen the footage though, and he couldn't conceive of a way for him to survive. But until a body was discovered, more than what had already been found, he was marked as missing. 

 &amp;nbsp;

Lois Lane was in the same position; but her fiancé was presumed dead at this point. He wondered if she was feeling the same that The Flash was feeling. It's just that when the fastest man on earth shouts at you ""he isn't dead, you're wrong!"" and tears apart a hill outside Metropolis to try to get his attention, you leave the file as Missing instead of updating it to Presumed Dead. Admittedly, Lane's fiancé was just some normal person, and Booster Gold was from the future. 

 &amp;nbsp;

""Thirty seconds,"" a quiet voice called, signaling the start. John got up, trading glances with the heroes sitting around. Traditionally, the media would only call Wonder Woman a hero here, perhaps Steel as well. But today, they were all heroes. None of them could've done it without the other. He hoped that even with Superman gone, they could remain close, remain a shield in front of the world against the threat of malicious intent. ""Now.""

 &amp;nbsp;

\||||||||||||||

 &amp;nbsp;

John placed his papers down on the podium. So much rewriting for this moment. Somehow, this was the hardest speech. Four years of speaking, and the eulogy for a man he didn't even know the first name of. Another blink, a deep breath, and it was time to begin. 

 &amp;nbsp;

""My fellow Americans. In history, certain discoveries and inventions change the landscape of society as we know it. The car, the telephone, and the internet are just a few recent examples of fantastic inventions that changed humanity."" John started, noting the confusion in the crowd. A few faces lit up, however, realizing.

 &amp;nbsp;

""A long time ago, I spoke those same words, after an unnamed man revealed himself to the world to save the people of Metropolis from an experimental plane about to crash. That man was Superman. On that day, our world changed. Our world has changed once again.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""The alien known as Doomsday came to our Earth in an attempt to destroy us. And, had it not been for the combined effort of some of Earth's greatest heroes, he may have succeeded. Today, we pay respect to those lost in that battle.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""A recent report put the deaths in the tens of thousands. Given the circumstances, this is an incredible number. Not only did heroes contribute to that, through evacuations or distractions or fighting, but all of us who helped at the camps and hospitals. All of those who kept society running so that those who needed to focus on the injured could. I could go on for decades about how strong humanity is when we band together, but we are here for another purpose.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""I met Superman what feels like ages ago. In this very city, I gave a speech introducing Wonder Woman to the world. At that speech, we were attacked. Superman flew in, joining Wonder Woman in rebuffing the villains. I could do nothing. And yet, he told me something that has stuck with me since. I told him that he was a true hero, and he told me that we weren't different. He helped people, I help people.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""Today, the world mourns the loss of Superman. In such a short amount of time, he became our friend, even for those of us who didn't meet him. A bastion of hope personified, Superman brought us into a new world in the perfect way – with hope and love. It is with sorrow and regret that the world continues on now without him.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""Superman left us with hope. We wake up in the morning, filled not with fear but with dreams. Not the horror that someone may perhaps take our loved ones away from us through methods we don't understand, but the desire to improve and understand the world more than we do. Our discoveries are not one of land or space, but of humanity and the extent of ourselves. Already there are people who are pushing our understanding of what we are as a species. And for that, we have Superman to thank."" 

 &amp;nbsp;

""His last decisions perfectly show who Superman is as a person. Serving his duty in the court of law, showing that none are above the rule of the people. Only leaving when the judge permitted it, he went straight to the fight. Superman, among many other heroes, fought tirelessly to minimize the destruction. It is because of them that there is even anyone today. For that, we can only give thanks.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""As the sitting President when Superman was first revealed, I remember many documents detailing just how the government should react when a metahuman did eventually go public. Almost every single one of those papers discussed how to combat a hostile threat. It is not luck that Superman set a standard for metahumans, and some of the most well-known metahumans allied themselves with him to provide a group for everyone to look up to. This is thanks to Superman.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""There was no hesitation in the final moments. Simply the realization of what needed to be done, and it being done. No passing around responsibility, no discussion of who should be the one to take down Doomsday. I fully believe that every single one of those heroes would've done the same if they'd have the opportunity. Superman had the opportunity and took it. Because of that, we are still here. Because of that, humanity is stronger as a species. That credit goes to Superman."" 

 &amp;nbsp;

""But Superman is not a movie character. His story does not start and end with SunKord and Doomsday. I can only imagine the endless good that Superman has done the world that did not make national news. The same goes with every one of the heroes in that fight, both metahuman and not, as well as anyone else in the world. It's easy to get caught up in the pictures and videos, but Superman set a standard that heroes helped. There was no ego. Thank you, Superman.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""His story does not end here. The legacy he left has changed this world, perhaps more than any other person ever. The statue to be in this park, the memories that each of us hold, that is his legacy. Not only his individual activities, but the change he caused. Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, everyone else. That was Superman.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""Rarely does humanity lose someone that was purely good. Oftentimes, after the death, stories start circulating of a person's demons, their questionable decisions and moral faltering. I think I can confidently say that there will be none of that for Superman. I would be far more likely to believe that those naysayers have a bone to pick, or perhaps an agenda."" 

 &amp;nbsp;

""However, we lost someone purely good. And yet, the world still turns. That is thanks to Superman. We avoided a disaster, likely one that would've ended the world. We lost possibly our greatest defense against threats on that level, but others will step in to fill those shoes, however great that challenge will be. Thanks to Superman, the world still turns.""  

 &amp;nbsp;

""Superman showed us what humanity can do together. Nations across the world contributed, humanity banding together in support of each other. Even those who were directly impacted did what they could to help. I don't know if that would've happened without Superman. Today, humanity showed what it could do facing adversity.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""From today on, we live in a world without Superman. But this does not mean anything is over. Remember Superman, and what he stood for. Do good, not evil, and make the world a better place. He was a true hero. But we all are not that different. He helped people, you help people.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""Every single person has endless potential for good. Chase that potential like Superman did. He may be gone, but that does not mean the world has to be any more worse. Together, we can fill those shoes he left, and continue making the world a better place."" 

 &amp;nbsp;

\||||||||||||||

 &amp;nbsp;

John sat back down, the applause quietening as Diana took his place to speak. Speeches were always exhausting, but to do a eulogy took even more out of him. The rest of the time on stage blurred together, and he found himself back in his car, being driven somewhere. A moment of panic flashed through him, but the familiar back of his chauffeur calmed him.

 &amp;nbsp;

""Where we headed?"" 

 &amp;nbsp;

""Magnus had a thing or two to show you. Said it was urgent, and that you wouldn't mind.""

 &amp;nbsp;

Irons couldn't help but laugh. Was he so predictable that even his chauffeur knew that? Magnus was right, John certainly wouldn't mind another afternoon spent with Will to distract him from recent events. He'd probably still be working on repairing the two Metal Men who had been injured in the fight. John's suit was already back in business, Will was picking up the suit's intricacies quickly and could repair more common problems within an afternoon.

 &amp;nbsp;

""Alright, here we are,"" a voice brought him back to Earth. He nodded, thanking his chauffeur as he stepped out and made his way towards the gate. At some point, he told himself, he'd have to remember the man's name.

 &amp;nbsp;

William was rich and introverted, and it showed. Sometimes while heading down the path, John wanted to imitate it for himself, but living on a ranch far from actual civilization in the middle of Virginia was too much of an adjustment from the Baltimore suburbs that kept him in the middle of all the action.

 &amp;nbsp;

""Welcome!"" Will called out, standing up from his porch chair when John turned the corner. The two men greeted each other, exchanging post-death formalities before heading inside.

 &amp;nbsp;

""How are Gold and Iron?"" 

 &amp;nbsp;

""Full recovery, thankfully. I've got them some new friends, too."" Magnus said, sliding a door open.

 &amp;nbsp;

""Hello, sir."" Two pair of eyes met, but not John's.

 &amp;nbsp;

John froze, his mind racing. There wasn't a problem with it, necessarily. There was no reason that Gold and Iron couldn't be that, he had just never considered the possibility. He wasn't a builder of robots, William certainly knew what he was doing. But still, it felt odd. Unexpected.

 &amp;nbsp;

""John, meet Tina.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""Hello, John."" Tina replied, putting down her book and standing up. ""Is this a friend of yours, Will?"" she said, smiling.

 &amp;nbsp;

""Long time friend. He is the hero Steel.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""Oh, so he's already met Gold and Iron, then?""

 &amp;nbsp;

""Tina... Tin?""

 &amp;nbsp;

The woman's eyes blazed, if metals eyes could. ""I am Platinum.""

 &amp;nbsp;

John nodded, apologizing. ""Ah, Pla-Tina-m. I understand now!""

 &amp;nbsp;

After some more brief small talk, the two left Platinum. ""She mostly addressed you, I noticed. Intentional?"" 

 &amp;nbsp;

Will sighed. ""No, not really. I'm wondering if it's a faulty Responsometer. There's no reason she should be acting this different around me. She's fine when she's with her brothers, but when I'm around suddenly I'm the only thing in the room.

 &amp;nbsp;

John's eyebrows raised. 

 &amp;nbsp;

""This is Mercury. Don't tell him you're Steel."" Will warned, pressing the button. 

 &amp;nbsp;

A red metal man stood instead, jabbing a sandbag hoisted to the roof. His counting stopped suddenly as he turned to greed them. The symbol for Mercury lay on his forehead, and John couldn't help but wonder if Platinum should've been Mercury. 

 &amp;nbsp;

""Got a job?"" Mercury asked, bobbing up and down like an impatient wrestler.

 &amp;nbsp;

""No, not right now, Mercury. Just introducing you to a friend.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""Steel?"" John watched the man eye him up and down, as if he was wondering if he'd make a good sparring partner. Maybe with his hammer...

 &amp;nbsp;

""No, this is a friend, John. He might lead a few jobs sometime down the line."" Will said, not returning John's glance. Don't tell him that he was Steel, sure, but was it necessary to lie?

 &amp;nbsp;

""Shame.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""How are you?"" Will asked, looking behind him at the broken sandbags laying around.

 &amp;nbsp;

""Is bored an answer?"" Mercury cut, a faint smile crossing his face.

 &amp;nbsp;

""Yeah, fine, this time. Take out your garbage when you're done, alright?""

 &amp;nbsp;

The man nodded, turning back to his sandbag and counting from the start again. He got up to twenty by the time the door closed.

 &amp;nbsp;

""You lied?"" John asked, confused.

 &amp;nbsp;

""You wanted to fight a man with the fighting skills of Muhammad Ali and the body of solid metal?""

 &amp;nbsp;

""Point taken.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""There's two others, but for now Mercury and Platinum are the ones up and functioning. Gold and Iron too, but you've met them.""

 &amp;nbsp;

""Indeed. Are you going to make more like those two, without weird or awkward personalities?""

 &amp;nbsp;

""I think you'll come to like Mercury, he's good in a fight. And Platinum, well, I don't know what's wrong with her.""

 &amp;nbsp;

John shrugged. ""So long as they work together and don't squabble in a fight.""

 &amp;nbsp;

He didn't notice Will bite his lip. ""Let's go to your suit, shall we?"""

Do you think getting good at a popular framework (React) would be better or to specialize in an upcoming technology (I'm thinking dApps)?

8jp10w,2,2018-05-15,I've been home for 6 days and got yelled at for 5 of them,salinasailing,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8jp10w/ive_been_home_for_6_days_and_got_yelled_at_for_5/,"Context: I finished college and am back home for a couple of months. I have an internship lined up which should, I'm hoping, transition into a permanent position once the summer is over. \(Future boss and I have been discussing this and will go into more detail later this week\) I'm practicing to get my driver's license, and I'm home because my parents' cars are essentially the only ones I have access to. A friend is sitting in the car with me while I practice, so I don't have to deal with them. If I get the internship I'm moving out because my parents' house is a bit out of the way.

My mom will find anything to yell at me for. Baked cookies? Got yelled at for not putting away other dishes in the rack before I started backing. Made lunch for Mother's Day? Got screamed at for not making it right away \(we got home and out of complete force of habit I went to my room and got out a book\). Put on a movie for her? Got bawled out for not watching it with her \(I specifically told her a few days ago that I wasn't going to watch it with her because it made me cry really hard, and she likes doing things by herself a lot\). Made brownies like she asked? Got yelled at for not making dinner first like she also asked me to do. I'm staying at my sister's tonight \(Sis lives in a dangerous area \-\-only place she can afford\-\- so I'm NOT looking forward to it because I have no place else to go\) because I have a friend's graduation party farther away and won't be able to get home by bus.

My sister and I think she may have manic\-depressive \(Sis and I both have been diagnosed with mental issues\) Sometimes she just will not stop babbling. I'm also autistic, so I get sensory overload a lot. I try to smile and nod and go along with what she's saying but my brain gets overloaded and I feel like I'm choking. My dad is awesome and tries to give me advice, and he likes talking to me a lot \(he doesn't have a lot of friends\). I love my dad, but huge stretches of the day with people nonstop talking to me is just too much. Yesterday I started stimming and crying and kept repeating ""I have to go to my room"" because I literally could not listen to anyone anymore. My dad is more understanding of that sort of thing but I'm bracing myself for a BS ""Don't let her get to you, like water off a duck's back. Don't let the negative energy drag you down"" when he gets home. He's a bit narcissistic too so I have to listen to him like he's the ultimate authority. Sigh.

My  mom has agreed to go to therapy as soon as summer starts since she'll have more time with school. So I'm hoping that works out. Sometimes she's very nice and I really like her, but there is something seriously wrong with her and unstable, and it's breaking me down. Unfortunately, I don't have anywhere else to go. I just have the reprieves when she's away at work or when I'm out.

I would love to ask a friend if I could stay with them for a while. Most of my friends are guys and she doesn't want me staying with guys. She'd rather me be at my sister's awful place. It's rife with drug dealers, mentally ill homeless people, it's dirty and just dangerous.

Please help, I need advice. I could leave when I get the job but how am I going to get my license? I'm going to need to do some serious asking among my friends... Thankfully I do bake well so I can offer that for compensation if they don't want cash or something."

I recently got promoted from an intern to a full time employee at my current job making $12.50 hourly. The pay definitely isn’t great for the job but my hope is that I’ll get bumped up a few dollars in upcoming months. I’m also going to be living onsite for the next few months over the summer living rent free, so I’ll have a couple months worth of paychecks saves up before we move out in September. 

Bill breakdown:

 After taxes, I’m making about ~$1,300 monthly 

Rent: $600 

gas/electric: $60-$200(max) 

Student loans: $300

Internet: $40

Cat rent: $25

Leftover ~$100 will be used for gas/groceries 

(renters insurance has already been paid for the year so I didn’t include) 

I don’t expect utilities to run that high where we are staying, just in my current apartment our place doesn’t have insulation so our AC constantly runs in extreme weather, so just as a “worst case” I over estimated. 


Obviously this is not ideal, as I am left with no money to put into savings at the end of the month but it should be doable? My boyfriend makes more than I do and has offered to buy groceries and such as needed since he’s aware of my financial situation. The apartment I am staying in now is in the city, cheap and close to everything but the area is very unsafe. As the city is so dangerous, the surrounding suburbs are much more expensive in comparison since they are in such high demand. I’m ready to get out of here lol

What are some ways I can cut back in cost and save money? Looking for tips like running laundry/showering at certain times of the day, etc etc

8jppiy,1,2018-05-15,Graduating without debt. Advice?,gteruel,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8jppiy/graduating_without_debt_advice/,"Hello, 

I am a rising third year student double majoring in Computational Science and Economics. I am fortunate enough to have received enough scholarship to graduate without debt. I have a good car and there is really no big expenses I can foresee in the near future. I come from a culture where it is perfectly normal living with family for a few years post graduation, so I feel no rush to leave the house either. In fact, if money allows \(family is pretty financially limited\), I am considered grad school in Big Data and Data analytics. 

Additionally, I have no steady income other than what I am earning through internships I have had through the summers. 

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? How would you start saving and what moves might you make to place yourself on a positive financial trajectory once I get into the ""real world"". 

Thanks! "

I’m 23f and went from 160 to 190 this past semester after moving back home to complete an internship. Prior to my weight gain of 30 pounds I had lost 20 pounds using weight watchers. I know people have mixed feelings on it but it worked really well for me and I’d like to start it again because I think it’s the most realistic for me.  I know I need to start back on a healthy lifestyle but I’m not sure where to start. I don’t have a good relationship with food and I’ll be trying to make an appointment with my therapist to work through some of the mental / food addiction part of it. My main problem is there is always a reason I can keep pushing exercise or dieting back.. like this weekend I’m going to the lake with my friends so why bother starting now if I’ll just reverse my progress over the weekend? I know I can bring my own food, etc but I want my focus to be on fun with my friends not what I’m going to be eating. I just don’t know why I can’t stick to something and it’s making me feel terrible about myself. Sorry for rambling. Has anyone been in a similar situation?"
8jqr5l,5,2018-05-15,"Zelda Aziz, Aka, Scarlet Scorpion",TrueCaptainCrocs,SupersRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupersRP/comments/8jqr5l/zelda_aziz_aka_scarlet_scorpion/," ###CHARACTER BIO

**Name:** Zelda Aziz, aka, The Scarlet Scorpion

**Age:** 20

**Appearance:** Zelda is a 5'10, black haired, brown skinned, and brown eyed woman. Her costume is mainly consists of blood red, with accents of yellow. Her most distinct feature is, coming from her lower back, a 7 foot long, mechanical, scorpion tail style appendage.

**Mentality:** Zelda is a determined, and focused student, and a persistent researcher. She already is in her final year of schooling, and is mulling going for a doctorate. Her social life is pratically non existent, as she isn't much of a talker. But she is a hell of an observer.

Her biggest internal conflict is coming to terms with herself, and herself post accident. Zelda is worried that, because of her abilities, she may become a lab freak and only be used as a vessel for research. She feels that she has more to offer the world, and there if people work hard enough, they can make the world a better place to live. 

**Background:**

*From selected exerpts of Zelda's daily log.*

October 20th, 2014.

I have decided to restart my journal at a new point, because of extenous circumstances. Nearly month ago, on September 13th, a fatal error in a neighboring lab, in which an energy reactor being tested went nuclear, caused me to be severely injured. I can only remember working on my research onto developing an antivemon for a rare scorpion, then being knocked backwards.

From there, I was in a comatose state. Seven days ago, I woke up. It has been an adjustment, to say the least. But, fortunately, my rehabilitation went extremely well, and I have been released earlier today.

November 5th, 2014.

Something strange happened today. While in the cafeteria, I had a strange feeling, a tingling in my gut. I ducked, and narrowly avoided getting a drink spilled on me. Even odder, I still have this strange, burning sensation through my veins. It isn't painful, just odd. I have decided to go to the lab and run some test. Perhaps the accident might have caused some unintended side effects that the hospital didn't pick up on.

November 6th, 2014.

It is rare that I am absolutely surprised by lab results. Especially my own. But I have reviewed and done checked results all night. And, after seven tests, I have come to several conclusions.

My blood type is unknown. It matches none of the types known to science. Additionally, the chemical composition barely even resembles blood. It actually is closer to a toxin, much like that found in scorpion venom.

There are metallic, unidentified objects in various locations on my body. At first, I speculated this was shrapnel, but it is too perfect to be so. They contour perfectly to the parts of the body they are on. It's almost as if they were placed or molded there. But I can not find any evidence of scaring or how they where placed there.

November 16th, 2014.

I had an idea conserning the irregular composition of my blood. I can not exactly discern how I was able to come to such a radical idea, but I did test it.

I thought careful of the chemical composition of different liquids. The familiar, brief burning sensation returned, but after a period of 15 seconds, it slowly faded away. I then drew another sample of my blood. All three times I tested it, my blood had the composition of every chemical I thought of. Exact same properties and everything. For instance, one of the chemicals I thought of was gasoline. And, not only did it have the exact number of atoms I thought of, it also burned exactly like it should.

For now, I don't know what to think. Either I misread something, or it is likely I have some... ability. Not sure how to properly describe it. Anyways, any further exploration will have to wait, due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

December 2nd, 2014.

Now that I am back on campus and have my bearings again, I am focusing my attention onto the metallic objects that are imbedded into me. I won't have long, considering finals are fast approaching, and I have other, semester long projects looming toward a deadline.

For now, I have discovered six such objects. One on both my left and right forearm. One on both my left and right outer thigh. One on the back of my head, and one on my lower back. The contour to the brief shape of the areas they are located. More interesting, however, is that I am picking up readings of a strong frequency of electromagnitism. Maybe there is a way to interface and explore these... I need to come up with a name for them. Note: let's call them implants, for now.

December 10th, 2014.

For now, two updates. I secured an internship with a technology firm in Chicago, allowing me to stay in the metro area for the holidays, giving me more time to fully experiment and explore.

Secondly, I have finished prototyping a device to interface with the implant on my arm. It is a simple device, only real function is to turn a bulb on and off. Will see it it can securely fit and operate.

December 11th, 2014.

Late at night, so sort entry before I do a proper entry tomorrow. Experiment successful. Device stayed on. However, the light didn't turn on until I thought it should turn in. Testing revealed object did, in fact, respond to my thoughts. This means, somehow, the implants are connected to my nervous system. And explains why taking it off caused a great pain.

Will experiment with a more long term experiment regarding interfacing with this implant.

December 29th, 2014.

I am done prototyping a new device, which I shall call TAIL. The goal is to, essentially, give myself a third, modular limb, grafted onto the back of my spine. My estimate as to completion is a few months before I can have a working prototype.

I am also putting thought into a more long term use for these... irregularities. Perhaps, I can use them for the betterment of society, but I am unsure how. Currently, I am the only one that has all the pieces as to my abilities. But for now, I am focusing my energies into creating project TAIL.

March 3rd, 2015

I have done it. I have a mostly compete version of TAIL. It is ready for a connection test. However, if this is successful, I think that, for the most part, it is permanent. For if the smaller scale, test object was painful to remove, undoubtedly, TAIL will hurt even more, to the point of being unbearable. But I shall push on. For progress.

March 4th, 2015

The TAIL is functional. It is taking some getting used to, but currently, I can successfully utalize the grabbing function to grab a glass without spilling. So far, I haven't been outside today, as I'm afraid of reception. But I think it's time to test the other functions of the TAIL.

Later in March 4th.

Successful test of both hiding functionality and compressed air cannon. Will prototype a costume, for a street test.

**Reputation:** She's still a relatively new hero, only having started less than a year ago. As a result, she doesn't know anyone else in the super community, although she might identify a costume or two. There is a lot of mystery surrounding the sudden apperance of the Scarlet Scorpion, and for the most part, she doesn't do anything to answer for herself. As a hero, she isn't the most public of heroes, not even taking care to introduce herself or her cape name.

**Resources:** She has a workshop, based out of her apartment, where she prototypes and makes adjustments to her various equipment and costuming.

---

###POWERS AND SKILLS

**Power Descriptions:**

* Power One: Neural augments Focus: (Self)

Her body has grown mysterious, metallic augments into her flesh and bone. As a result, she can attach custom made equipment to her body, and it connects to her nervous system, allowing her to control it with a thought.

* Power Two: Blood Chemistry Focus: (self/generation)

Zelda has the power to manipulate the chemical component of her own blood without any negative side effects to herself. It takes her approximately 15 seconds to change the composition of her blood, and she has to be focused solely on it. She can only turn about 10% of her blood at once. She can do it again, but it would take another 15 seconds to add an additional 10% of her blood to the new material.

* Power Three: Scorpion Sense

Zelda can feel things around her in a twenty foot radius that have the potential to harm/ injure her. For her to sense it, it has to be an active threat to her. i.e. a seathed blade wouldn't be picked up, but a knife being thrown at her would. However, Zelda on has a general inclination that she is in danger, not the specific threat.

**Power Versatility:** Her most versitile power is her Blood Chemistry, since as long as she knows the exact chemical components of any liquid, then she can recreate it in her own blood. Her Neural Augments only serve as a connecting point to other technology that she invents/makes.

**Power Drawbacks:** anything connected to her through her neural network is connected to her as if it were a limb, meaning she feels pain if it's damaged or destroyed. She can't receive blood from other people, meaning blood loss is a problem for her. 

**Skills:**

* Skill One: Biochemistry

* Skill Two: Mechanical Engineering

* Specialisation: Tinker/Marksman

**Equipment/Weaponry:** (Focus: Self)

 * T.A.I.L (Tactical Augment for Injection Launch). A large, 7 foot long augment that rests at the back of her back. It  has several different functions. It can function as an arm, fold down into a smaller size to that Zelda can walk around in public,  and can be used as a launcher that fires special darts. The dart types are below. She makes them herself, using her powers (namely her blood), and very controlled doses. In addition, she only has a limited amount of ammo she can hold in T.A.I.L. at once. Also, all darts are created to work on targets with human levels of durability, if they have any sort of enhanced conditoning, then they may not work as well as or even affect said target.

  * 10x Sleeping: these darts neutralize a target, causing them to fall into a deep sleep. From intitial contact, it takes thirty or so seconds before the target falls asleep, assuming that their durablity is proportional to human.

  * 5x Calming: fires a dart with a chemical that causes those hit to calm down. It works much like a seditative, and will take about 15 seconds to work.

 * C.L.A.W. (Contained Luxury Augment Widget) A heavy glove designed around her hand. It allows her access to several, small, utility focused functions. It has a lock pick, a USB for interfacing with computers, a emergency pepper spray for last ditch situations, and a machete.

 * Her costume. She has bought some bullet-proof material, mainly around the chest area, that she has weaved into it.

---

###ATTRIBUTES/FEATS

**Strength:** Peak human 

**Agility:** Her scorpion sense allows her to be knowledgeable about incoming treats/attacks. However, she still has peak human speed, meaning she probably can't dodge everything.


**Intelligence/Wisdom:** 175 IQ. Very knowledgeable about science, with a focus on biochemistry and engineering.


**Defense:** The area of her costume covering her chest is bulletproof.


**Offense:** Non lethal darts, fired at 100 mph. Require skin contact to work.

**[OPTIONAL] Approval Notes:**

Aim to be a 4, maybe a 5 on the power scale."

She has been involved in dining room management.

She's organized events and catering for these events voluntarily to bolster her resume.

She's organized Bodega (winery) events.

She has multiple years of work experience in the individual positions of serving and all of that.

She's finishing up her final coursework, in lieu of an internship she's going to get her work experience validated which will count as she has more than the required one year work experience.

That being said, she's fluent in Spanish and French.  Her English is not quite up there but she's going to work on it.

I guess what I'm asking, is given her background, what would be some options she could have to come to the US near the NJ/NYC area?  She has family she can stay with, should she just start contacting establishments?  I'm sure she needs a sponsor to come legally before she can get a Visa of some sort.

I have her resume that I'm going to help her translate to English which lists all of the positions and roles she's held.

I'll be visiting her this summer, and after that she's looking to try to come hhere. She has a lot of options throughout Spain and France but she wants to try to make it work here.

I'm not even sure if this is the right place, i just don't know anyone in the industry and want to help her do things the right way to maximize her opportunity and avoid problems.

Thank you guys so much for even reading all of this."

The interviewer mentioned that they usually release the offer results some time in May. 

I got a terrible flu during the career fair so once the career fair ended, I flew back home and took care of myself and slept. I was also too miserable to check my emails for a couple days, and the Monday after the fair my recruiter sends me a text message asking if I got the email he sent. I responded immediately informing him that I was too sick to check my emails and he seemed understanding. He asked me to fill out the application as soon as possible and I did just that. 

About a week later, I actually sent an email regarding one of the workshops that Chevron hosted. He never responded to that. I just thought he was too busy from the career fair that maybe he was going to take a minute to get back to me.

Now, it is mid-may and I have heard nothing back from Chevron. I sent another follow up email today and am hoping to get some type of response soon. 

Should I not have any expectations? Is there something else I should do? I would appreciate any responses!"

Onto the watch! This is a 39mm Omega Speedmaster Reverse Panda. It comes with the original Speedmaster bracelet. The watch itself runs fine, I'm unsure of the service history, so it would be sold as is. I do believe this watch is in very good condition, the lume is just barely starting to patina on the indices. All the numbering on the bezel are crisp and the edges are sharp. I took some macro photos, you guys can be the judge. The watch comes with an Omega box and manual, but no paperwork.

I'll be doing an internship this summer in New Jersey making $38/hr. My monthly takehome based on that amount will be $6080. I'm trying to figure out a good budget for the summer, but I'm not sure how much I'll have after taxes hit. 

**Does anyone know how income taxes are calculated for summer internships? I'm originally from California, but I'll be working in New Jersey, so will I have to pay taxes for both states?**

Thanks in advance for the help!"

But I feel that noone is going to even invite me for job interview. I think that I don't meet requirements and every single time I'm going to send my CV I end up anxious with my deppresion getting worse. Most of my time at university I've had depression and I feel like the worst student. I'm worthless and just so afraid. 

What's more if in some miraculous way I get invite for interview I don't know what I will do. Even thinking about it makes me really anxious. I don't know how to break from this. Any advice? "
8jvl3n,41,2018-05-16,How do you get over regret self compassionately?,trynamakeitwerk,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8jvl3n/how_do_you_get_over_regret_self_compassionately/,"I just finished my second year at college. I cried for a week straight after finals because I feel like I didn't prioritize myself these past two years. I've definitely had some good experiences, but my unhappiness boils down to not trying because I was unhappy with myself/life and afraid of failure. 

My most glaring issue is my GPA (3.2, kinda average). But I know I have things going for me. I think I have a good academic direction bc of my majors (econ and comp sci, math minor), and I'll be a research assistant this coming school year. I'll also be on a club eboard. I started going to the gym as soon as I moved back home, so I'm sure it'll be a solid habit once school starts.

This summer, I'm reviewing some classes I didn't do so well in previously, taking a challenging summer class, and studying for and applying for internships starting in August. 

I think I'm off to a good start to get where I want going forward. But despite making a change, I keep feeling bad that I didn't do this to begin with. I find it so so hard to forgive myself and move on because I had a goal but I didn't try for myself. It feels every time I meet someone in college, no matter where they are in life, they have something other than academic achievements that motivates them to care about themselves. I just want to move on and focus on my happiness instead of others'. 

How do I accept that I'm unhappy with my past self while still being self-compassionate?"
8jw2mx,5,2018-05-16,[M/23] Looking for advice on being better in regards to dating and relationships to women.,forget4,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/8jw2mx/m23_looking_for_advice_on_being_better_in_regards/,"I will probably get a lot of hate for this but I've been struggling with this for years now. I'm a 23 year old guy who has never been in a relationship or had sex and I'm graduating college within the week. I have dated a few girls and kissed a few of them but it always falls apart after the first or second date and I end up their back up guy until I figure out what is going on and I walk away from them. I have always given the girls the benefit of the doubt and avoid thinking they are going to make me the back up like the last girl and try to understand why they behave the way they do once it starts. I have always been wrong though and even though my gut would tell me that I should walk away, I don't because I feel like giving them another chance may turn it around.

I have dealt with a lot of manipulation, controlling, jealous girls that have kept me around for attention and wont commit to a relationship with me or keep me as a back up as long as they can but end up with other guys right after. I haven't been on a date in over a year but I have put myself out there through meeting girls, dating apps, etc. The last girl I dated really messed me up and is now with an ex friend of mine and although college is ending I may start seeing her again in a few months when I start my job since we will be working in the same building, not job. Her bf may be there as well. Anyways, everything she was against doing with me she does with him and their relationship has gone so much further than when I was seeing her.

I have been going to therapy for a while now, just started a very low dose of xanax, I have been on and off with working out but plan to start again once finals are over, I have a lot of friends, both guys and girls. Yet I still feel like a failure, worthless, not man enough, and an embarrassment. Just to give a perspective, I have been rated around 7-7.5/10 when I have been rated on reddit by strangers, random strangers have given me compliments on my smile, style, looks from time to time, my friends build me up as a really great guy that is fun to be around and talk to. I even had a few classmates ask me what I was doing on valentines day and when I told them nothing because I was single they were very surprised because they assumed I'm the kind of guy that would easily be with someone. I have had an intern co-worker, who barely knew me, want to try and set me up with her best friend all because she just found out I was single. Other friends and girls have said similar things but they never mention it again and by the time I ask about any updates the girl found someone or they are focusing on school or something.

When others find out that I am single, or have always been single, or still a virgin they think I'm lying. My friends who know about that last girl and my past dating experiences automatically assume the girls were outliers and I just have bad luck meeting girls who are not good people.

Regardless of the compliments or what others think of me, I feel horrible and less about myself because if they do see me that way then why have the girls I have gone on dates with treat me badly, lead me on and go back and forth with me instead of just telling me they aren't interested, and keep getting rejected? I don't really like to drink, clubbing, parties, and similar things don't really interest me and I feel like that all makes me so weird because I don't find that fun like most people my age seem to do. 

The only things I have been told that my problems are, are that I may be too nice and forgiving considering how the girls are able to cancel on me and lie to me and I stick around to give them more chances. Reddit has mentioned that me being a minority, Hispanic, in my area that also looks Indian may hold me back especially online. Other ideas have been that I could be boring but I have gotten a lot of compliments on my social and conversation skills, even from some girls I have dated before. One thing that I believe is that I am not man enough in the sense that I don't give off that real masculine vibe that other guys do. I'm not overly confident but I put myself out there and I feel out of place in social/drinking/party settings where as others thrive. 

All of this has made me think that maybe I'm only cut out to be a girls back up. I even have some very close friends that are girls but they seem to usually come to me for help regarding favors, like rides, picking stuff up for them, etc. They also cross some friend boundaries at times despite them not being into me at all so that also makes me feel like I'm not really seen as someone a girl would want to be with. I don't want to date or do anything with those friends but the comfortableness they, and sometimes other girls, have with me make me think I really am not seen as a man. Two girls even mentioned I'm not the kind of guy girls want until they are in their 40s and want to settle down because thats when they want someone with their life together, not now. I help those friends, and my other friends as well, because that is what I think you should do for friends. Yet I just feel less for it because none of them seem to really want to be there for me when I need help. 

At 23 I will have a degree soon, I have a job lined up, but this all seems pointless because I have never been able to be cared about by a girl. It seems like I'm perceived as less and I believe it and think I should give up on hoping that some girl will ever show up in my life that will actually care about me and vice versa. All those experiences guy and girls have had in life with the opposite sex already makes me feel insignificant because its so common and I haven't had that. All those times I have gone to social events and see that last girl with that guy having the time of their lives together, hearing about how my friends are in relationships, dating, sleeping with other people, getting engaged, getting past their first everything with someone years ago, and I still can't even get past a second date just bothers me so much.

I feel like I always be compared to a girls past boyfriends or partners, that I wont be special in any way, that I will have missed out on the things they already did because no one wanted me before, that if it ever comes up I wont be able to say anything because I have nothing to say, that if a girl does give me a chance she will leave once she realizes no girl has wanted me and will think I have problems, or that I will wake up one day wanting to leave her and resent her because I was never enough for anyone else. Like it all just seems pointless to try putting myself out there again because I missed out on college relationships and fun, I was treated like crap, and girls will only keep doing the same thing others have or reject me.

tldr; Honestly, do guys in their 20s, out of college, who have been treated as back ups, lead on and used for attention, never been in a relationship and still a virgin really matter or should I give up on dating because I'm a red flag at this point since I haven't been able to create a real connection with a girl? I apparently look good on paper based on what friends and strangers say about me, I have a degree (almost), and a good job lined up, but I get treated like a joke by girls and I want to accept I'm not good enough and should just stop trying.

8jw9sk,4,2018-05-16,"Despite experiencing major depression in the past few years, I still feel really excited about the direction my life is going in.",bugseee,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/8jw9sk/despite_experiencing_major_depression_in_the_past/,"Life has recently been a series of major ups and downs for me. I've gone through cycles of relapse and recovery with an eating disorder and experienced depression that has crippled me emotionally for weeks and months at a time. Being a black woman, the political environment of the past few years has been stressful to say the least, and being in my 20s, I'm experiencing a lot of the confusion and stress that comes along with impending adulthood.

However, I feel really lucky because I think that despite all the issues I deal with, I have a positive outlook and am really, really excited about the direction my life is going in. My friends speak kindly of me and I think I'm a generally good person. Whereas my self\-consciousness used to make me feel unattractive and as if I would be single forever, I'm now more confident and feel attractive and I'm comfortable being single.  I've traveled a lot, I've maintained good grades, and I just got hired to the internship of my dreams for the summer!!

I give a lot of credit to the power of attraction, but I also feel like all the hard work I've done in the past few years is paying off and life seems worth it. Although the present can be stressful, I'm excited to see where I end up in the next few years and hope that other people can have the same hope that I do. It's hard to ride out times of pain, but I think that things will turn out okay if we believe they will be. Wishing everybody a beautiful and positive day!"

8jwci8,29,2018-05-16,"Mother stole more than $9,000 from me.",strengtharcana,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8jwci8/mother_stole_more_than_9000_from_me/,"This is a long post, and I apologize for my lack of concision. The first two paragraphs are background that may help contextualize the rest, but isn't required reading to understand everything.

My mother is pretty standard issue narcissist or similar issue. All the classic stuff. Lying about what everybody else said to try to turn you against them (as if my incredibly resilient, non-aggressive little brother would text ""please don't let her evict me"" to the rest of the family to frame her), lying about what you said or how you said it to your face (aka getting in trouble for things I never said or did my entire childhood, and a really bad example of this to come shortly), desperately needing to be the center of attention (berating me for ""only"" spending an hour or two a day with her during my college orientation, thus making her feel like the friends I was making got more attention, then firing me for it from her office I'd helped at since I was a child, then waking me up right before work to ask me to still go in since she was too embarrassed to explain why she fired me to everybody else), a tendency to dole out harsh words (and then make it your fault for being ""too sensitive"" if you react, yet telling you ""you don't care about anyone or anything"" if you stay calm). There's too much shit for me to recount it all without turning this into an even more unapproachably long wall of text, but it's all about money (nobody else is allowed to have an opinion because they are or were financially dependent on her. I'm not, yet I ""owe"" her because I was. Money is central to her abuse of my father, because she makes more than him now, even though he was the only one making money for years so that she could take the risk of starting her own business, and even though he worked for years helping pay her student debt when he had none without ever asking for anything in return.) And it's all about her. (She told my father she's divorcing him the day before his father's funeral because he wouldn't agree that she is a higher priority than the children. He said he loves us all equally, she said that's not how a marriage works, and she has to come first. My younger sister eavesdropped on the whole thing.)  

So with that background, the divorce has been off and on. Now, it's on-on. About a month ago, my mother wanted to drive my sister home 19 hours from college to ""repair their relationship."" Nobody else thought that was a good idea--they had not spoken in four months since she told my sister ""your father and my divorce is your fault,"" which came a few months after my mother tried to cut my sister's phone service while she was studying abroad for refusing to answer her texts. She tells my sister she's not welcome home, and she can't have her car (which is solely in my father's name), and that my father should drop her off at my grandmother's 200 miles away and leave her stranded there. As my father and sister are returning home, she takes the keys to my sister's car and places it to blockade the driveway. My brother takes the spare keys and pulls the car in. She sees it, demands the keys from him, and verbally abuses him when he refuses. Tells him she's going to call the cops to evict him and enacts several other punishments (which she later either denies doing or says were for financial reasons). The police end up at their house twice in twenty four hours. This whole time, I'm off living on my own working a full-time internship 1000 miles away. She calls me trying to get me on her side, telling a story that's very twisted from what everybody else in the family says, trying to make them all sound crazy and horribly mean and leaving out key details.  
I don't love her, and she's been horrible to me. But I also recognize that she cares more about what I think than the others. I've spent a year and a half working full time on decently paid internships as well as high school summers making a small amount, and I'm graduating in one semester; she has less ability to control me with money.  

So, with that in mind, I tried to apply some leverage. I said, gently but very firmly, ""I love you but I have to warn you. If I feel you are fucking with my siblings, you will not hear from me again until your funeral."" I knew she would twist that to be something like ""I'm not speaking to you until your funeral,"" which is a very different idea. A warning vs a declaration. She hung up on me as soon as I said it, so I texted her the exact words ""Let me give it to you in text for the record: If I feel you are fucking with my siblings, you will not hear from me again until your funeral."" I did that so that she couldn't remember what I said differently, as she often does.  
We don't speak for a month. In the mean-time, she's taken to telling people that I threatened her life. I'd recounted the conversation to the rest of my family, and they don't buy it. Money is tight for my family these days. My mother splurges on unnecessary things yet only goes in to work 2-3 days a week now. My father doesn't make much any more. The property tax bill has an installment due. It's not great timing, but there's a couple options. This Monday night, she suggests taking it out of my college fund to my dad, who very firmly refuses. She changes the subject. She doesn't want a divorce. She still loves him. He's firm that it has to happen, but tries to be gentle with her feelings. He tells her he's scared of what being alone is like, too, but it's the best thing for everybody. She says ""I'm not scared. I don't think I'll be alone for long."" They part ways for the night. My dad texts me to warn me about what she was talking about, and I see it in the morning. I check my college funds. She pulled out just under $9,100.  

Let me be clear about what this account is. It's a regular savings account. My parents stopped contributing to my college savings when I was a freshman in college, and their contributions went to a 529 plan. I received two scholarships. One from my university, covering about 3/4 of tuition, deducted straight from tuition, and an outside one covering about a third of what remained. The latter actually paid the money directly to us rather than the school. So, we used 529 money towards tuition until it ran out, and saved the direct scholarship money in that account, since it could be used with less restrictions. I ended up working enough to pay for housing, food, etc, myself and only using it towards tuition. The other money in this account are my last few years of tax returns from my own work, and security deposits I've gotten back from prior apartments (which was my money in the first place.) She has never put a single penny into this account. It's solely money that I've earned via work or scholarship.  

And she took $9,100 of it. The entire outstanding tax bill. What she left me with in my college account is about $5,000 short of my last semester. If she had taken solely the June payment, it would have left me with almost exactly what I needed to graduate. But she took the whole thing without asking permission. And the funny thing? She did it this weekend! Then pretended to have thought of the idea and still be thinking about doing it Monday night.  

I called her ten times before she picked up the phone. She opened with ""Seeing as you wished death on me last time we spoke, I don't see any point to talking... Unless you have something else to say?"" She proceeded to keep attacking me for ""wishing death on her"" and ""sending the cruelest, most mean, grim text I've ever seen,"" and fishing for an apology. I told her I did not wish death on her, and do not wish death on her. I said this is exactly why I sent the text, do you want me to read it to you? She says no, I never want to read such an awful thing again. I tell her I am very angry--she stole my money. She says ""I left your tax return,"" which isn't even true. What she left is less than the last year alone's tax return, and I've spent years working full time for months, sometimes as many as 7 months. (I'm getting my BS in 4.5 years with 6 actual semesters of classes.) I told her she never put a penny into that account, and it's not her money. Her response? It's a joint account with her name on it as well as my father and mine, so she can do anything with it. Obviously, that's true in a legal sense--but that doesn't make it hers. She also claims that having put money into my 529 years ago means she can take back whatever she likes from me without asking from different accounts at any time. She tries to say she's justified doing it after how I treated her, sending such an evil text message to your own mother?! So, I interrupt her and say ""You're not a fucking mother, and I'm done with you. This is goodbye. Formally."" And I hang up.  

I call my father to share what happened with him. She approaches him while I'm on the phone with him and attacks him and attacks me, not realizing I'm still on speakerphone in his pocket. She just talks in circles. It's a financial decision, she's being perfectly reasonable, it's not punitive, and I'm overreacting. Why didn't she just ask first, or just take the June installment? Wow, we're gonna defend the kid who wished death on her? It goes nowhere and makes no sense. The gist is that she feels entitled to that money I earned because she paid for stuff when I was younger. At one point, my dad literally says, ""I don't care if it's legal because you're joint, it's morally wrong."" She replies, ""My lawyer says I didn't do anything wrong."" Fun fact--her divorce lawyer is her high school boyfriend.

I transferred the remaining funds to an account she's not on today where I kept all earnings other than my tax return. We tried, but weren't able to reverse the transaction. Worst case, I can pay the last tuition bill myself with what I've saved up working, but it'll mean I have to successfully get a job lined up before I even graduate if I want some security on paying rent and food for long. My grandmother's offered to help out with the the last tuition bill; I haven't decided whether to accept it yet, but I'm very grateful for her offer. That's not really the point of the post; I have options, will figure it out, and it's not a crisis.  

I'm just still in shock to have learned yesterday morning that in addition to lying about me threatening her life/wishing death on her, my own mother stole nearly $9,100 from my scholarship and earnings. Money she never gave me."
8jwl1d,1,2018-05-16,Procrastination is getting the best of me!,Nero_PR,u_Nero_PR,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Nero_PR/comments/8jwl1d/procrastination_is_getting_the_best_of_me/,"Hi people on Reddit, I'm a 24-year-old guy who has been working on my problems with procrastination and decided to get things out of my chest and maybe help anyone that can relate to this problem. 
I've been to a psychiatric for over 2 years now but the problem is that the medicine is not helping if I don't take the risk of changing myself too. It took all this time for me to understand it and I've been trying to improve my life in some ways.


First: I needed to know what started the process of taking me to procrastinate so much. After too much thought, I get that it all started with my last year in college. I decided to do all at once and embrace the world. It backfired, backfired really bad. I was studying, doing an internship, working 02 jobs (one at my family accounting office and one at the prefecture), doing my term paper and was in the second year of accounting too (was doing last year of laws). You can get the big picture. *IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR ONE PERSON*. I had a mental breakdown.


Second: After knowing my problem I have to find means to improve my life. I was never a tall man (1,71) and not that fit, more like skinny than fit since I wasn't reserving any of my time for the body because in mind it was not ""productive"", but I have good genetics so gaining weight and mass isn't an issue. The problem is that my self-esteem is so low right now that I can't even bother to start the process of working out. 
Since my breakdown, I secluded myself too much and it feels awkward and uncomfortable to go outside sometimes. I can work normally but aside from that when I go out the first thought that crosses my mind is: I want to go home. The times I go out I prefer to go alone so I can enjoy myself: go for a walk, reading at the park, taking the dog for a walk, drinking a bit.  

Don't take much thinking to know that I lost contact with most of my friends from back then. I tried to make some new friends and succeed a few times, but I always walk away from them after some time, I'm just thankful that some then stayed and look for me from time to time.  

The short answer to this is that the people I rely the most on right now are my family, especially my older brother that is bipolar, for this, I'm thankful since we got to get along pretty well lately. The others I can rely on are some friends that I made from a camping experience last year and we get to spend some time occasionally. I started to be more honest and open with all the people around me and it seems that takes a little of the burden away.


Third: Is time to start over but make it step-by-step. This is what I started with this year. I've been following up with a list of things that have been going on my life that I needed to start with or just finished it. It is a type of schedule for myself for each day. It seems childish at first but it helped me a lot so I can keep the focus on what is important and it is important to do it.  

It seems simple but I was losing a lot of opportunities these past 2 years. To name a couple of them: I lost a girlfriend; I lost a chance of getting a better job because I couldn't graduate; I lost a lot of my friends; I made my parents worry when they already have too many things to worry about, especially with my little brother, and the most important thing is I lost a precious amount of time that could be used being productive at working or even helping out someone.


I felt distraught for these past years. I felt lost and depressed like life had no meaning in itself. And it doesn't have because the meaning of life is up to you to give. Hope that my ramblings will be of help to anyone that is needing to find a way to overcome their problems. I'm really thankful for gathering the strength so I can carry on with life itself.


Thank you, Reddit. Especially the people at r/DestinyTheGame. You helped a lot without with knowing it."
8jwpvx,1,2018-05-16,What should I do with school?! I suck at math,Donutsandtacos94,ask,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/8jwpvx/what_should_i_do_with_school_i_suck_at_math/,"So I graduated highschool about 6 years ago (2012) I immediately went into community college but didn’t take many classes, 1 or 2 a semester. Really slow paced. I also switched my major once or twice before settling for CRJ (criminal justice) because it seemed right 

Then I ended up moving from one state to another because I got an internship at a court house, so I switched from a community college to a 4 year online UNI. Still not really close to the finish line but with a decent amount of credits in, I started volunteering at church in the children’s ministry and of course it came natural cause I LOVE working with children. I always said I wanted to run a daycare. 

the internship turned into a full time position and I immediately came to the realization that working in the CRJ field was not my thing. The more I worked with kids and the more I saw them learn off the lessons I prepared the more I felt like this might be my true purpose.

So I switched my major from CRJ to early childhood education. I want to be a teacher and I still have that dream of running my own day care one day my biggest issue with this is that I suck at math. And I don’t want to be the teacher that ruins school for a child because that’s what happened to me.

8jwqw2,3,2018-05-16,Determining my Future,ChemEThrowaway96,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/8jwqw2/determining_my_future/,"Hey guys, I just finished up my Junior year of ChemE and it was the most brutal, life sucking year I have ever dealt with. I grew the most I ever have this year, truly getting involved with our school's SPE chapter, tutoring math, chemistry and java at the university, and being a undergraduate engineering TA. I applied endlessly for internships before my Junior year even started and attended both semester career fairs. I ended up getting 2 interviews, and one wasn't even ChemE related. One emailed me back saying they saw ""great success for my future, but found another candidate with more experience"" \(lol\) and the other never responded back even after my follow up email and attempted phone call. So, I resorted to applying for REUs near the end of the semester. I was able to land a REU in computational chemistry \(I minor in computational math since my school doesn't offer computer science\) and am very excited for the Summer cause I can combine both of my interests!

However, all of my work seems to be leading down doing research and attending graduate school, which is really not something I see myself doing the rest of my life. I'm much more interested in pursuing the industry after my undergraduate degree. I'll hopefully be graduating summa cum laude, but after reading so much through this subreddit and the engineeringstudents subreddit, I still feel I'm going to get fucked trying to get into the industry with not much to show other than academic excellence. I'm quite interested in process control/control systems and was wondering if anyone could give me incite on what I should seriously be doing to land a job in the industry after I graduate. Thanks!"

8jxnux,1,2018-05-16,Student Loan Advice,cloud12348,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8jxnux/student_loan_advice/,"Hey everyone, this will be a long post but I wanted to include all the details to get opinions for my student loans.

Background: Currently on my sophomore/junior co-op (internship) term at my school and looking to where I should be putting my money towards. I make $1186.04 every two weeks and it seems like by the time I am done working I will have made $14825.50.

Private Loans:

Sallie Mae: Principal: $40,812 Interest Rate: 10.625% Variable 1-month Libor Index (It hurts) Interest Accrued: $5,028.23

Wells Fargo: Principal: $22,467 Interest Rate: 10.24% Variable Prime Index (yea) Interest Accrued: $1,091.72

Federal Loans:

A: Principal: $5,500 Interest Rate: 3.760% Interest Accrued: $282.60

B: Principal: $6,500 Interest Rate: 4.450% Interest Accrued: $84.14

Questions:
Okay! After typing all that out I have a few questions that vary from place to place.


Idea: Okay so far I have earned 2 paychecks at my job meaning I have made roughly $2372.08 so far. I'm thinking to completely diregard the federal loans right now because of their better interest rate. My main idea is to start throwing all my earned cash at the sallie mae loan and pay off the ~5-6k interest and made a ~7-8k dent in the principal. 


1.) Is this the right idea to just start paying off the highest interest loan or is it a better idea to throw it at the Wellsfargo loan since there is less accrued interest and more of the money will go towards the principal for the Wellsfargo?


To sum this question up: Plan A: throw all money at sallie mae and nothing else  Plan B: throw all money at WellsFargo and nothing else. Plan C: A mix?


2.) Which of the two indexes is ""safer"" and less likely to rise in your opinion: prime or 1 month libor? I know that my wellsfargo uses prime which only really changes when the federal decides to change and has a lower rate but I wanted to know if the prime rate would cause it to eventually overtake my Sallie Mae loan since the libor rises daily.


3.) I know these loans will capitalize at the end of the 6 month grace period, should I still throw all my money at the highest interest and let the lower interest rate loans capitalize? I wasn't sure if I should pay down the interest on them all or just throw my money at the highest interest loan. My logic was that it would be like transferring my loans from a higher interest to a lower interest by letting the lower interest ones capitalize.


4.) My parents claim was that my bad interest rates were due to their mistakes in the past but according to my dad lately, he says his score is actually high surprisingly. Was this due to something other than his credit score?


5.) Can a cosigner ever hurt your interest rates?


6.) Am I able to refinance any of these loans before I graduate? I know many require graduation but I wanted to ask anyway since I'm working at the internship.


7.) Is there any way to lower these interest rates  (like a fixed rate) or am I pretty much out of luck until I graduate?


I really appreciate all of your help and I'm trying my best to stay ontop of this to save myself as much money as possible.

I manage a pretty hefty load of \(mostly\) Traffic Optimized Ads Manager Campaigns for clients at my company.

8jyzva,0,2018-05-16,23 year-old controls engineer; salary and how to determine what I'm worth,FinancialQuestion2,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8jyzva/23_yearold_controls_engineer_salary_and_how_to/,"Hello, PF! Throwaway account due to simple anonymity and security concerns.

I'm a recent graduate from a small university in the US with a BS, robotics and embedded systems. Experience in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, programming, circuit and logic design, as well as the melding of all above fields into 'robotics' in order to be involved in a project's process from design to implementation.

I moved to south-west Missouri in order to be closer to family and to finish up my last semester of university online while also completing a required internship for graduation in the IT department of a large multinational corporation's headquarters. In the next town over a branch of the same company does the in-house R&amp;D for all of the partners and subsidiaries of the corporation, and I applied for a position as a controls engineer in March 2017.

A number of interviews later I was given an offer letter for my desired position; all was great, it seemed like a good salary, and it was an occupation and company I wanted to really get into.

Now after over a year of employment in the same position, I feel like the level and complexity of the work I'm doing doesn't merit the salary I originally negotiated. I started at $50,000/year, and between May 2017 and January 2018 moved up 2% to $51,000. I work on control and human interface code for industrial machines ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 retail, and do everything from existing product support to new system/product development from scratch. The company bills my group's time at $65/hr to subsidiary companies that decide to use us, with an average billable time of 70% out of all work hours. I've also traveled numerous times in the last 12 months to large trade shows to both demonstrate and support offerings at those shows as well as done installations of machines at large corporations.

The problem is that I don't know any of my co-worker's salaries, and don't know if breaching the topic is uncouth or frowned upon in such an environment. I was warned that salaries for the area are ""about 10% lower"" than other similar positions around the country when negotiating, but the current discrepancy feels much larger than that. The benefits are very good and should be contributed as $5,000-$10,000 on their own, along with retirement and stock plans.

Should I be pushing for a higher salary now that I've become familiar with the company's systems and a very necessary part of the group? I've only gained one year of experience but training a new hire on the current workings of what we offer would require months, and the current workload would become crushing if any member of the group were to leave.

That being said, relocation really isn't an option for me. I love the area, being around family, and actually very much enjoy my workplace. I just feel that compared to other recent graduates with the same experience levels in my field that my salary isn't reflecting the work that I'm putting in, but I have no current foundation on which to lay that basis.

Given the information above, how should I determine my worth to the company and negotiate a relatable salary?

What are your thoughts, PersonalFinance?"
8jzfgv,6,2018-05-16,"Offered internship, was expecting employment. How should I be navigating these post graduate/pre-professional waters without selling myself short?",Leia_Sillywalker,LandscapeArchitecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/LandscapeArchitecture/comments/8jzfgv/offered_internship_was_expecting_employment_how/,"Update: Professor offered me a 2 month intern/traineeship which would likely be followed by employment if all goes well. That should be enough time for us both to decide if it is a good fit. The rate and hours available are less than I was anticipating, but will be revisited after 2 months. I’m generally keeping my options open but am hoping employment and a competitive rate will come soon!

At the beginning of my final semester in my MLA program, one of my professors offered me a Spring internship with his local firm, which I accepted. Unfortunately, we each became too busy and the internship wasn’t revisited until the past couple days. Now that I am a graduate, in the top of my class and with several national awards and additional certification in GIS, I am wondering if accepting an internship is selling myself short, and should be pushing for an entry level position instead.

While I don’t actually have any internship experience in an office, I’ve had two studios and a Maymester with this professor and I would assume he is aware of my skillset, worth ethic and professionalism. I know several classmates that were hired without internships in other firms, so I’m wondering what the hold up is. However, his team is made up of graduates from my program, so I have been hopeful.

I won’t have an in depth conversation with him until this evening about potential for employment after the internship is completed (or how long it will be, or the pay), which I hope will clarify things, but my husband is concerned that I’m being taken advantage of. He thinks my professor is taking advantage of graduates who are eager to start working asap...which I am, haha. I don’t necessarily agree, but I’m trying to be mindful of this. 

This professor has been difficult to communicate with for the past few months, but because I respect his overall professionalism, process and the quality of work he and his small team do, I’ve been holding out for this opportunity. I turned down a few other internships (which wouldn’t have worked out anyway because of how busy my schedule became) and kind of put all my eggs in his basket. I guess hearing him say “internship” on the phone burst my bubble - I was hoping for immediate employment, which I already told him in an email and will push in my next conversation.

I can certainly start applying to other firms for entry level positions, but I really wanted to work with him. My friends’ input is a little more forgiving of this professor’s lack of communication as they know how busy he is, but are pushing me to not undercut my worth, while my husband is skeptical. I’m still optimistic, but want to hear other’s thoughts on this situation.

Tl;dr My professor offered me a Spring internship which hasn’t materialized until recently, after graduation. Communication with him during the semester was poor and I articulated I’m more interested in a job after graduating, but he still only spoke of an internship in our most recent conversation. My resume is competitive and I’m worried about selling myself short by starting at an internship hourly rate. I will be speaking with him soon to hash out details, but wanted to hear others’ thoughts.

8k01vl,1,2018-05-16,Is it possible to get a visa in the UK as a US citizen while I'm there?,pigstakeflight,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/8k01vl/is_it_possible_to_get_a_visa_in_the_uk_as_a_us/,"I'm in a bit of a predicament. 

I'm a US citizen and college student. I will be spending my whole summer in the UK.. which is from what I understand, perfectly fine on just your passport alone. I will also be taking a short course at a university, but they also said that I don't need a visa... so that's all golden.

The issue is that I may potentially be getting an internship.. and the further issue is that I am leaving in exactly two weeks... So if I get hired.. which would be in about a week.. I won't have any time to get a visa.. and I won't be able to intern because this is a corporate company and it is illegal in the UK to have unpaid interns. And i can't apply for a visa without already having a sponsor.

Now, please do correct me if any of this is incorrect. I've done all of my research myself and nobody seems to have a straight answer for me. Even my university (which is a *very* good school and *should* be able to handle this) does not have a department that handles students and their immigration paperwork when they go abroad! They only handle incoming international students! What the heck!

Additionally... I would *like* to have the opportunity to make money while I'm there.. is there any sort of visa or pass or *something* that would allow me to take a retail job even?

So. If I do get the internship, is there *any* way that I could receive the visa while I am in the UK? Or is it an absolute, unwavering rule that I must be in the US to receive it as it is really just for customs to stamp in my passport....

Thank you."

I have always suffered from anxiety and depression as they run in my family. I was raped in 2012, and am recently coming to terms with the fact that I was sexually assaulted and emotionally abused by an ex.

My self-harming began in elementary school. I can remember purposely making myself throw up, banging my head, intentionally bruising, and cutting myself with scissors. The earliest I can remember doing this was around 7. 

I haven't been self-harming for the past few years. I have basically stopped cutting and burning, but still do bruise intentionally as I am having a very hard time letting thwt behaviour go. My last suicide attempt was in highschool. However, I am finding that with treatment and finally confronting what I went through, the urge is way too strong to resist. I had my worst episode since highschool after getting triggered at work from a coworker who looks exactly like my ex, as well as a manager who has sexually harassed me being present. I went home and burned myself, something I haven't done since highschool. It is very noticeable, and I am doing my best to cover it up, but I know that it is going to scar. I start an internship in the fall, and am scared that they won't have healed enough by then.

I am in a relationship with someone who has also struggled with self-harm. It is making me extremely anxious that she is going to see what really happened and be triggered. I love her very much and the thought of setting back any progress in her treatment makes me feel horrible, I never want to do that.

I feel like a broken person. I don't even know what the point of writing this is. Every time I am alone I have such a hard time pushing out all of the suicidal thoughts, urges to self-harm, paranoia, and spiralling due to anxiety. It's like I literally can't be alone anymore, everything hurts."

Turned 18 recently, senior in high school. I have about a week of school left, and then I'm going to Rice, as I got recruited for baseball. I got my trust fund, which contains $3 million. I could theoretically live off that my entire life, but fuck that, I've got plans. My idols are Howard Hughes (sans crazy) and Elon Musk, and I want to be as rich and influential as them. I've taken multiple IQ tests at school, and I've gotten as low as 135 and as high as 156. I consider myself a bit of a renaissance man. My areas of expertise are:

- CS. I'm self-taught in Python and Java. Last summer, I did a research internship with a local professor in which I helped with machine learning research. I hoped to be able to write my own academic paper, which didn't happen. Nevertheless, it was a fascinating experience, and I got a good rec letter out of it. 

- Filmmaking. I've written, produced, directed, and acted in a couple short films. The first one I made at 14 is admittedly terrible, but the most recent one has been shown at a couple film festivals. I also wrote a feature-length script, which was a finalist or semifinalist at a couple competitions.

- Athletics: My dad is an excellent athlete, and so he pushes me to be athletic. I have, throughout my short life, played soccer, basketball, tennis, golf, and done boxing on a whim. However, as I have mentioned, m my favorite sport is baseball. I discovered it in the 8th grade, fairly late, but have played varsity all of high school. I'm first baseman, but my talent has always been hitting.

- Debate. I'm also Captain of my school's debate team, and we have qualified nationally twice. 

- Chess. I've won state-level tournaments. My favorite opening would be Stonewall for white, King's Indian for black. 

- Photography. I prefer mirrorless, but like expirementing with Polaroid and other vintage cameras.

- Flying. I've been taking lessons since I was 15 and have gotten my license. I love learning the engineering behind it just as much as flying itself.

- Politics. I have mostly liberal views, but honestly think most Americans are too stupid to know what to vote for. I advocate for trickle-up economics, universal basic income, and gun control. 

I think it's fair to say I'm productive. I feel that kind of started in 7th grade. I was really shy then and mostly just played on my phone instead of socializing or doing anything productive. However, I had this huge crush on this girl. It didn't work out for a couple reasons: 1) ideological beliefs. She's GOP, I would consider myself a Democrat. She's Catholic, I'm what TV Tropes calls a Straw Nihilst. 2) I was, as I mentioned, shy and awkward. I was also pretty ugly, since I wore the same thing everyday and had a really unflattering haircut. She inevitably rejected me. I was pretty depressed and so threw myself into all my hobbies. It kind of became a habit. Since then, I've only dated one girl, and it's only because everyone told me to. It was dreadfully boring, so I dumped her. Now and then, my girl friends tell me that such and such thinks I'm cute, but I really have better stuff to do.

**Plans for the future:**  I have an idea for an app which I want to develop. I want to continue making movies. I'm planning to use my trust fund for both these endeavors. I'm playing baseball and intend to also debate. I may get involved in politics later on.

8k0h7w,2,2018-05-16,Housing Budget While in College,Ab-Eb-Bb-C-Eb-G-C,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8k0h7w/housing_budget_while_in_college/,"Hey all, thanks for taking the time to read this. 

So I know the conventional wisdom is that the housing line for budgets should be around ~&lt;30% with wiggle room as high as 35% or 40%. I don't think I've seen anything on this subreddit that suggests going higher than 40% since it starts eating into money that can be used for savings/investments. 

During this next upcoming school year, my rent is going to be about $360/month plus another ~$50/month for utilities. Total about $410/month which is pretty cheap for the area of Pittsburgh I'm living in (close to campus, and I am already splitting my room with someone which is why it is 300-400 cheaper than normal). 

Based on my calculations, that means that in order to hit that bare minimum of 30%, my monthly income would have to be $1,366. For 40% it is 1,025. 

This seems really high for someone that is in college. I'll be in my 4th year (last year) and will be graduating soon, and in addition after this summer's internship I'll have more than enough saved up for a 4-6 month emergency fund.

At college I have two jobs already, one for the university that pays maybe $20-50/week and a waiter job at a restaurant that can net me around $150/week. That means a monthly income of about $800/month MAX. That means that living expenses would comprimse over 50% of my monthly income, and that's assuming I work a fair decent bit during the week which may not be doable with school work. If I have to pass on shifts at the restaurant, I could see living expenses going upwards as high as 60% or 70% of monthly income. I'm still making enough to pay rent, car insurance, and save a little, but its substantially higher than what is suggested in this sub. 

My question is whether or not this is okay/expected/normal for college students to experience. While I already signed the lease and can't back out of it now, I'm wondering how much I should be expecting to work in conjunction with taking classes my final year. The way I see it, I don't really have to worry about investing yet since the amount would be so negligible compared to when I graduate (studying Chemical Engineering, should be able to net a job with at least $65-75k/year). That means I should be able to justify a greater proportion of my income going to rent/utilities compared to someone with a 401k, IRA, and other expenses. Is this logic sound, or should I still be abiding by the 30% guideline?

Thanks in advance for taking some time to read this!

TL;DR: It's hard to take classes and work while in college. Since I can only make so much money waiting on tables, housing costs will eat up way more than 30% of my monthly income. Is this okay?"

How can i approach big 4 / mid-tier internship recruitment that is coming up in Fall? if it helps, I did a high school student coop for 6 months in PwC in their audit teams, and almost 4 months in EY in their tax team before I went to the military but that was almost 3-5 years ago.

My mom would call me a liar when I said that my friend's parents cook delicious dinners because she thought that her cooking was the best even though she barely cooked dinner. I would always eat frozen pre-made food such as chicken nuggets or canned soup and whenever I complained, my mom would tell me that all families eat frozen food even though I see my friend's parents cook freshly made meals all the time. I remember one time when I got hit by a car, my mom laughed at me because I didn't get injured enough. I never had a good relationship with mother at all when I was younger, in fact, I barely knew her for 11 years of life until my sophomore year of high school is when she started talking to me. I can rant about all the narcissistic things my parents do, but I was wondering how do you all deal with the emotional scars and burdens that you faced because of your parent's abuse? I am having a really hard time doing well in school, concentrating in class, and just enjoying life. My social life is shit as I am having a hard time trying to make friends at school because I feel that everyone is out to hurt me. I've never asked a girl out or dated at all because I felt that I needed time to take care of myself. Everyone thinks I am weird as I always score lower than average on the midterms and that I seem to always look depressed. It sucks when I see all my classmates getting internships, girls, good grades, and partying while I just study, go back to my apartment, smoke some weed, and play video games or watch movies in my free time. I have no clue how to handle my emotions or come to terms that this is who I am since I constantly compare myself to my classmates. If you have any advice, I would like to hear it as I have no clue where to start. "
8k0nsm,2,2018-05-16,Freelancing remotely in the US while spending time outside of the country?,pigstakeflight,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/8k0nsm/freelancing_remotely_in_the_us_while_spending/,"My plans for the summer have taken an unfortunate turn. I am a US citizen and college student and will be spending the summer in the UK only as a tourist as I was unable to secure an internship in time. I will be leaving in two weeks. 

So of course, I have no way to make money while I'm there.. fortunately I have some saved up and I will be living with my boyfriend who is a UK citizen for the time that I am there. 

I do freelance graphic design work on the side, and I am wondering if that is a viable option for making money while I am in the UK. Since freelancing is often done remotely, is it legal for me to accept US based jobs, and complete them on my computer while I am away? The payment would go into my bank account in the US.. and I would potentially exchange the money that I make through the bank..... or not as I said I have already saved up money.. I could spend the money that I have saved, and use the freelance work to replenish my bank account for when I return.

Is this legal?"
8k0t1g,24,2018-05-16,Grieving the small pieces,GalvanicCouple,SuicideBereavement,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideBereavement/comments/8k0t1g/grieving_the_small_pieces/,"In February, my ex-fiancé (we will call O) committed suicide and I would like to just talk about it because today grief crashed against me like a tidal wave. 

In 2013 I met O and we began dating. He was my best friend and I loved him deeply. Starting in 2014 I noticed his drinking escalating to beyond just socially. Knowing that several of his family members suffered from alcoholism, I tried to push him toward sober activities (I don’t drink much myself), but it didn’t work. One night, while very drunk, he hit me. I know that I should have left right then, but I didn’t because I loved him and I thought he would change. He attended therapy off and on after this event. He was diagnosed with depression and went on medication. I thought things would get better, but he began drinking again. The drinking and depression fed each other. In 2015, it got the worst it had ever been, and O said, “if you ever leave me, I’ll just kill myself.”

Looking back, I know this relationship was emotionally abusive. Alcoholic O was not the man I met nor the man I fell in love with. In 2016, I took and internship several states away for three months. During this time, the drinking again hit a peak. O began using drugs and I found messages to other women he was sending. When I got back we broke up and I asked him not to contact me unless he went to AA and got the help he needed. By this point my anxiety was overwhelming. I couldn’t fix the love of my life and I was pulling myself down trying to save him, so I let go. 

I took a full time job several states away and wanted to start over. O contacted me several times wanting to get back together, but I held firm. I moved out of our house, I deleted him from social media. 2017 was a good year for me. I excelled at work, I made new friends, I found a new boyfriend who really meshed well with my values and beliefs, I got my anxiety to a manageable point. I checked in on via a mutual friend and he was going to AA, exercising and trying to get a promotion at work, he seemed okay. 

In February of 2018, I got a call from O’s Mom that he had shot himself in the head. I felt like as she was talking, I was listening from underwater. I went home for the funeral. It couldn’t be real. I touched him in the casket. I watched him be buried. And I was mad the whole time. What an asshole to do this to his siblings and and parents and his friends. 

After the funeral, I read the note he left and it just wasn’t O. He was so drunk it didn’t even make sense. He was alone and scared. Now I’m mad and I feel guilty. This was my fault for not staying with him. My fault for not fixing him. But, I know now it’s not my fault for anything. He was sick and I couldn’t save him, it wasn’t my job. 

I went to therapy for 2 months. But now, I still hear a song or open my jewelry box and see my old engagement ring and my breath catches for just a minute. For a split second I feel guilty for moving on and being happy. But I know I can’t and I know that wherever O is now, he is back to his sober self and he wouldn’t want me to be miserable. 

I just hope he knows that when I die old and happy, my first business in the afterlife is going to be punching him in the face and then giving him a hug. 

Throughout this whole process my new boyfriend has been very supportive, but I feel awkward grieving around him. Is it normal to grieve a past lover after you’ve moved on? I have just been working through the feelings as they come up, but I try not to talk to BF about them much. "

8k0vvx,0,2018-05-16,So tired of the Meredith/ Ellen/Krista bashing!,sv092789,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/8k0vvx/so_tired_of_the_meredith_ellenkrista_bashing/,"I love Greys and I have loved  it for years. It is my “comfort food”of  a show.

I do not understand the vile hatred of the Japril, Kepzona etc  fans for Ellen and Krista.

April and Arizona were secondary characters from the beginning.  The show started out  about Meredith dealing with being an intern, her love life, her friends and her mom. All the other characters  did evolve and  became part of a central story but  the show has always brought it back to Meredith. 

Ellen  has fought for years to have the show be about more than just her and McDreamy.  I loved and still do love MerDer, but I agree with the killing him. It gave Meredith more of a story she didn’t get happily ever after and she had to figure out how to be on her own. 

Also Patrick Dempsey by all accounts was an ass.

Just because Ellen and Krista aren’t posting selfies with the cast and crying about how much they are going to miss Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw doesn’t make them a villain anymore than  SD and JC posting selfies and constantly  pandering to THEIR fans trying to paint themselves as some horribly done by angels. They got let go it happens they were not part of the central story. 

I could go on about Japril being a toxic couple who quite honestly couldn’t have made it. They were too different.  Jackson treats her like a child and she acts like one with him. The only time she is the bad ass trauma surgeon is when she is NOT with him. When she is whining or crying over Jackson or following him around like a puppy dog she is pathetic. She is the stage five clinger that guys worry about when they sleep with Virgins.


Also did everyone forget how Arizona cheated on Callie? Left her to go to Africa? Waited until she was finally ok than came back? Didn’t want kids than decided to take Mark and Callies kid away from Callie?  Blamed Karev and Callie for losing her leg? Why are we hoping for Calzona endgame. I think Callie has been through enough. I wish she had stayed and Arizona had taken off with Penny. I think Callie and Carina would have been an awesome couple.

Arizona and April  not great Characters.  They served their purpose.

Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew, have been baiting their fans for attention and its worked you all have been so quick to get Angry at Ellen and Krista, but they are trying to tell a story about strong women. If you don’t like it or don’t like how its told than  just stop watching hating on them and constantly whining about it isn’t going to change anything.

I for one would rather see stories about Meredith, her kids, her sisters, bailey and Webber and Alex and Jo. 

If all you are looking for in a show is relationships and supercouples there is always young and the restless. "

8k1lyc,52,2018-05-17,How do deal with aging parents [60+M&amp;F] as an only child?,throwaway19377813373,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8k1lyc/how_do_deal_with_aging_parents_60mf_as_an_only/,"My parents had me late in their lives. I’m 21, they’re in their early sixties. I’m their only child. 

Lately, they’ve been having a lot of medical issues. There are 4 surgeries between the two of them scheduled for the next month. I’ve been away at college and I will be away all summer for an internship. Every few days, my mother will text me a several paragraph long text detailing the medical issues of the day. It’s a lot to keep up with, especially with school and maintaining a social life. (My mother doesn’t sleep much, so I get these texts at 10-12pm, usually when I’m out with friends or going to bed, so I’m distracted.) 

I feel like shit because I can’t keep up with everything. Every day is another phone call to one of their 10+ doctors. I try my best to be supportive, but when every day I’m at home involves an hour long dissertation on the most recent medical problem, I get frustrated. I know it’s selfish as hell, but I can’t help but feel jealous of my friends who don’t have to deal with this and, even if they do, they have siblings to take some of the burden. 

I’ve been home for a few weeks and I just can’t help but look forward to moving for my internship. But then I feel guilty for not staying and help them with their surgeries? But on the other hand, I need to live my life and this internship was a dream come true. 

How do you deal with balancing family illness and living your life? I plan to move pretty far away after college, but I know I’ll feel guilty leaving them alone with their myriad of issues. It’s hard because this sort of thing ~should~ be happening when I’m older and established in my career, not just starting out 

It should also be noted that I definitely have had a strained relationship with my mother in the past and this is certainly worsening it. I’d bet my life savings she has an undiagnosed case of OCD and anxiety and as you can imagine, this whole situation isn’t really helping her anxiety. 

tl;dr parents have been pretty sick, trying to balance helping them and doing what I need to do to further my career.

8k2pnj,5,2018-05-17,"Two separate days of fasting, impressions from a beginner.",[deleted],fasting,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/8k2pnj/two_separate_days_of_fasting_impressions_from_a/,"Hello ya’ll,

On Tuesday morning I woke up late for my internship so I had no time to eat breakfast or pack any lunch. I told myself that I’ll just delay my hunger until lunch. At lunch I realized that I was hungry, but I wasn’t that hungry. I realized that I could probably delay my hunger further so I did, until around 7pm, 22 hours since my last meal *\(late dinner on Monday\)*. At 7 I felt no hunger but had a small bowl of peanuts and a drink, an hour later I ate my first and only meal for the day.

I decided to repeat the process on Wednesday following a roughly similar schedule. Here are my impressions from a complete beginner who hasn’t fasted before other than usually skipping breakfast and having my first meal around noon:

* I probably doubled my water consumption these two days, only drinking regular water, sparkling water and green tea.
* I don’t think my stomach ever screamed for food, but I felt hungry on multiple occasions. Said hunger was easily suppressed with water and sugar free gum.
* Social stigma.
   * *‘’you’re not gonna eat?*
   * *‘’what, is it something religious?’’*
   * *‘’fasting like that is bad for you, when you actually start eating you’re body will absorb more fat and you’ll gain more weight’’*
   * *‘’omg K1tty\_Purry you won’t be able to work efficiently if you don’t eat’’*
   * *‘’why u do dis?’’*

* Most of my colleagues would jokingly tease and mock me, but if I decided to skip dinner all together, my partner would probably call my mother and she along with half of my extended family would come over and force feed me and scorn me at my stupidity \(*if you’ve ever seen my my big fat greek wedding*, my family is sort of like that\). I could stand to lose maybe 5\-10 pounds of fat at the most, but food is just so prevalent and ingrained in our western culture and society that it's hard just to maintain my current weight.\* \*\*\*
* I wasn’t hungry during the evenings when I had my small snack and later, my first meal for the day. My meal size wasn’t bigger than when I ate 2\-3 times per day with multiple snacks, yet I felt slightly bloated after eating, like I had eaten too much despite not eating anything that day. Is this common?
* Hunger was easy to combat, but dear god does the taste of good food and peer pressure make it hard. When colleagues are getting ice cream when it’s 80℉ outside at break I can’t have any, my partner, mother and sister are all either fantastic chefs or bakers. It’s really hard to resist a freshly baked cinnamon roll or cooked meal. I don’t want to eat because I’m hungry, I want to eat because it tastes delicious. Seriously this was \(is\) the hardest thing to combat and it’ll get even harder if I decide to maybe do a 36 hour fast.
* Saving time and money. Eating takes a lot of time and it’s the small purchases that add up. A sandwich in the morning, lunch at work, a snack during the afternoon.
* I didn’t feel any noticeable difference in my mood, strength, stamina, alertness etc than when I ate regularly. Maybe I need to go over 24 hours before I notice any impact.

I mostly did this because I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could. It was surprisingly easy to keep my hunger at bay, but the social stigma and the taste of food was incredibly hard to fight, I wanted to eat because I knew that it would taste amazing. This is a subject I’m actually not that familiar with so I can’t really argue back when people say its bad for me. I believe that the pro’s outweigh the con’s, but I’m actually not that certain and no one at home would take the time to sit with me and actually read a paper or watch a documentary on fasting so I’m not sure how to reach through to them.

I hope writing this was okay, but I just wanted to share my impressions with someone that will actually listen since I can’t talk about this at home. Tips on my big culprits are appreciated."

I'm +18 year old in real life and I'm seeking an fantasy with a equally +18 year old in real life roleplayer

 I'm more inclined to accept first the ones submitting their own suggestions rather than leaving me to pick everything, if you read the prompts you will realize I am flexible and open to all sort of things so please don't feel shy of pitching your idea. A bonus if it is something related to r/impregPersonals or if you would love to corrupt/tease 

I'm equally available to chat and have a good time instead of role-playing 

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the boys had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. In fact, this boy is yet to empty his balls and for a (weeks/months/years) he had been stroking his cock stimulating his semen to be produced but unable to release to his congenital problem where he cannot cum unless he has accumulated a (weeks/months/year) worth of thick creamy fertile sperm load. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that the intern was only (+18??) years old.

Who would like to play as her? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left aim charge of a few errands because as your parents have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**edging stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. You started to grow up to (?age), paying more attention to the opposite, boys started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way you saw her dad...which, after all, is everything you can wish for in a man of your own... Without realizing you started to imagine him touching you....kissing you...and even taking you on his bed...such as every night or so you hears your mum moan as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes you a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, your mum (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. You are at home waiting to have your man(dad) around to try something more than just imagining....today you are willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent young adult girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) Summer vacations and you invited 2 of your best friends. During the night sleepover you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them  and there is no internet available, some of your friends are more experienced but still doesn't quite satisfy you, also no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just not slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** (none are deal breakers) are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks) coupled with thick girls, being corrupted/mind broken, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.


Suggestions for *how you might look*: r/tinytits or r/slightcellulite r/ThickThighs/
*Things I would would like to see* r/girlsinyogapants r/seethroughleggings r/visiblepantyline r/cameltoe 


remaining kinks: https://i.imgur.com/734mF8q.png 
Also it would be great if you can stick to describing things rather than just using pictures (both are welcome).


I'm flexible in terms of age and I'm equally open to brainstorm/adjust this or other scenarios so feel free to message me your idea for a good naughty RP :).

8k47tt,47,2018-05-17,"Gold and Wars, Calculated",darchangels13,ClashRoyale,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/8k47tt/gold_and_wars_calculated/,"**EDIT** I am getting feedback that suggests my Level numbers are low for clans with high participation. These levels reflect aprozimately 23 active warriros I will have to update later tonight, with more detail to accurately reflect partial vs full participation.

**NOTE:** Any time card levels are mentioned please assume I am referring to common card ps unless explicitly mentioned, and I will generalize levels to common equivalent. I.E. Legendary 5 = Epic 8 = Rare 11 = Common 13 will all be collectively referred to as L13 unless a rarity is explicitly mentioned

# Intro

Okay so there's a lot of complaints right now about the cost of upgrading cards for war. I mean look how much it costs to upgrade to L13! I HAVE TO DO THAT 83 TIMES?

No.  You don't!

First ask yourself ""What League Is my Clan in?"" Legendary League is a long way off for even top tier e\-sports  clans with dedicated interns whose only job is to hammer the War button as soon as the previous one ends.  Speaking of interns, poor Timmy got fired last week for being 3 seconds too late in the middle of a Thunderstorm while his grandma was in the hospital.  TREAT YOUR INTERNS BETTER.

Then compare to the following chart **\(I'm only in Silver, if anyone in Gold League can confirm the typical levels there I'd appreciate it\)**

|League|Typical Levels|
|:-|:-|
|BRONZE|7\-10|
|SILVER|9\-10|
|GOLD|10\-11\(?\)|
|LEGENDARY|1\`1\(?\)|

## Okay so?

First thing to note is that Bronze League is basically played at or below tournament standard.  Typically only legendary cards are above Standard in Bronze, because you only need to find 2 copies. Sometimes an epic hits 5, or a rare L8, but for the most part, it is tournament standard.

Second thing to note is that in Silver League, it only goes up a little.  You quit playing with under\-Standard cards, but mainly because you find enough to rank them up.  But you aren't suddenly competing with L10 and 11 cards, you'll find L10 cards much more common but basically won't have any 11s.

Why? The collection day literally doubled! But card levels increase at a basically exponential rate.  This means that 2x collection cards really only lets you add one level, and since you probably had holes to fill in, the mathematical expectation is that you get less than one level, because you'll also fill in holes with some of those cards.

Third thing to note is that gold league and titan league do not double collection cards. This means that war decks at this level will add less than one level to the decks you were using in Silver.  You'll unlock more cards, and their levels will be more consistently at 10, with some creeping into the 11s.

## So what does that mean for gold?

It means that the majority of players will need L9 cards to compete in Bronze League and L10 cards to compete in Silver, but not really much more than that, even if they reach Gold or Legendary.  

# What does that actually cost?

Now that's the 100,000 gold question isn't it?  So to level up a here's a list of the level upgrade costs for a specific level.

[Source](https://clashroyalearena.com/guides/card-upgrade-costs)

|Level|Common|Rare|Epic|Legendary|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|0|\-|\-|\-|
|2|5|\-|\-|\-|
|3|20|0|\-|\-|
|4|50|50|\-|\-|
|5|150|150|\-|\-|
|6|400|400|0|\-|
|7|1,000|1,000|400|\-|
|8|2,000|2,000|2,000|\-|
|9|4,000|4,000|4,000|0|
|10|8,000|8,000|8,000|5,000|
|11|20,000|20,000|20,0000|20,000|

So to compete with a card we have *never* upgraded \(starting at L1\) here's what we need to spend

|League|Level Needed|Total\-Cost \(Common\)|Total\-Cost \(Rare\)|Total\-Cost \(Epic\)|Total\-Cost \(Legen....dary\)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|BRONZE|9|7,625|7,600|6,400|0|
|BRONZE/SILVER|10|15,625|15,600|14,400|5,000|
|SILVER/GOLD/LEGENDARY|11|35,625|35,600|34,400|25,000|

Let's say you've never upgraded anything.   Be honest, you have, at least that one Knight in the tutorial.  But if we assume you haven't then total cost to upgrade for a brand new player is:

|Rarity|Number of Unlock\-able Cards|Total Cost\(BRONZE\-9\)|Total Cost \(BRONZE/SILVER\-10\)|Total Cost \(SILVER/GOLD/LEGENDARY\)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Common|23|175,375|359,375|819,375|
|Rare|23|174,800|358,800|818,800|
|Epic|24|153,600|345,600|825,600|
|Legendary |14|0|70,000|350,000|
|ALL Rarities|84|503,775|1,133,775|2,813,775|

# Takeaways

The total cost isn't that insane to be competitive in BRONZE.  A player who has maxed a single deck has spent a bare minimum 1,400,000 gold on it, which is still **more** expensive that it would cost to get every single card in the game \(including Rascals!\) into the range to play in Silver and low\-level Gold leagues *starting from 0*.  

Competing in the higher tiers of GOLD and LEGENDARY Leagues will get very expensive, costing nearly **3x** as much as it costs to compete in SILVER and **6x** as much as it costs to compete in Bronze.

Assuming you start in Legendary Arena with **zero gold,** and are collecting 500 gold per day in donations, 100 gold per day in victory gold, and opening 3 free chests, 4 silver chests, 1 gold chest, and 1 crown chest, while also warring and earning 125/day in BRONZE league victory gold \(that's 300\+200 for victory gold, across 2 days, at a 50&amp;#37; win rate\)

500\+100\+\(3\* 105\)\+\(4\*84\)\+264\+660\+125 = 2,300 

It will take you 219 days to grind every single card in the game from L1 to L9.  Note my numbers don't include any special chests \(not even Giant/Magical\), nor challenges \(not even ones with bonus prizes\), nor quest rewards, it assumes you have no gold income from maxed stacks, and never earn a Draft chest from Ladder. It also assumes you're playing at least 7 matches per day to earn chests and war and deliberately undervalues ladder victory gold \(mostly to make it a nice round number\)

This means it's quite possible to have a *much* better gold earning rate than this.  Maximum gold from donations per day is actually 1,300 \(on days that aren't Sunday\), nearly 3x my assumed rate, and adds 800 right there.

At the same gold earning rate it will take you 493 days to grind every single card from Level 1 to Level 10 

# Conclusions

At first glance the gold required seems intimidating, but in truth even if you started **at 0** \(and you're not\) it would take about 7 months of play to get *every* single card to BRONZE grade playable, and about 15 months to get them to SILVER league earning a fairly conservative gold income.  The cost to max a single deck is more than it costs to play competitively in SILVER league \(and those levels will be low, but still workable in GOLD league\)

At the same time it is also quite expensive, so most players will be forced to choose whether they really want to spend the 800,000 gold, to take their deck from L12 to L13, or if they instead want to use that gold to make *every card in the game* playable in wars."

8k5bc2,51,2018-05-17,VR/Exeter Ransacker: early parts of the MO plus guns,Nora_Oie,EARONS,https://www.reddit.com/r/EARONS/comments/8k5bc2/vrexeter_ransacker_early_parts_of_the_mo_plus_guns/,"On the podcast, 12-25-76, the hosts read the police blog from the Exeter newspaper. The ransackings in Exeter begin just before JJD  moved to Exeter, but his sister had already been living there. He would have gone down for job interviews and may have been living with his sister after his internship in Roseville (there is a 20 week gap in his whereabouts right after his graduation).

As a side note, the EAR rapes also begin before JJD has started his job in Auburn, but during the phase where he would have been going for interviews. It's clear he was very close to being suspected in the VR case. Those of you who have followed the VR case know what I mean.

Anyway, what struck me about the Exeter Ransacker (aside from the coins and the piggy bank and the proximity to JJD's sister's house) is that in the earliest ones, he consistently scored guns, lots of them. I lost count, but there were at least 20 guns stolen by the Exeter Ransacker. It was almost as if the perp knew who had guns and who didn't. 

The gun stealing led to a more intense focus on the crimes in Exeter (the establishment of a Burglary detail, which JJD was promoted to oversee). The thing that apparently made the good citizens of downtown Exeter demand more from their police force was a brazen robbery of a business, wherein 4 portable televisions were stolen.

During the Exeter/VR years it's clear that the ransacker was using some crimes as diversionary tactics in others. He set fires in packing houses and sheds, and then committed his burglaries while the only other police officer was out on that call. It became clear to Exeter PD that this was going on, so the Police Chief himself (who retired abruptly after the TV heist) would go patrol Main Street when they got one of these arson calls. When all of this came to light, the Chief abruptly retired, and JJD was given a promotion in the aftermath of that.

So, my questions are: does LE now have in its possession some of those many guns, from JJD's house, or did he buy entirely new ones? 

Another interesting thing is that after both the Visalia and Exeter ransackings were under way, JJD/VR began to leave pieces of one crime scene at another, perhaps in an attempt to mislead police. The number of times he must have responded or investigated his own crimes in Exeter is astonishing. He was seen, btw, by Beth Snelling and her boyfriend just before he murdered Prof. Snelling. The Exeter perp had the same behavior (leaving things from one crime at the site of another).

ER also went back to some houses and attacked more than once. One lady gave an interview to the paper after being an early burglary victim, and about a year later, she was attacked again.

One of the families was not only hit three times, but later, a body was deposited/killed on the edge of their property and they briefly became suspects. From this family, the ransacker stole ham radio equipment (and only the most expensive elements, going only into the radio room and not ransacking anywhere else). 

My hope is that some of that equipment turned up in JJD's Citrus Heights house. There is a mast antennae atop his house (looks newish to me). 

At any rate, I'm hoping that more than one of the hundreds/thousands of items stolen from Exeter (beginning near his sister's house) and Visalia show up in the list of items obtained with the search warrant.

BTW, in those days, he routinely took cash - lots of it, often $500 at a time. He may have entered houses more than once before striking. He may have used his Burglary Task Force knowledge (he went out to people's houses to assist them in making their homes safer) to know where they hid their cash or that they had cash. The amount of cash taken by the VR/JJD was in the thousands of dollars (just as it was for EAR).

Oddly, the one family he struck three times (and who owned the ranch bordering where the body of one of the murdered girls was found) also owned the condo next to the Offerman/Manning place in Goleta. Lots of ""coincidences"" for investigators to look over. 

(I think I got all of this right, corrections welcome)."
8k5wtl,49,2018-05-17,And... I'm out,Alex_Werner,GDS3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GDS3/comments/8k5wtl/and_im_out/,"Well, I was the first person eliminated from the top 8. What happened? How does it feel? Super quick answer: I didn't do a great job. And, it suuuuuuucks. It feels a lot like getting dumped. Or, not surprisingly, getting an interview for your dream job and then not getting hired.

This is two months in the past for me at this point, so the pain has faded, but for the first few days, it was just a cloud looming over everything. And I'm still spending a fair bit of time running over my final designs in my mind, trying to decide what I could have done better, etc.

Something to keep in mind, when looking at my submissions, and the submissions for the next four eliminated contestants, is that the GDS is HARD. Really, really hard. You're trying to first come up with a bunch of designs, then playtest, then narrow down to which ones you actually want to submit, then pick all the final details, all with the pressure of this super amazing opportunity hanging over you, all by yourself, in a very brief length of time. I made multiple really dumb mistakes because I was thinking about one thing and just overlooked something else. I'm sure the other top 8 will tell you the same.

I'm going to type up a lengthier post discussing my submissions and where I think I did wrong, but for now, a few final thoughts about my GDS experience:

\(1\) Overall, it was awesome. Much better than not making it past the multiple choice test, which is what happened to me in GDS1 and GDS2. And they can't take away my awesome T\-shirt and playmat.

\(2\) I'm incredibly impressed by the level of talent in the magic design community as a whole, both in the rest of the top 8, and in other designs people submitted, the ""almost there"" cards MaRo highlighted, etc. 

\(3\) Missing out on the Wizards jobs sucks. But, to be blunt, it's not as big a deal for me as it would be for a lot of people, particularly someone younger. I've got a good job \(in the video game industry in fact\), and a house, and a life. Uprooting myself and my family, moving to Seattle, and going from being a senior programmer to the most junior intern would probably end up being a lot less fun than it sounds. What I am sad to miss out on, though, is the chance for any of my ideas to actually get printed as magic cards. When I have fantasies of things going differently, it's not getting an email from MaRo saying ""oh, hey, clerical error, we have to redo the top 8, you're back in"" it's ""hey, just to let you know, we took one of your cards from the design challenge and put it in the design file for the spring 2020 big set"".

Which brings me to my primary thought, which is that there's this massive pool of talented and passionate magic cards designers out in the community. Between the Goblin Artisans site, and reddit's custommagic, and all the people who entered the GDS \(not to mention all the people outside the US who couldn't\) there's an amazing worldwide pool of card designs just begging to be printed. And it's a terrible shame that WotC hasn't found a way to tap that. Sure, there's a YMTC every 4 years or so. But it would be absolutely fantastic if there was something like that far more often.

Of course, the big problem is the logistics. R&amp;D doesn't possibly have the time to read over 10,000 card submissions every month. But there's a solution to that, which is to take advantage of the wisdom of the crowd itself. Note that the reddit majority consensus got 75/75 on the multiple choice test. Have people submit cards. And then have people rate the submissions. And then R&amp;D doesn't even need to look at them until they've been crowdsourced down to just a handful. It just seems like such a win\-win\-win to me: \(1\) R&amp;D gets an influx of fresh card designs. And if you look at their feedback on the best submissions from the various GDS challenges, presumably very good card designs. \(2\) All of us get a regular chance to reach for that golden ring and have a card we designed possibly get printed. And we actually get feedback from the community about how good our designs were, how close we came, etc. \(3\) The community involvement then increases enthusiasm for magic as a whole, as we all feel more invested in a game that is ""ours"" more than ever before. 

Probably just a pipe dream, sadly, but something like that would be fantastic.

Anyhow, thanks for reading, thanks to anyone who said kind words about any of my designs in the design challenge and the top 8, and I'll see you all in reddit/4/GDS4."

8k6yir,14,2018-05-17,Secure Multi-Party Computation (sMPC) in a nutshell.,BartSMPC,instar,https://www.reddit.com/r/instar/comments/8k6yir/secure_multiparty_computation_smpc_in_a_nutshell/,"# Secure Multi-Party Computation in a nutshell by Bart:

Before I start my ramble about; why sMPC is great, what fuels it and what it can achieve, I'll give a little background info about myself.

I've worked for CBS \(Central Bureau for Statistics\) or Statistics Netherlands during my 6 month internship, researching sMPC in the context of creating a new way to handle and create statistics. I've been in contact with 3 of the most prominent sMPC supplying companies and have asked away to my hearts contents.

I'll start with an anecdote that involves a famous problem and easy to understand use\-case, ""The Millionaire problem"".

# Traditional scenario of the 'Millionaire problem':

Let's say there are 5 individuals named Jon, Vincent, Kale, Trevor and Bob. Jon, Vincent, Kale and Trevor \(***JVKT*** for short\) are all millionaires and live a wealthy life. The JVKT millionaires are rather rich but don't know who's the richest of them all. However, they don't want to show each other how much they each specifically have. That's where Bob comes in. Let's say Bob is incorruptable and therefore unbribable and will always supply the correct answer and never leak data.

The ***JVKT millionaires*** each supply their balance numbers to Bob, consequently trusting Bob not to leak any data or give a false answer. Bob computes the answer for the millionaires by comparing how much each party has, after comparing the numbers Bob provides the answer on which millionaire has the most money. No exact number was provided only a name was provided as an answer by Bob.

[Traditional Scenario](https://i.redd.it/prdf4bv7cvz01.png)

# Flaws of the Traditional scenario:

* Bob has to be trusted to not leak or sell any data that was provided to him.
* Bob has to be trusted to not provide false information due to a bribe.
* Bob has to be trusted to provide a correct answer having the human error factor in mind.

In short; trust should not be the driving force behind this scenario, instead it's alot better to rely on a mathmatically proven and correct protocol to deal with computing the answer. This protocol can then be peer reviewed extensively by peers, meaning the factor of trust is mitigated and no longer necessary since the protocol can be reviewed by anyone.

# Solving the 'Millionaire Problem' with Secure Multi-Party Computation:

The exact same scenario as before now takes place, but instead of using Bob to compute the data we'll use a mathmatically proven and secure protocol called Secure Multi\-Party Computation to compute the answer. The ***JVKT millionaires*** now each make an individual dataset composed out of their own account balance numbers. Each millionaire locks their dataset with their own 'key' encrypting the dataset. This key is derived from a sort of 'master\-key', but I'll go in further detail about that later on.

After the ***JVKT millionaires*** have locked their dataset they each determine what kind of answer they want to compute, namely who's the richest person of the bunch without giving out what each individual has. After they agree on what they want to compute the computation can start. During the computation the data does not have to be decrypted meaning during the entire process the data is never decrypted untill it creates the answer. After the computation is complete an answer is created in encrypted form. The ***JVKT millionaires*** decide to decrypt the answer using their 'keys' to 'unlock' the answer. This answer will only provide the name of the richest millionaire. Each millionaire now knows who's the richest millionaire without knowing how much money each millionaire has!

[Secure Multi-Party Computation](https://i.redd.it/l1hla7m2cvz01.png)

# Achieved:

* Factor of trust is eliminated.
* Data is always encrypted during computation using fully homomorphic encryption, meaning it's **safe** the entire way through.

* Can be used to compute a large amount of data without having to decrypt it.
* The Protocol can be peer\-reviewed meaning it's functions are fully transparant.

# Underlying protocols:

* Zero knowledge
   * Can prove to other parties that the used expressions are true without knowing the contents of the expressions.
* \(Shamir's\) \(Threshold\) Secret  Sharing.
   * A pre\-configured amount of parties have to agree \(threshold\) to decrypt the answer before the answer can be decrypted using their own key's that originate from the 'master\-key'.
* Oblivious Transfer
   * Fragmented data is sent without the party knowing what part of the data is sent and when that part of fragmented data is sent.

# Possible use-cases:

Now that you've seen the solve for the millionaire problem and it's use\-case you could easily think of more possibilities with sMPC:

* Secure Cloud Computing
   * Since you never have to decrypt your data during computation the cloud is no longer unsafe to compute data in!
* Secure Statistics
   * You've seen the simple example of the Millionaire Problem, but it is possible to think on a way larger scale then before!
* Secure Election\-Voting
   * Since your data is never decrypted to compute it is possible to hold elections via the internet!
* Alot more!

This is Secure Multi\-Party Computation in a nutshell, although it does not describe all the underlying protocols and settings it hopefully creates a clear picture of the possibilities of this technology.

As I've described above, I've talked to three of the most prominent sMPC providers before \(Unbound Tech \(previously Dyadicsec\), Sharemind and ofcourse the first to work with sMPC, **Partisia**\) . It just so happens th**at Insights Netw**ork has the pleasure to work with the pioneers of sMPC products, nam**ely Parti**sia! I highly recommend to see the video which i've linked below where Ivan Damgard of Partisia \(one of the leading researchers on sMPC\) explains Secure Multi\-Party Computation.

If you enjoyed reading this and would like to read more in\-depth explanations on protocols please ask me and I'll happily provide you with more information.

Cheers, Bart.

Maybe I'd say a few words to you every now and then, have a pleasant conversation, maybe even get a picture at the end, but I mostly did it to help out the potential of working in movies later on in life.

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

Hey! I'm Matthew, 21 years old and I'm looking for a girl to play as a celeb on this big movie premier. Ideally the two of us flirt for a little bit before sneaking off for some alone time. This can be as vanilla or as kinky as you desire, either way is perfectly fine with me.

 As Democrats, we value inclusion not simply because a diverse coalition is a strong coalition, but because we know that in order to expand opportunities for all Americans, all Americans must have a seat at the table. That's why we're building a team that knows what it takes to win in every community -- and the report below is a transparent examination of the DNC's efforts to build a party that truly reflects every single Democrat.

 In presenting this report, we aim to both hold ourselves accountable and provide a roadmap for our partners within the progressive movement.
 Leadership
 Last year brought about an 80% increase in DNC officers of color. We now have a more diverse leadership pool than at any point in our party's history. We've more than doubled the number of African-American officers and increased the number of Latino officers.

 Our senior leadership, which includes all department heads, also saw impressive diversity gains. We've seen a 67% increase in leaders of color and a 40% increase in women leaders. Women now make up two-thirds of directors at the DNC.

 Last month, we invited prominent Black women leaders to come to our headquarters for a collaborative strategy session on our 2018 African American outreach and engagement efforts. This is part of our ongoing leadership strategy to be more inclusive and connected to community leaders and stakeholders.
 Staff
 A major part of the new leadership's rebuilding process included increasing staffing levels from historic lows following the 2016 cycle in order to ramp up the organizing and mobilizing efforts that led to the past year's victories. As Tom Perez often notes, personnel is policy and reflects an organization's priorities. The urgent need to staff up at the DNC provided an immediate opportunity to put our commitment into action.

 Under our new leadership, the DNC has increased:
•       African-American staff by 36%
•       Asian-American/Pacific Islander staff by 30%
•       Latino staff by 340%
•       LGBTQ staff by 28%
 Overall, 44% of DNC staffers are people of color. 51% of DNC staff are women.
 Internships
 We know that internships serve as the gateway into a career in politics. But the opportunity costs of unpaid internships are too burdensome for too many young people who are otherwise qualified -- and we know that this disproportionately affects young people of color, and other historically marginalized communities.

 Tom Perez promised to end unpaid internships, and for the first time in DNC history, the spring 2018 class of interns received a stipend. We are excited by the increased diversity: Under the new policy 42% of our spring interns are people of color.
 Contractors
 Like the staffing policy, we believe that the contracting and procurement process should create opportunities and be accessible and transparent, and our vendors should reflect the diversity of our country. Tom Perez followed through on his campaign commitments related to supplier diversity. All contracts and contractors will be reviewed before renewal -- there is no longer automatic renewal in practice or policy. The DNC has also eliminated many of the pre-existing contracts. We intentionally brought many services and talent in house to cut expenses as part of our rebuilding effort.

 Our Chief Operating Officer, Laura Chambers, manages all diversity initiatives for the organization and has begun a new contract approval process that tracks all vendors receiving contracts of at least $5,000 in much greater detail  --  by gender, racial, and ethnic diversity.

 Now outside consulting contracts only make up about 2% of the DNC's operating budget, with 29% of that money spent on contracts going to women and minority-owned businesses. We have also put out a national call for diverse vendors to submit their qualifications and intend to share this database of vendors so it is a resource to state parties and our partners in the Democratic community.
 Moving forward
 Democrats believe that our leadership should always reflect the diversity of our party and our country. It is a political and moral imperative. We simply cannot be effective advocates for the communities we represent if we do not accurately reflect them at every single level --  from staff, to party officers, to elected officials. Our work isn't complete, but we've made unprecedented progress. And we can say with confidence that we've spent this last year keeping our promise to build a Democratic Party that provides a voice for every single Democrat.

 Thank you for your continued support,

 Xochitl

 Xochitl Hinojosa
 Communications Director
 Democratic National Committee

 P.S. -- The key to our party's success in the years to come will be making investments in the women and people of color who form the backbone of our party. Democrats will win because our party accurately reflects the communities that we hope to represent."""

As a lot of you have [way] more experience than me in the process towards getting a commercial license I was looking for some advice. 

I have my PPL and recently finished my night rating at a private flight school in Canada. I also just finished a MA and have an internship at an aviation firm for an analysis job soon. However, despite having an aviation desk job, I want to pursue my commercial license but I am not sure where to start. 

I have about 90 hours right now and realistically wont be able to fully afford my commercial license for another year or two, however, I don't want to stop flying or working towards something. 

I was wondering what people's opinions are towards working on an instrument rating or multi engine rating and put that time towards my commercial? I was thinking of starting to study for the commercial written soon or something along that matter but I don't know the ""best"" order to go in. 

As well I have recently moved from an english province to Quebec where pilots are allowed to speak french. Although I am more or less bilingual I am a little nervous to join a flight school that operates in french as well as hearing french speaking pilots on the enroute frequency. 

Any insight helps, i'm really just trying to get an idea on how I should continue the path towards my commercial. 

Thanks!!"

I will be doing consulting for companies as a team to set up and troubleshoot distributed control systems with the use of an automation software.

But me being proactive and anxious to be successful, I want to read something to be ahead of the game when I get there. I have used their software before at a previous internship as an intern but I've never done any programming. I also did not have a process control or safety course in school, however, both were presented to me in small lectures in other courses.

What knowledge can I bring to this job that will help me get accustomed most quickly? I only have a big picture idea of what I will be doing at work, the fine technical details are somewhat unclear. Process control calculations? Safety interlocks/alarm systems? Programming? Validation? 

TLDR;
Job title is process automation systems engineer, not exactly sure what skills I should master before I start work so I can be good at my job.

I (21F) have very toxic and controlling parents. Not sure if this is the right sub because I'm not sure if they're technically narcissists but they are definitely controlling to say the least. So I'm writing this to finally vent and to see what you all think since you all have experience with difficult parents.
When we moved to the suburbs where I live now, they put me in an expensive catholic school despite living in a good school district because they thought it would be ""better"" since it cost a lot of money and because it was all-girls school (they wanted to keep me away from the opposite sex.) The academics were fine but equal to the public school's. And the students were just as ""bad"" as public school students since high schoolers at any school will drink. They were strict during high school which I chalked up to them being African immigrants since I never did anything ""bad"" in high school except getting my nose pierced. Which she slapped and berated me for, before demanding I remove it the reaction of any sane adult. /s
When I turned 16, I was excited to learn drive just like anyone would be. So I took Driver's Ed and prepared for the road test. Since my younger brother is in Special Education, they were eager to get me to drive so that I could drive him to his tutoring sessions. So I took the test but I scored just under passing. So my mom scheduled another test just a few days later at a place an hour away to make sure I could drive my brother around that summer. But I failed that one too. After that, there was a lot of pressure to drive so I could drive him around. I was fine picking him up from school everyday (it was walking distance), helping with his homework and cooking dinner for the family had but they wanted me to drive him around too. Me driving stopped being about me and became about me helping them with my brother. I was fine helping out within reason but my brother is not my son and therefore not my responsibility. I am not the one who chose to have a kid.
Breakfasts and dinners also have to be in a certain order or my mom gets mad that we didn't eat the right meal on the right day - not sure if this is her being controlling, having OCD or a combination of both.
Fast forward to college. Of course I have to go because it's the path to the American dream. I was excited to finally get away from home and they were paying so I had nothing to lose. During my first year, they were still as strict when I was back home on breaks. If I wanted to go out it was an interrogation ""who, where, why"" and don't be out late (as in past 9 or 10pm). But for the most part it's fine since I do not communicate with them much while I'm away (no contact with my mom and limited texts with my dad.)
But my first summer back from home, they decided not to let me work and make me study calculus (with an online textbook - not even an actual class) since I had failed the class my first semester (ended up not needing the class anyway since I switched majors after that semester) and drag me on a family trip to Africa as well for a month-long family trip. Their reasoning was my grandma had passed away the previous year and the tombstone ceremony was that summer. However I had not had any real relationship with her since we didn't speak the same language and I'd only seen her once every few years. I had wanted to stay and after numerous fights I was still dragged along. During this trip, I had to share a bedroom with my 2 younger siblings and since I was in a foreign country where I did not know the local language (parents never bothered to teach me or my siblings) I could not even go out on my own to get a break from my family.
On the flight back, I order a glass of wine and my mom got mad because it's alcohol (despite me being 19 at the time and 18 being the legal age in the country SHE dragged me to.) After we get back I don't have much time before it's time to head back to school for the fall semester. I take the train to school so she drives me there to drop me off and while I go inside to double check I'm on the right train track she said she decided to snoop one of my suitcases since it felt heavy. When I got back she was livid because she found a bottle of wine in my luggage. While I was underage in the U.S., her reaction to scream at me in public was a bit much to say the least. People were looking over at this crazy lady screaming her lungs out at me. She interrogated me as to where it came from, asked me if I was smoking or doing drugs (a HUGE leap to make from a bottle of wine), told me not to be a slut and asked if I had a boyfriend in college that was ""making me do things"" (because apparently it's inconceivable that I might just like to drink like any other college student.) All the while I was crying from embarrassment because this batshit crazy person is yelling at me in a train station as if she'd found hard drugs or something. I finally get on the train back to school and she's calling me on the phone saying things like ""this isn't over"" and I'm in trouble. Yet Thanksgiving break, no mention of all this since I guess she realized it's not like she has any control over what I do away at college. Though she'd ""cleaned"" my room and thrown my vibrators out (which were very well hidden.)
Right before that Thanksgiving break, I'd started seeing someone. We ended up in a relationship soon after and are still dating. However, my parents still don't know (right now the only family members that know about him are my 2 cousins who live with us.) The summer after sophomore year, my parents and siblings go back to Africa to visit and thankfully I'm not dragged along this time. So while they're gone for the month, I finally have a taste of freedom while I'm home which meant I got to join my boyfriend on his family vacation and just hang out like a regular 20 year old without being checked up on constantly.
Junior year comes and sometime after Christmas break, they decide to install security cameras on (and in) the house. One in the front, one in the back and one in the kitchen - with audio. For context, the town I live in is wealthy with a country club and expensive boutiques in the downtown area. After a few days, the kitchen camera is gone but the other 2 remain.
It's sometime after spring break now and I'm back at school. My boyfriend surprises me by saying his mom has invited me to come with him and his family on his graduation trip to Florida. It's during the review period before finals and I've been doing well in all my classes so I'm able to go. It is always such a stark contrast to see how my boyfriend and his brother interact with their parents. My friends say it's because they're guys and parents are more relaxed with boys than girls but even if they'd had a daughter my age, I couldn't see then harping on her for being out past 10pm. 
Fast forward just a little bit and I'm preparing to come back home for the summer. Dreading coming back to the prison with cameras. But it's not like I have a choice. So after finals, I spend a few days with my boyfriend before my dorm closes for the summer.
I get back home and a friend texts me to see if I'm still
interested in being recommended to work at the same restaurant. I say of course since I only heard back from one internship and didn't get it. So I go to interview and it goes great. So I text my mom asking if she can pick up a bus pass since I got the hostess job.
She doesn't bother texting back but yesterday instead of saying congrats on the job or some other acknowledgement,  all she could bother to say was ""You should learn to drive or the little money you make will go to transportation."" I learned a loooong time ago that nothing is ever good enough and this is just the latest example of that. Because apparently $5 a day for the bus will somehow outweigh making just below minimum wage plus tips. Don't know why she can't just keep her mouth shut instead of being negative for no reason.
And they're the reason I don't drive in the first place. Because after the first 2 tests, there was just so much pressure to get this stupid piece of plastic just so I could help *them* out. After being made to feel like shit just because I didn't have a license, I was just done being motivated to get one. Fact is, I'm honestly glad I don't have one because a license would not equal freedom for me. If I got a license, sure they would let me drive their car to work. But that's it. I could take it to and from work and that's it. They would never let me take it anywhere but work and maybe tutoring appointments. So after taking a self-esteem hit over my lack of driving ability, that is certainly not a good enough reason for me to get back behind the wheel. I do know I'll need to drive pretty soon, I'm almost done with my bachelor's degree after all. But the thought of taking lessons from some random instructor or being stuck in a car with my parents criticizing my driving makes me wanna put it off for as long as I possibly can. I guess it's safe to say that driving has definitely become a sore spot for me.
They're probably also the reason I likely don't want kids. Or at least in part. I don't find kids cute past age 5 or 6 and raising someone until 18 is a lot of work I don't want. But seeing how much they fucked up, really makes me wanna avoid the risk of being a bad parent.
Sorry this isn't short enough for a TL/DR :-/"
8k9485,3,2018-05-17,"partial spoilery thoughts from teaser; So most of us were seeing a bad end for everyone, but it looks more like a partial redemption for Liz and Stan",Ae87,TheAmericans,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAmericans/comments/8k9485/partial_spoilery_thoughts_from_teaser_so_most_of/,"So for the last few weeks I was certain the three doomed characters, Elizabeth, Stan and Paige. I mean truly doomed even if they live, since stan would be seen as an idiot, Elizabeth as hardliner left behind by history, and Paige had no viable future.

I now think the writers are going to go for redemption for Elizabeth and Stan.

It looks for certain the writers are going to have Elizabeth work against the anti-gorbachov coup. Great scene with Elizabeth and Claudia with Elizabeth saying ""but not the party,"" really showing the core of the show is about ideology.

Stan has an out from a fully ignominious fate of being the biggest fool ever, in the upcoming trailer
[Spoiler](/s ""we see him seeming to be the believer in the jenning's guilt and having to convince an incredulous Aderholt et al."")

 Full redemption? No. but some.  There is that scene with Gaad simply repeating that he was the CI director whose secretary *married* an KGB officer. You can't live down situations Gaad was in, and you can't live down being a senior FBI CI officer  being besties with a KGB officer either. But still, if he gets to play Cassandra for an episode it is a bit of face saving.

On Paige 
[Spoiler](/s ""we see an argument with her mother in the teaser with Elizabeth saying she had nothing to do with 'that boy' so perhaps the intern she used committed suicide and pages anger might giver her redemption in turning herself in. We also see Father Tim who could serve to attest to Paige's indoctrination/brainwashing by her parents""). 
Still I see Paige as the most likely sacrifice but anything goes.

As far as redemption and the possible writers decisions to Jennings both turning so quickly, I think that is audience service by the writers more than reality. I personally don't dislike stories that end very tragically and don't present a moral.

Thoughts?

8k9va1,1,2018-05-17,Me [19 F] with my [21 M] boyfriend? of 5 months are in a complicated situation.,DryEchidna,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8k9va1/me_19_f_with_my_21_m_boyfriend_of_5_months_are_in/,"TLDR; [Foreign student swept me off my feet, but didn't want a serious relationship per say, though he's stuck through with me for 5 months. Really, I think he gave the relationship a more comforting label. We had a spat, and now we haven't talked for a while. What should I do?]


I met him at university during first semester in one of my classes, but we didn't go on a date until the beginning of second semester. He took me out to a fancy Italian place and paid for everything. The chemistry was insane, and our date lasted six hours. 


We went back to university, where he said ""the only thing that could make this night more perfect is if I could sleep next to you tonight."" So I was like ""woah, I'm not that kind of girl, but we can go out some other night."" And he said, ""no, I swear--just sleeping."" So I went back to his place, because I was attracted to him. We spent the entire night laughing, making out, giving each other massages, cuddling. The next morning came, and he didn't want to let me leave his room, and I thought it was cute. I had to study, so of course he let me go my way, and he texted me later he was already falling for me. This was too much, so I told him it wouldn't work out.

Fast forward to later that day--I told him I'm being stupid and I only like a-holes, and here I have a guy who actually likes me, and I'm letting that go. So we agreed to see where things went. I asked him later on if he wanted me to be his girlfriend, and he said that because he's from a different country and has to leave in a year, it doesn't make sense to be completely serious about this because there's a deadline to the relationship.


So, I asked then, what is this, and he replied: More than friendship, less than a relationship--still insisting this wasn't casual. (To me, this is a relationship under a different name--but he didn't want to define it so.) He later tells me he wants to be in a relationship with me, but knows he can't because of x, y, and z. 


My grandma died at some point, and he came to see me on the day that she died so we could drink together and I could mourn. If I tell him I have a PTSD attack from my past after the fact that it happens, he always insists I should have called him so he could have been there. 

We go on and off for a month, where I see other people. I had already fallen for someone else by the time he came back, apologizing for being so wishy-washy and saying he was still interested in me. I wasn't so receptive to him at first, but as I realized that it wouldn't work out with the other guy, then I started seeing him more. When he found out he had a summer internship, he suggested we hang out over the summer, and that I could stay with him/cook with him/have fun with him. 


It feels natural to fall for him, but it's scary. He and I started seeing each other once or twice a week, even though he would pull three all-nighters a week to study for his degree because his major is difficult. It wasn't until the end of the semester that we slept together, and it was very sudden and unplanned. Being a victim of abuse, he knew my past. I was shaking and crying after, not because of him, but because of my past. He held me until I calmed down and kissed me/cuddled with me/gave me massages for hours that night. He had to go back home after the semester for a month to visit his parents, but promised he would see me when he comes back. Even on the day he left, he said he would see me when he comes back. 


But, he has a reputation as player at university. It doesn't make sense for him to invest 5 months into a single girl if he's playing me, so I tried not to think about it. However, I sent him a picture of my female friend and me in bed together because we had a sleepover, and he made a joke about a threesome. I got angry because of this, and told him off. We haven't messaged for almost a week now, and I'm waiting for him to say something but he doesn't. I'm not sure what to do. Did I make I mistake? Or was he not that interested in the first place? "

So basically, everything that we predicted happened. Calzona reunited (offscreen, but it was implied). April and Matthew not only got back together but they got married. 

April's exit made no sense. Zip. Zero!! They spent an entire season building a downward spiral for April. She was drinking excessively, showing up to work hung over, lost her belief in God. She even spent a whole episode apologizing and ""getting her affairs in order"". She told Jackson she was happy that Harriet had him to look after her (such a strange thing to say for someone who's sticking around). She was having random sex with interns and koracik (who is actually great for April...I could ship them). Then...she's fine? All that buildup and she's okay?
As for Matthew...April left him at the altar. His wife died and he indirectly blamed April. He did not want to be in the same room as April or even speak to her a few short episodes ago. He's still grieving. Now we are supposed to believe that Matthew forgave April and moved on from the death of Karin? And April moved on from her spiral? Now they've been together for months, as Arizona had to tell us. Because there was absolutely no foreshadowing and it seemed like it came out of thin air.
My guess...the plan for April was much more negative and gruesome. Krista wanted to kill japril and murder any hope of them reuniting. The only true way to do that is to kill April. Knowing Krista and her motives, I think the original plan was a drunk driving accident with April behind the wheel. Either April dies immediately OR she has a passenger that dies from the accident, and April goes to jail for involuntary manslaughter. Either one paints April in a negative light and effectively kills japril.  As for who the potential passenger would be, it could be anyone that Krista wanted to get rid of. Easy. Maybe even Arizona if they wanted to get rid of both of them in one swoop (although I think killing off arizona would have been a bit much. Now Sofia has 2 dead parents. But I don't put anything past Krista).
I don't think they expected the backlash from the leaked news of the firings. Once the network (or even Shonda) saw this, they made Krista change the end. It does give me comfort to know that Krista was probably livid about April leaving alive!

I do like teddy and am happy she's back. We all predicted the pregnancy though, it was so predictable. I think that either Amelia gets pregnant too, OR the three of them live together and do a coparenting relationship. I also think that Teddy will have birth complications that endanger either her life or the baby's life. Because Amelia is already traumatized from the birth of her son (born without a brain), she will have to deliver the baby alone. She and teddy will probably be trapped somewhere or maybe there will be a storm that strands them. Both teddy and baby will be fine though and the 4 of them will all live happily every after.

Ha I didn't realize how long this would be!"
8ka5mg,1,2018-05-17,Abdominal discomfort for 2 months,greenie97,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8ka5mg/abdominal_discomfort_for_2_months/,"F 5’4” 130 lbs. 20 years old

Medications: tri-lo-Marzia and dicyclomine (20 mg 4x a day)

2 months ago I had food poisoning (fever, chills, vomiting) that lasted for a few days. I was back to normal eating. A couple weeks later I started getting what felt like gas pains in my mid-upper abdominal area that didn’t go away for weeks. I went to the doctor, tested positive for h. Pylori, took omeprazole/amoxicillin/clarithromycin for 2 weeks. Eventually the pain did go away but came back. I thought it was cause of lactose but it was weird how the pain wouldn’t go away even though the lactose should be out of my system. 

I would have the pain for 1-2 weeks, be great for a few days, and then it would come back. It ranges from a dull background discomfort to bloating and sharp gas pains. Also some pressure in the lower abdomen at times. The only thing that helps is exercising (running and lifting) or laying down on my side. I feel it the most when I’m just standing or walking around. 

I’m going back to my GP next week for a retest. I’m really not sure what to do. Im moving across the country in a few weeks for an internship, so I’m not sure when I’d be able to get an endoscopy or colonoscopy which is worrying me. 

I’ve tried simethicone for the gas, peppermint oil pills, more fiber (which is normally a trigger for gas pains for me). I’ve been tested for celiac, blood, thyroid, and fecal occult blood which came back fine. I started Bentyl/dicyclomine last week which really seemed to help but the pain came back. I got a second opinion but was told I probably have an ulcer and to just take omeprazole even though I was never scoped for an ulcer...

So my question is can lactose intolerance pains last like this? Is it probably food intolerance, anxiety/stress or something more? 

EDIT: age. Also forgot to mention my stools are normal and I can pass gas so I don’t think it’s obstruction "

I have been in a relationship with a person for the last year. We have been up and down but overall really freaking great. I always remember a moment where we met up and got each other the same exact gift (It nothing to most people but just an inside joke/hobby thing we had that connected us). We had a lot and lot of plans for this Summer. We were far away from each other in different countries but she moved to UK to try and close the distance. It's still a 3 hour drive (5 hour bus) from my home town where I'm going to uni. I had to go through a lot to move my stuff to her place but a few days before I moved here, we argued about something. One day she wanted to go out with her friend. She did and she went out drinking at his place until 4 or 5 and forgot to message when she got home. I asked about this, we talked, argued, and it essentially came down to ""I don't really like this"" or something similar. This set off a lot of things. The last few days she has been constantly saying she doesn't know what she wants in life. We had a lot of long term goals that I was convinced was for the both of us. She is constantly saying she doesn't know what she wants at all but she said she just knows that she's not 100% sure she wants me there for the summer. We had this conversation the day I got all my stuff moved there. I very much feel as though me being around is stopping her from having fun with her new friend/s. I talked to her about it and she couldn't confirm or deny it. She sais in her entire life she has always been relying and bubbling herself along with the person she's been with and doesn't want to do that anymore. Me being around would not help there. She said she constantly limits herself and what she does when she goes out because of who she's been with and doesn't want to anymore. I said that's fine but I dunno about drinking and staying at this guys place until 3 or 4 or whatever and not saying when she comes home. We have decided that I should go back. At first I tried to see things from her perspective but I feel so fucking shitty... I dunno how to contain it. This thing we have worked so hard for, I got a job here for the summer, I had to lie to the only family member that I am close to to get here, I gave up a really good summer internship (I talked to her about that when it came up a long time ago but she said she'd be really sad that we couldn't spend the summer together. I thought I was a monster that she gave so much effort to be here for us so I cancelled it). We agreed we need to put ourselves first then the other person. Now I am going back home but she keeps saying it's not that we're breaking up and things are okay, she just needs some freedom and indiependence. I feel so freaking hurt... We talked and she says everything is fine but the person I knew 2 weeks ago was nothing like the person here now... I don't really know what to do... I told her if she needs a ""break from the relationship"" or whatever, I'd just rather break up. I'm not a toy, I'm not gonna be picked up when needed and dropped when not.

I got no idea where we're headed now. I have no clue when we will meet again. I am leaving tomorrow and I will have no idea what she'll be up to or what's gonna change. Everything is so messed up right now and I just really need some advice and to vent.

Thanks a lot and sorry for the long post lol

8kblj2,28,2018-05-18,Irony - My Plans for Eliminating Rivals,drkinferno72,yandere_simulator,https://www.reddit.com/r/yandere_simulator/comments/8kblj2/irony_my_plans_for_eliminating_rivals/,"My goals for Yandere Sim Rivals – Irony

Yanderedev has provided Yandere\-chan with many rivals for the heart of senpai \(blessed be his name\). They cannot love him the same way you could, they do not appreciate him the way you would. If they will not stand aside in awe of your love, they must be eliminated at any cost. Only a fool walks up to someone, stabs them, and expects to get away with it. No, this is a game that will require cunning, stealth, backstabbing and other underhanded means of taking out your rivals.

Now for my own goals when Yandere sim comes out, I believe there must be an ironic touch on each and every rival. A sort of “fitting end” for each. It need not be a murder, but it should fit the rival in their own way. These are just my particular ideas for what I intend to do in the game. Critique if you like. \(And it would be awesome if yanderedev put his two cents in \&lt;3 lol \). Megami will be the longest evaluation as she is the hardest rival.

First, there is the childhood friend rival, Osana Najimi. Senpai and Osana have known each other since they were small children. When they came of school age, feelings of love began to blossom inside of Osana, despite her tsundere demeanor. This love mustn’t be allowed to be realized. As a friend of snepai, she shouldn’t be killed. Instead, he must reject her love. As shown in the rejection video, a series of opportunities have been presented to allow for sabotage her efforts.

Conclusion: Rejection, make senpai hate Osana. 

The second rival, is Amai Odayaka. The president of the cooking club. This rival, intends to win senpai over with her cooking. As the easiest way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, as president, Amai is in prime condition to spoil Senpai with sweets, cakes and cookies. The irony I plan on going for is for one of two choices. As a chef, the importance of ingredients is a fragile one. Put the wrong ingredients in \(such as cyanide and sugar\) and you have a recipe for disaster. The way I see for taking out Amai is to poison a dish she’s making. Perhaps an opportunity will arise when she taste tests a cake batter and you happened to have slipped in some poison. 

Another idea of mind was to simply set the poor girl on fire with a combination of gasoline and a lit match. Ironic, the president of the cooking club was herself a little cooked.

Conclusion: Poisoning or arson

The third rival, is the aspiring actress, Kizana Sunobu. Sassy but classy, she intends to be the Juliet to Senpai’s Romeo. Unfortunately for her, this puts her in your sights. And no rival must be allowed to linger. Therefore, the goal here is simple. First, you must enter Kizana’s circle within the drama club \(this will give you access to masks if needed\). The idea here is to replace a prop weapon with a real one \(such as a sword in a duel that takes place, or even better. If Juliet is played then perhaps the fake poison she drinks, can be replaced with actual poison\). Another option could be to drop a chandelier, lights, or some other heavy object at the end of a play. If none of these cannot be done, just wear a mask and stab the girl. Then run like hell.

Conclusion: Replace prop weapon with the real thing, possibly fake poison with real poison

Fourth one is a little tricky for me. Oka Ruto is the president of the occult club. Who knows, perhaps we can make it look like the girl is some kind of psychopath and plans on sacrificing Senpai to raise a demon \(could be done, no one likes the occult club. Could be believable\). Personally, I don’t really want to take the girl out \(I like her, and she actually reminds me of my own girlfriend of all things\). Therefore I plan on setting Oka up with her own suitor. An irony elimination need not to be lethal. You wouldn’t expect someone so weird, so strange, and so creepy to be having other suitors. Therefore, eliminate Oka but finding her another man. 

Conclusion: Matchmake

Fifth is the athletic Asu Rito. Always enjoying a good run or workout, Asu perhaps spotted Senpai while out on a jog one day. Enamored with the shy and bookish Senpai, Asu intends to take him with her on runs and perhaps more. As an athlete, Asu works with many kinds of sporting equipment, from dumbbells to basketballs. Dumbbells are simply weights of steel, and that could prove lethal. I believe it would be fitting \(assuming you have enough physical education points\) to somehow lure the athlete to a spot near the school. Perhaps you can challenge Asu to meet at a particular spot near the school for a race or other athletic challenge. I do not believe that Asu would be the kind to turn down a challenge and would agree to meet. \(assuming you’ve befriended her\) But we’re smarter than this. Lure her to the spot, and take with you a dumbbell to the top of the school. Go to the spot where she’s standing and let slip the dumbbell. That’s another rival taken care of and in a body bag.

The idea for luring Asu with a challenge is to either confront her directly about it or leave a note \(forging Senpai’s handwriting\) in her locker.

Or perhaps Asu is an avid swimmer too. Perhaps we can use this opportunity to drown the girl if no one else is watching. Or bring a battery that one would use to jump start car and drop it into the pool. The water conducting the electricity should be enough to remove her from senpai’s heart. 

Conclusion: Lure Asu with a challenge, drop dumbbell on her. Or if possible electrocution in the pool.

The Sixth rival is a clumsy nurse named Muja Kina. My only guess as to why she’s at the school, is due to the fact she’s the new intern, learning the skills of a nurse where she happens upon Senpai who himself is sick. Only Yandere\-chan should be able to dot on a sick Senpai and thus the nurse has earned her retribution. 

Where irony comes in, my idea to eliminate her when the time is right is to constantly find ways to make it look like she’s awful at her job. Perhaps replace medicines with emetic poison to make the students sick, thus lowering her job performance. Perhaps even replace a syringe with poison. If a student dies while under the care of a student, she’s bound to lose her job. Or if constantly making senpai sick instead of making him better, Senpai would be bound to be disgusted by the sight of her.

The third option I see, is to take advantage of the poor nurse’s clumsiness. In her intro she tripping over nothing and spilling syringes everywhere \(which would also give you a window of opportunity to grab a few syringes\). Perhaps the nurse could be walking down stairs and slip on a student that a carless student \(you\) left behind on the stairs. Or a puddle of water that can be slipped on, and falls on the right spot can be fatal.

Conclusion: Sabotage the nurse’s job performance by making her use the wrong medicines or take advantage of her clumsiness.

The seventh rival of all things is a teacher. Mida Rana, substitute teacher for the week. As the song goes, Senpai is hot for teacher and the two must be separated at all costs. Straight out killing would be too difficult \(extensive self\-defense training like most of the school’s faculty\) no, underhanded methods must be used. Perhaps one could expose Mida Rana’s little “activities”. While Senpai is of age, no doubt he hasn’t graduated from school yet. The guidance counselor and the headmaster have a prestigious school’s reputation to maintain, and such behavior from a teacher and student well beyond the norms. 

Conclusion: Use Info\-Chan to dig up as much dirt as she can on the activities of Mida Rana.

The eighth rival is a no good delinquent named Osoro Shidesu. The rival has a sordid history with the school, such as beating students and leading others down the path to delinquency. While senpai could never love a girl with a bad reputation, perhaps he feels bad for this girl. Perhaps he “doesn’t judge her and looks past this”. Too bad, she’s all for yandere\-chan. As touching as that story is, Osoro must be eliminated.

Only a fool would attempt to fight a delinquent with a successful fight record \(who even kept the coat of an enemy as a trophy of all things\). No no, a fight would be far too sloppy, love won’t win a fight. So what to do? Perhaps framing Osoro for a crime as heinous as murder wouldn’t be out of the question. As seen in the delinquent report, the school is looking for any reason at this point to expel Osoro. But it would be very difficult to approach Osoro alone what with her gang of delinquents that follow her like puppies.

The first step towards an Osoro elimination would be to somehow rehabilitate her gang of delinquents. Put them on the right path towards life. Perhaps make them more assertive but not complete delinquents, not meek but good people who stand up for themselves. Reforming these individual’s would put you in the favor of the guidance counselor. Having such an important figure in your back pocket would be an extremely useful individual to have in your inner circle. Such an individual would be quite willing to hear from you, a concerned citizen that’s telling her all about the activities of Osoro.

Perhaps you can steal a switch blade or some other weapon that Osoro might use. Perhaps gloves will cover your own fingerprints as you sacrifice another student in senpai’s name. Perhaps you can get the police involved and eliminate Osoro that way.  

Conclusion: Reform the delinquents, and frame Osoro for murder or find expulsion. Who would believe a delinquent over a good honest citizen after all? 

The ninth rival is Senpai’s own sister, Hanako. She doesn’t lust after her brother like the other rivals. No, she’s simply a clingy younger sister who doesn’t want to share her brother with Yandere\-chan. This has marked her for death and clearly, she must go. But the question is a matter of how. As we are going for irony here, we will go after Senpai even. We will attack his stance as a big brother. As the older brother of Hanako, Senpai is very close to his sister and has a very strong big brother instinct. Therefore, Hanako is to die in front of Senpai. But we can’t kill her in front of him that will lead to a game over. Instead, we shall find another student and kidnap said student. We will spend the week turning her into a mindslave. Thus, when the next day begins the mind slave will take care of the little sister, all in front of senpai. Another idea, was to poison Hanako’s food, or use emetic poison on Hanko and take her home and leave her there in the basement. What only matters is that we attack Senpai’s inability to protect his younger sister. Be warned though, for this may effect the ending as well. The danger of senpai turning on you is too great.

Finally, there is the student council president herself, Megami Saikou. A true rival for the heart of senpai. Wealthy, a genius, extensive martial arts training to rival Ronda Rousey \(don’t even think of fighting her head on\), president of the student council and the most popular girl in all of Akademi High, she is a worthy adversary for the love of senpai. As student council president, she will enact efforts to stop you, such as installing cameras, employing security, and instating a zero tolerance policy towards awful behavior. Seems daunting? Not for a yandere. We have one advantage, no integrity. 

You shouldn’t play yandere simulator if you can’t get past frontal assaults, you won’t even make it to this week. Instead you must use all of your cunning and strategic skills to overcome this rival. I have taken the liberty of studying what Yandere Dev has spoken about Megami, her “training” her life before Week 10 and so on. She very capable mentally, barraged with questions from morning to night. Fed well, briefed on all aspects of Saikou Corps, attends classes from her laptop \(until week 10\), is an active athlete with running, sports and martial arts training with the best masters Japan has to offer. The company goes so far as to even hold “mock assassinations” on her. All of her training has molded her into the perfect CEO, the perfect athlete, the perfect fighter. However, we are a Yandere in love, we cannot quit, how can we overcame the greatest of threats?

We could for example, abduct a bunch of students \(which would be impossible as people would notice\) and send them all after Megami. My guess is that while one might give her a cut or two, they wouldn’t be able to finally finish her off for you, that would be too easy and the failed attempt would put the school on high alert which makes you happy ending with senpai but a farway dream. So what is something you can do?

I am a student of history, history is full of individuals fighting against great odds. From escapes from prison camps in world war 2 to clever generals outsmarting larger armies. The particular case we will examine is that of the Trojan War \(captured in Homer’s The Illiad\). The story goes that the Greeks went to war with the City of Troy \(over a woman of all things\) and fought battle after battle for the next ten years never making any progress as the Trojans held their own against the Greeks. Until one day, a clever soldier named Odysseus came up with the idea to hide a bunch of soldiers inside a giant wooden horse. They presented the horse to the Trojans as a sort of peace offering. When night fell, the squad of soldiers snuck out of the horse and opened Troy’s gates, allowing the Greeks to conquer Troy.

But what does a story about wooden horse have to do with a game about a Yandere fighting for her senpai’s love? The story is an analogy. You, Yandere\-chan is Odysseus, Senpai is your Helen, Megami is Troy, and cleverly enough, the student council is your ticket into Megami’s circle \(The Trojan Horse\).

Joining the council will not be easy. In fact, I believe it will require the completion of all side quests to boost your own reputation, gain the social support of your peers and friends, and the good will of your teachers. Taking down Megami, the Student Council president will not come from attacks from outside, but much like a contagion, a virus from within. Yes, the student council will require responsibilities, but do it for Senpai.

Once, inside the student council, you will have access to the associates of Megami, and eventually, Megami herself. While the student body might “appear loyal or morally sound” appearances, can be deceiving. For example it is rumored that Megami had something to do with the loss of Aoi Ryugoku’s eye \(she may be biding her time for revenge if it was quite personal\). Next there is Kuroko Kamenga. She was the former president of the student council before Megami jumped in. Perhaps she misses the power and prestige that came with the job and might be willing to help undermine Megami’s position, all for a price of course. Last there is Akane Toriyasu. Her profile claims that she is gentle and an airhead, yet this may be a façade. It is claimed she loves animals, but they run away from her. Why would they do this if she’s genuinely friendly? Perhaps she is the student at the school that hurts animals? A psychopath with a friendly face. Perhaps there is a way to blackmail her for her activities to help you undermine Megami. Or show off evidence of her “extracurricular activities” to Ms. Kamenga of the student council. Perhaps her love for animals will cause discord within the student council due to the activities of another of its members. When infighting has reached its peak, that’s when you will strike.

There are other options here as well. For example Megami rides to school in a helicopter. Perhaps you can learn a thing or two about the mechanics of Helicopters and sabotage the engines in some way. When they take off, the helicopter will crash and burn and no amount of training will protect you from burning. Or perhaps booby trap the helicopter port if possible.

Another option would be to somehow get into contact with Megami’s younger brother, Kencho Saikou. Kencho learned early in his life that he is nothing more than a backup to his older sister, Megami. In the event she dies, abandons her duties or is otherwise incapable of running Saikou Corps, he would be able to lead the company in her stead. So what is there to do? Kencho desperately wishes to escape his sister’s shadow and perhaps someone can be there to fulfill his wishes. Perhaps an alliance can be made between Yandere\-Chan and Megami’s own brother. Kencho wants Megami’s position, Yandere\-Chan wants the rivaled love of Senpai. 

Conclusion: Join the student council and undermine the powerbase of Megami. A full frontal – assault isn’t going to work. Or befriend her younger brother and stab her in the back. What emperor palpatine did in ten years, we have to accomplish in 10 weeks.

Well there you have it. Sorry for being so long lol"

A lot of them are forgettable  - for obvious reasons (they're supposed to be). But some are just too good to let go of. 

Which ones were your favorites? I'm not necessarily talking about just the physical appearance of the disguise, but the personality that goes along with it.

For me, there are only two Phillip personas that matter: Clark and Jim. The meek internal investigator who becomes Mr. Martha and strings her along with the promise of a family and freaky sex positions.. and the creepy as hell pot connection who kind of looks like the special olympics steroid dealer from South Park that grosses us all out with Kimmy. 

Elizabeth was a much harder choice. I didn't really like many of her characters. Patty, who becomes pals with Young-Hee then nails her husband. Michelle from AA.. Mostly forgettable. But season six brought us her two best: Stephanie, the nurse and my personal favorite of all time - Wendy the flirty gal who charms Vice President Blythe and poor Jackson the hapless senate intern.

The turquoise robe I wore clung to my body following each curve before cutting off shortly after my butt cheeks. I had bought this for my husband years ago, it never got the use it was supposed to. My black hair curled it's way down my neck stopping just after my shoulders, leading the eye down my neck and into the deep cleavage that the partially open robe displayed. My breasts were larger than they were when I was young, and hung heavy on my ribs from years of gravity and having a child. My hips were wider, my ass a little bigger, but I still thought I looked great. It made me wonder why my husband was out fucking some 20 year old at the moment.

I discovered two weeks ago through his phone that my husband had been having an affair with some college intern from his engineering firm. I was devistated when I found out. We had gotten married when I was 18, a year after having our son Marc. He was the only man I had ever slept with, apparently I wasn't his only. I knew things weren't great, we hadn't had sex in 6 months, but I never thought it would come to this. I got a lawyer and began getting things in place for a divorce, but I still found myself angry, wanting revenge. Then tonight happened.

My son had invited his friend from school to stay the night. He was cute, and obviously had a thing for me. I spent the night teasing him, having a few glasses of wine and bending over to show my cleavage. It had already begun to arouse me before I came up with this idea. 

Nervously I turned off the light and tip toed to the guest room in which he was sleeping. My hand shook as I turned the door knob and slunk in the room. The TV was on but was nothing but a black screen, I'm guessing the end of a dvd. My breathing quickened as I made my way to the guest bed. I was more nervous than I thought, but already I could feel the heat growing between my legs. Undoing the tie on my robe I let it fall to the ground exposing myself before crawling into the bed and on top of my young lover.

I'm tasked with building a system for information sharing in sharepoint. I'm just an intern, so it doesn't have to be an all flashy system.

I just have a question.

I want to make a folder for the managers, with information about the employees.

Can I assign 1 person to have acces to a 1 particular file? I don't want the managers to see information about eachothers employees.

So it should be something like this:

Folder 1                    File  1  -&gt; only acces for one manager 
                                File  2  -&gt; only acces for the other manager

Folder 2                   Acces for everyone, general information

Folder 3                  Personal folder, contains a different file per user

Is this possible?

https://imgur.com/a/RFNz9pg

If you go through some of my older posts you’ll see that my skin was pretty good up until now. My routine while here (I had to scale down quite a bit):

Cetaphil gentle cleanser
Pixi Glow Tonic (PM)
Garnier moisture bomb gel moisturizer 
Neutrogena Dry Touch SPF 60 sunscreen (AM, shit ton of it and constant reapplication but already been sunburned despite not even being white)
Glossier Balm Dotcom Rose on lips - my one luxury. 
I don’t wear any makeup. 

Here are the ‘lifestyle changes’ I’ve undergone since coming here:
Drinking a lot more water (but also sweating a lot more, it’s 30 degrees Celsius and humid af)
Bug spray :( I know it’s bad for my skin but so is malaria 
Eating a lot of fried foods (they are a large part of the diet here)
Less vegetables (salads are not safe to eat because of the water they’re washed in, and they don’t eat a lot of cooked vegetables here)
As a result, a lot more fruit (oranges, bananas, passionfruit, papaya)
The tap water when taking a shower or washing my face is probably quite different from back home
A lot more walking outside
Less processed food (chips, cookies etc.)
Taking weekly mefloquinone prophylactically for malaria 

I’m kind of stuck in terms of buying products for right now, and I’m limited in what lifestyle changes I can make as well, because obviously my health (and not contracting typhoid/malaria/whatnot) is first priority. But I am READY to start fixing my skin when I get back. Please throw your product rec’s at me, and let me know how you’ve dealt with the impact of a different climate on your skin. A couple things to keep in mind: I am 21 and a student so I’d prefer budget friendly products (but at this point I’m willing to shell out up to $100 for a HG product because I’m getting desperate) and I live in Canada where a lot of things like Stridex aren’t available, so if you know where to get a product that’s helpful too. :)

8kf0gb,6,2018-05-18,Finally opening up,GreenRedPanda,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8kf0gb/finally_opening_up/,"Hey everyone, 
I have no idea how long this going to be because it is the first time I have ever posted something somewhere on my situation. So please bear with me. 

First of all I want to say that I am not blaming Cannabis for who I am, but I am blaming myself for choosing to smoke every night. It is not the only thing going wrong in my life - I am obese, 140 kg at 180cm (always have been the big kid) - no self-confidence what soever and therefore never had a girlfriend in my entire life - have not talked to my father in 3 years.. the list goes on. It all comes together and as much as I love getting high I do not want to live on stand by for the rest of my life. Even now I am thinking back to the good times I have had with weed and friends or even with weed without friends, though I know that it has also cost me so many experiences because i would rather be at home smoking then exploring the world. 

I am turning 27 in the Summer and I have been a daily smoker for around.. (there the problem starts - I actually do not remember when I started smoking daily) I guess it has been 9 years now. What I can say for sure is that it became more ever since I started university in the Netherlands, where as you all know supply is unlimited. Throughout these 9 years, the longest time I did not smoke was 1 month, here and there trying to quit but always starting to smoke again after a few weeks. It is not like I smoked all day, but there were week long phases when I would.

Just like the last three weeks up until 3 days ago, when I realised that if I want to pass my master courses this semester I have to change something.  In these phases I just zone out of life / don't see people unless it is something I have to attend / do not study - basically just wasting my time. All I do is binge watch some stupid TV shows. I guess this my own form of escapism. Before the last phase of ""allday-erryday"" I had a solid few weeks working out, living healthy - and just toking up at night to unwind. But as this last relapse has shown I can't be the ""productive healthy stoner"". 

I have gotten by with this way of life so far, and last year was going good even as a daily smoker. I did some prestigious internships and the toking would not affect my performance, except for me knowing that I could  do better if I had not smoked up. Similar situation now. I know am not stupid but I feel like I am wasting so much of my potential. 

Due to being the person I am, I am always extremely self conscious. I hate that version of the person who I have become. Even though I am aware of my good qualities, they are outweighed by actions (i.e wasting my life away with getting high). I feel like I have two people living inside of me. One who dreams big and wants to have a nice life, a family and all that and then one who is like the devil in your ear, telling me yeah you will get all that - Start tomorrow. Unfortunately Dude#2 always wins. I constantly live in this liminal limbo where I know what I do is harmful but I do it anyways telling myself I will get around to start eventually. 

The main thing that is troubling me when I stop smoking weed are the dreams. I have had terrible dreams about this unresolved issue with my father, which i do not know how to resolve as I straight up have nothing but hatred in me for this man. I tried talking to a therapist but that is not for me. So I used MJ to medicate myself in addition to using it as relaxer helper. 

Tonight is going to be the THIRD night completely sober and I know that I am going to dream again, like last night, which makes me want to go get some weed now.  But I realise that smoking weed makes me just run away from that and does not let me face my many many many issues that I have with that personality of mine. 

I know this was all very specific, but maybe some of you see yourself in myself. I want to quit for good this time (and even now while I am writing this - that second person is telling me how nice it would be to kick back and relax with a joint tonight)

I have never used a forum like this to get support and I have never been completely honest about myself with anyone. Even now there is more I could share but I feel like I have rambled on enough. I am thankful for any tips you lot might have for me. 

Phew, this wasn't easy writing it all down and coming face to face with everything. I could really use some support. Thanks"

Cultural Festival Arc Thoughts,LuckyChi7,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8kfhmj/ua_cultural_festival_arc_thoughts/,"Coming off from the Internship arc which had a promising start up until they got the base particularly after the Red Riot and Mirio stuff where it really got pretty underwhelming as a whole. The Cultural Festival Arc I was kinda curious to see where it could go, and now more than likely it's finally finished with this latest chapter.  So then what are my thoughts on it? 

I will say it's not an earth-shattering arc that changes the scope of the story. However, I will say the arc was definetly a lot of fun, and very down to earth when it came to The Gentle Criminal and La Brava respectively. I also really appreciated how unique and engaging Kohei made the fight for Izuku vs Gentle and La Brava that was to me the biggest highlight of the entire arc was their fight, and ultimately their characters in particular, and how they were able to connect Deku to Eri &amp; Gentle to La Brava.  I also really appreciated that Kohei didn't just make them you're typical bad guys it was all about popularity through views which was unique in many ways The Culture Festival in some ways did feel somewhat brushed off, but the point was represented in these last couple of chapters which works especially when we got the flashback for Jirou and her decision into being a hero or a Musician.  It also does come to showcase The Gentle Criminal and La Brava could more than likely play a role in the future of the series. 

So overall in terms of rating (as of right now), I will say its a Good+ to arguably a Great.

8kfkez,1,2018-05-18,Milady/Ache,Bioman79,CharCreations,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharCreations/comments/8kfkez/miladyache/,"**Name/Alias:** Milady Marks/Ache

**Age:** 17

**Physical Appearance:**

Milady/Ache is a girl who got blessed \(or cursed\) in the appearance department. She has a pretty face with a small mole under her left eye, and full red lips. Her eyes are bluish\-green, and radiate a sort of enticing coldness from looking at them. She has B cup breasts and a young, attractive body. Her arms and legs are rather thin though.

**Mentality:**

Milady/Ache is very bitter and cold to the world around her because of her trigger. She is slow to trust and even slower to believe she is not wanted by somebody for some reason, whether it be for her body or her powers. Those she do trusts are few and far between, as she was betrayed by the organization that she trusted most of her life to. She is also very slow to become intimate with.

**Backstory:**

Milady wanted to be a nurse when she was younger, and worked hard to get an internship as an aid at a hospital. However, her patients were often uncooperative and temperamental, with one in particular being prone to seizures and tantrums. One night, when this patient was being particularly restless, Milady got desperate, and started holding him down in hopes he would stop. That was when she triggered, and her power activated. However, she underestimated how potent her power was, and rendered the man brain dead from all the energy she sapped from him. The hospital blamed her for the patient's death, and she was thrown out of the hospital, while her parents were terrified at her new abilities and disowned her. Desperate and without many roads to turn to, Milady became Ache, and started committing petty crimes to get enough for herself to survive.

**Resources:**

Milady/Ache has about 100 dollars in personal money to spend on herself. She's not exactly thrifty, and only has on herself a pair of gloves, a mask, clothes to help herself blend in, and her costume.

**Alignment:** Villain

**Equipment:**

Ache has access to a stolen phone, a stolen wallet with 100 dollars in it, a crowbar she stole from a construction site once, a pair of combat boots she stole from a soldier, some thin gloves to keep herself from sapping every person she touches, and some clothes for her costume.

**Specialization:**

Given her background as an aid in a hospital, Ache is well\-versed in medicine and medical treatment. She prefers that her ""patients"" be cooperative as much as possible when she works, as despite having a good knowledge of how to operate in theory, she hasn't had much practice working on people.

**Power:**

Ache has the ability to sap the energy or strength from anyone she comes in contact with. Theoretically, she could drain even Alexandria dry of her strength and leave her little more than a helpless living skeleton with skin and withered muscles. However, this comes at the cost that she **MUST** maintain physical contact with her target for the entirety of the time she is sapping them. If she loses contact, the strength or energy of the target rapidly returns, and she runs the risk of being on the receiving end of one \(or a few\) pissed off parahumans. Also, her power does not take the strength or energy of her target to make it her own. Despite this, her power has lethal potential, as her first target, the patient who died, demonstrates. It also takes her about 20 minutes to drain a healthy human being to the  point their heart can no longer pump blood through the body, effectively killing them. The amount of strength or energy returns at the same rate Ache maintains contact with the target \(e.g. 1 minute of contact requires 30 seconds to recover\). In order to incapacitate someone, Ache has to maintain 30 seconds of contact. However, for every 2 seconds she maintains contact, it takes 1 second for her target to recover once contact is severed.

**Versatility:**

Although she can only affect two targets at a time given how she can only affect those she is in physical contact with, Ache's power is surprisingly versatile. It can be used to drain power from a power source like a battery, weaken a strong opponent, or weaken a barrier like a wall.

**Example:**

Ache watched the wave of bobbing bodies rub against each other as music pounded against her eardrums. The shifting lights didn't do her eyes any favors as well. But she wasn't here for a good time. She'd never have one of those again. No, she was here because she needed money.

""Hey honey,"" a voice shouted over the music at her. She looked up to see a brute of a guy standing over her, a sick smile plastered across his face. She looked him up and down. His clothes were too average for anything but a simple guy looking for a decent fucking. Not like she'd give him even a decent job, but it was unappealing to say the least.

""Not interested,"" she said as she began to walk away. That's when he grabbed her by the wrist.

""Come on, baby, I promise it'll be fun,"" He said as he leaned in for a kiss.

*Fine,* She thought. If he was that desperate. Ache pressed her lips up against his forcefully, drawing the breath out of him, but he pressed back in just as quickly. Hook, line, and sinker. She felt her power sucking out the strength in his body, his knees growing weak as she grasped him around the neck and forced the contact to last. After about 30 seconds, he was out cold. She kept contact just a little longer to make sure, and then let him drop like a weight to the ground, limp. She reached into his pockets and began rummaging around until she found what she wanted: A wallet, ID, and some spare cash. She stashed the money into her pocket and began to walk out. She had reached the door when she heard a table fall. Probably the same asshole she'd just sapped trying to get back up. She rushed out the door and headed off into the night."

It’s as simple as that.

Long before I knew what the fuck the law of attraction was and before I embarked on my spiritual journey, I was periodically depressed and anxious. BUT even amongst it all, I was able to manifest a lot of the things that I wanted into my life, and really amazing things at that (prestigious college and professional school acceptances, scholarships, and internships). At the time I received these things, I chalked it up as sheer luck, but a week or so ago, I finally realized that even though my mindset was not at its finest at the time, there was a little voice deep down that told me that I was going to get what it is that I wanted. I sometimes would even tell myself that everything was going to work out the way I wanted it to and when I needed it to, and everything would fall into place months later like clockwork. Regardless of what I said or how I felt, I BELIEVED that it was all going to happen. 

I’ve seen so many post of people asking if this tool is working, what techniques work or don’t work, why they are not getting what they want, etc., etc. I used to be there too when I first discovered and utilized LOA. I would use technique after technique but I always found myself not getting what I wanted, and after that hitting rock bottom in my life. I use to chalk it up to doubt; that if I hadn’t doubted myself, then I would have gotten what it is with ease.

But when I was looking back at my life before LOA I realized that I doubted myself ALL. THE. TIME. And yet I still got what I strongly desired. 

So that is why I say all of this to say that it doesn’t matter what you do or even what thoughts are running through your brain. If you believe in the fact that what you want will manifest, then it will. If you don’t, then it won’t. You are going to have doubts. You are going to have negative thoughts. You are human. The problem is not having these thoughts, or having the doubts or feeling scared. The real problem is not believing that what you want is going to manifest simply because you asked for it, or not believing that everything will fall into place. You don’t have to do any more than just believing in order to manifest. That’s it!

Of course it’s easier said than done. We are mostly of the belief that we have to do some physical work in order for a favorable result to come about, and to do nothing for a negative result to come about. Yup, the vast majority of people have this belief. I hate telling people what to do, but here it goes: GET RID OF THIS BELIEF! Get rid of it, especially if it is not doing you any favors. Because you can do all the work until the crows come home, but if you don’t believe that the outcome that you want is going to happen, then it most likely won’t. 

So think positive thoughts and meditate because it helps you feel good. Visualize about your specific person because it makes you feel good. Study for that test because of the satisfaction that you feel when working for workings sake or when learning for learning sake. But don’t do those things to get somewhere, because if you don’t believe that what you want will happen no matter what and at the time that you want it or need it, then you are simply just playing a losing game. 

You can believe every day or once a week. You just have to. Because from there, you are able to have faith. And when you have faith, you let go. And when you let go, what you want will have no choice but to manifest. 

TL;DR No matter what just BELIEVE! "

8kfzoi,18,2018-05-18,[Long / Rant] Sensing a loss of purpose.. but MGTOW has set me free...,Born_Leader,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/8kfzoi/long_rant_sensing_a_loss_of_purpose_but_mgtow_has/,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

Since I was younger, I've also done what I was told, believing in my parents and what society at large tells me.  As an Asian immigrant, I was pushed to:
- Study / work hard
- Do well in college
- Get a good paying job
- Find someone, get married
- Spit out some kids

So, I did study hard in a relative ""meh"" high school (below a 5 out of 7 at best)... and only got into a bottom tier engineering college, albeit for free / full ride.

I did do well in college, where I:
- Almost got a 4.0 GPA in an aero-mech engineering degree
- gained 3+ years of actual internship experience via 35+ hours workweeks, in 2 different engineering interships before I graduated, designing products (i.e. not unrelated work)
- ran an honor society &amp; organized events (i.e. I'm not TOTALLY socially awkward)
- dated 2 girls, 1 for 4-5 months in freshman year, another in senior year for about a year. (so, I'm not hideous, maybe?)
- supporting my parents financially (i.e. they would have eventually been homeless if I did not contribute).

All sounds great and grand right?

So, I graduate.. and guess what? ""No job for you"" - since I didn't have my citizenship yet... (I have it now, but I digress)

I ended up staying at where I interned and was offered $48k... where my peers in the yesteryears earned $60-65k/yr + sign on bonuses, and they had less experience / worse grades.

---

Eventually, I did find another place 18 months later, offering $70+k... so I guess it just took some time, but then my boss sold his business... and long story short, I decided to start my own business over the next 12 years with a partner.

Things have been.. interesting business-wise over the past dozen years... we grew from $0 in sales to $1mm, but then saw it fall to $550-600k in the 08-09 crisis.  We survived, at the cost of having no paycheck for 3-4 years to myself...

I finally got the courage to start taking risks again in '13, and bought my 1st duplex.  Bought another duplex in '16 with big help from my parents and brother.  The main business expanded nicely since, and we've been able to create nearly 10 jobs.  I've also started investing in larger properties (I now partially own/manage 78 units), organizing meetups (i.e. doing public speaking), running a side web business with a friend of mine that I started recently, etc.

I've also been going to the gym regularly, and am in good shape (short of 6', 190#).

So, now I'm in a better spot, and finally achieved my long term goals of:

- Financial: cleared $250k reportable income last year on my tax return.  I can actually retire with the passive income streams I'm setting up in another 4-5 years, unless I decide to have kids / increase expenses.

- Social: Can easily engage new people and handle public speaking at events once a week, every week, for 11 out of 12 months in the year

- Health: Can finally do pullups (8+ in a row), learned how to ride a bike finally last year, and am taking better care of myself.

---

So, what's the problem, you ask?

The ""Find someone, get married"" part was eluding me.  I'm certainly no chad, and in reflecting on my life in the past several days... I have to be totally honest, every interaction that I had with females - other than family members - have been absolute proof of Briffault's Law.

As full disclosure, my last/current/on-n-off-again relationship is over 10 years old... and without going into too much detail, she can't have kids (and yes, I tried.. no dice), but I'm hesitant to just give that up and leave because I do feel comfortable with her (and vice versa).  She's hinted several times that she's fully expecting me to leave one day since she knows I want kids and she can't have them... but so far, I've not been inspired to go after anyone... (nor have I felt the need to venture out and find someone else, with my busy schedule).

(To be blunt, I do contribute quite a bit financially to the old gf, but it's a reasonable, non-obscene amount... So, it's a... relationship of convenience.  She gets what she wants in terms of support, and I get companionship and help.)

What I find funny though is that the ONLY time someone is interested is AFTER they learn about what I do / how much I make... but I make it a point to NEVER / rarely dress up / act rich.  I'm a T-shirt + jeans kind of guy.  I rarely let new people know that I own my own company, etc.

---

On the rare chance that I do meet someone, here's how the cycle goes after meet some girl and am attracted to girl:

Scenario A:
- Get to know girl.. and her baggage / problems
- Attraction to girl wanes, subsequent return to old gf follows

*OR*

Scenario B:
- Get to know girl.. and attraction grows more
- Ask girl out, declines.  I move on :p
(I'm not some guy that will hang around and be friends, sorry... too busy to be a beta buck!)
 
---

The problem now I feel is, to be blunt, I'm getting older.  I'm not sure if it's the wisest decision for me to just stay in a holding pattern, but after taking a look at:

1. Only a HANDFUL of guy friends I know are happy with their marriage.  95%+ of everyone else is MISERABLE.

2. Because of my position, I'm honestly afraid of false #metoo accusations.  It's already happened to me twice in my 20s, done by girls ""just for kicks"" - I thankfully either had plenty of witnesses that contradicted the story otherwise in 1 case, and in the other case, the accuser was a known liar by tons of people (and I'm generally known as the good guy).  For that reason, I'm never found at bars / single-mingles... and would only show up accompanied by others (both guys and gals).

3. I've tried my hand at online dating, but because I have NEVER emphasized my wealth/status/position, it's an absolute crapshoot, where the odds are good, but the goods are odd.  I did meet and connect with someone YEARS and YEARS ago... no one since then.  Most 30s chicks are looking for a bailout, and I already have that / don't need to be an ATM again, sorry.

---

Even on the last couple dates / attempts (and I emphasize the attempt part):

Girl A. Went out with a model-type girl.  Blonde, pretty, the stereotype.  Unfortunately, she knew about my assets already, but whatever, was looking just to hang out.  She invited me over to her apt, was ok with me massaging her, we held hands, went to dinner... and when I went for the kiss close, she backed off and seemed absolutely offended.  Haven't seen her again.  Now I realize she just wanted to get a free meal and stall for time (she owes me some money.)

Girl B. Asked out another girl that I met through a network event.  Everything was going great via text, and she even invited me to go over to her apt.  I was moving around the same time / away from the old gf, and she even helped me find coupons to Bed Bath Beyond to save some bucks on the move.  Then, no response from her.  I found out a week later that, as she puts it ""she found a guy online.. not the type of guy she typically dates, since he has tattoos and all, but she wanted to try something different.""

---

So, I started coming to the realization of the following facts:

- A. The one commonality between all of the above scenarios involving women is... me (more particularly, my looks).

- B. I've never had issues with talking with people (men or women), striking up a dialogue and continuing a conversation... so I don't think it's any awkwardness (I've gotten over that, I believe.)

- C. I've been working out (I can even bounce my pecs!) so I'm in good shape / better than most guys.

- D. However, no matter how hard I try, how much I work out, my face is simply ugly, and unattractive. :D

- E. So, in order to find / rope someone in, I would have to ""show my cards"" - but then they're not liking me for me.

===

My dilemma now is simply living with the fact that I'm totally unattractive and undesirable in the looks department - which is an absolute pre-requisite for any relationship.

So...how do I get past my biological desire to find someone, form a family?
^^ This is the part I struggle with he most ^^

I've pushed myself to the limits and beyond... whether it was school, work, or health... I have more wealth and health now than I ever did before... but there's are just soooo many better looking guys, born with natural looks that go far beyond my own.  No amount of physical training would ever change or close the gap there.

I realize that now... it was made painfully obvious to me by Girl B.. it simple, undeniable proof - to discover that no matter how hard I try, I would never be able to NATURALLY attract women to like ME for ME... doesn't matter if I'm a millionaire, well-dressed, or well-spoken, well-educated.

So that's when I started poking around TRP... then found Incels... and eventually.. MGTOW.

The funny thing is... I've found you guys through others commenting how they couldn't understand how men could ""live alone and ignore women..."" but all of you here (and I now) know, DON'T WE!

It's just pure, cold logic.

Having read through so much of the material here... it just... makes logical sense.  Sure, it may not FEEL very good at first, but after seeing the stories of divorce/alimony/child-support rape first hand and through other friends... it's the logical choice.

While I admittedly am still semi-attached to someone, I'm slowly re-programming myself, and see what the logic has done for you guys can also do for me...

Now I know, if I simply let my mind be logical - as per my engineering training - I know that the differences in feeling inadequate vs. the Chads of the world and my other #firstworldissues would disappear.

I have to say... it feels pretty good.  I'm quite pleased with the results. :)

---

I do have my down moments though, where the thirst comes back every once in a while... but how do you guys deal with it?  What do you guys do to deal with these... Feelings?!

I'm open to suggestions and whatever help y'all can provide!"

I essentially would like one strong enough to do independent work on if I am not at home, but I don't need the most expensive one since I have my desktop. I don't wanna cheap out or have one ""to start with"" since I'm kind of past a point of being a rookie and have to hit the job market soon.

I’m just bracing for the inevitable. I’m sure 5 minutes into the game it will be pretty clear to the BVB staff that #14 in gold could dominate in the Bundesliga but I’m allowing 40 more minutes for the transfer to go thru and not interrupt the run of play. 

I don’t know too much about how German teams handle their business but if there isn't some intern named Hans packing up Kaye’s locker for the flight back before he’s off the pitch i would be surprised. They probably won’t even wait for him to change boots before its back to LAX. Go on son there are Pokals to win.

As for us, we’ll likely see a lot more Atuesta and whoever we buy with the €100 million we get from the sale of MAK. Any thoughts?"

First off, I hope it's okay to ask for help on this sub.  

I used to own these Jordans roughly 8 years ago. I wasn't and still am not that hard into sneakers that I know specific attributes or names of shoes, so all I have to go by is how I remember them and that they were definitely Jordans.
So, they were completely black, except for a small portion of the sole, which had like these colored blocks. Those were red, blue, yellow and green iirc. I don't remember whether the bottom side of the sole was colored aswell.
The rest was pitch black, there was no white or grey in them.
Also, I remember the shoes to be rather 'heavy' for lack of a better word. Kind of like boots.
I'm located in Germany and bought them online through a German streetwear shop (Don't have any mails from that order, I checked) if that makes any difference.  

Does someone here, by any chance, know which shoes I'm referring to? I would be glad to answer any questions to the best of my knowledge.
I really would like to own these again.  


Edit: As I wrote in the comments: I believe them to be Jordan 3 or Jordan 4. Just remembered they had those air bubble things.

**EDIT 2**: Ok, so I actually just stumbled upon photographs of me wearing the shoes. Before anyone judges me on their condition, they were pretty worn out at the time and I used them as work shoes for an archaeological internship I was doing then.

- *Currently I have a Logan x Pepper RP involving time travel, a Tony x Pepper RP prior to The Avengers, and a Raven x Erik (may become Raven x Logan in time) RP. I love the RPs I have going but I would love one or two more stories because I am on such a MCU kick.*

- *I tend to reply two to four times a week, depending on how I feel and how much time I have. Other duties include taking care of my parents, chores, work and an online course in teaching abroad. So posts will not be immediate. I have other priorities but that does not mean I don't take writing or the partnership of writing seriously. The more we communicate our goals and interests for the future of the story, the more likely it stay alive and we both remain interested even if the pace is slow.*

- *I prefer Reddit PMs but I can go with Discord or Google Docs as well.*

- *I play females and males so while I am seeking a male partner, I am capable of doubling or tripling up on additional roles.*

- *Generally I can give anywhere from three to eight paragraphs. Three is the minimum I give and take but I like writing more. And I have no issue waiting days or even weeks if the post is more thoughtful and epic, than one thrown together in haste.*

- *Finally, mature themes are probably going to arise but I don't make a big deal about them. I'd prefer to have someone who is old enough to handle darker topics but who doesn't want to push them onto me constantly.*

- *Below I have outlined characters I am capable of playing. They are listed in order of both experience and interest. I will outline my vision for the character and then the male characters I would want someone else against them and how I see those dynamics playing out. I am open to other suggestions. We can plot together and see what we both want to try.*

- *And this is all pertaining to the movies and tv shows, sadly I cannot compensate much for not being aware of the comics or outside information. To me it's too much to really dig into so I would like us to stick to the movies and shows if possible. Thank you.*

**Characters I can play:**

- - -

**Pepper Potts:** *I see her as being outspoken and bold. She has worked for one of the most difficult people in the world. She came from a small town with loving parents who secretly wish Pepper worked elsewhere but they cannot deny how their daughter's hard work paid off. Pepper makes sure her parents don't have to work another day in their lives. She gets things done and she is wildly independant. Her social life is nonexistent as she's poured her life into bettering both Stark Industries and Tony Stark himself. Dating has been pretty much cast aside as she works on her career. She believes Stark Industries can be a global force for good. She has even taken steps to learn self-defense and firearms from Natasha. Pepper Potts is a woman who is always in control, knows what she wants and doesn't let anything stop her from achieving her goals.*

**Suitable Matches:**

- **Tony Stark:** *He was her boss for many years. They know each other rather well. Pepper has always held a soft spot for him, despite the many headaches he has caused her. He has taken steps to better himself, not wanting to die without having done more for the world than make money off of its old wars. Tony is protective and very smart, hopefully smart enough to see the amazing woman who has remained by his side for so long.*

- **Logan:** *A man who keeps people at arms length. He has been through a lot, he has lived through a lot. He could either fall back in time or Pepper could fall forward in time. Old or young is welcomed. Logan pretends that he's cold, hoping to not just protect himself but those he's hurt in the past. Pepper has dealt with difficult men before, she knows their walls will crumble eventually.*

- **Matt Murdock:** *Needing a lawyer is pretty vital when you run a company and Mr. Murdock had proven his heart is in the right place. He is brought to Stark Industries to help with the public image and ensure the Stark name isn't dragged through the mud. Matt's other identity is something Pepper perhaps stumbles upon and she takes it upon herself to accompany him in his pursuit of The Hand.*

- **Steve Rogers:** *By all accounts, Steve is a good guy looking to acclimate to his new life. And Pepper is hoping for a break from work, the stress prompting a needed vacation o her own. They come together in a small town, hoping to save a few people and remember who they are, not just what they have done. They have different strengths but can find comfort in one another, aware their past doesn't define them.*

- **Charles Xavier:** *He is a man who has many gifts. He and Pepper converge when mutants come forward to help in defending New York from an alien invasion. Charles decides to offer his services to Tony and Pepper, believing it vital for everyone with gifts to work together. While Tony is busy tinkering, Pepper and Charles grow closer as Charles begins to reopen his school and Pepper assists him, using grants from Stark Industries. Young Charles preferred here but I'm not picky.*

**Jessica Jones:** *I see her as young and snarky, able to cut down the biggest man with a snide comment. She loves her best friend and sister dearly, would do anything for Trish. Jessica is tying to give up drinking, trying to take on more cases, likely following the events of season two (or one) of JJ. She is slowly learning to open up to people. She is still damaged after being kidnapped and raped by Kilgrave, having been reduced to a pretty puppet under his control. Now she tries to reclaim her life and her freedom.*

**Suitable Matches:**

- **Logan:** *The two meet in a dive bar, both deciding to break up a fight. Both then decide to team up to take down a pharmaceutical company called Transigen. They uncover the truth about mutants being genetically modified and free the children inside, including a girl named Laura.*

- **Tony Stark:** *He and Jessica meet at AA. Both of them promised their respective best friends they'd try to do better. But upon meeting one another, they start to slip. They continue to bond over bottles of scotch and vodka. When caught they decide to stop dragging the other down and finally shape up and be better people.*

- **Peter Quill:** *When finally able to return to Earth, there is a lot of adjusting that has to happen for Starlord. He just so happens to rent an apartment in Jessica's complex and the two begin to form a strange friendship as she helps him adjust to the shitty life on Earth.*

**Trish Walker:** *She is passionate about her work, wanting to make the world a better place. She has done a lot of stupid things and she is hoping to move beyond her past as a child star. She was abused and manipulated. She then went on to try her hand at singing which didn't go that well and planted a wedge between her and Jessica. Now that they're reconnecting, Trish wants to move forward. Jessica has her business and Trish wants to get into more serious investigation pieces. Trish decides to be a different kind of hero, beginning to explore the catlike skills she's starting to develop.*

- **Kilgrave:** *Kilgrave is not dead. He has been resurrected and is considering a change in his path. He sees now that Jessica will never be his again. Not truly. He decides to seek out the one person who has been somewhat sympathetic to him (at least when he had been held captive and assaulted by Jessica), aka Trish Walker. He decides to make her his mentor in order to better himself. Will he bring out her darker side or will she bring out some good in him?*

- **Logan:** *After a long night of drinking and mild property destruction, Trish bails out Jessica along with someone else who was with her, a man named Logan. Trish and Logan get to know each other over coffee as a way him somewhat paying Trish back for her help. The two continue to see each other and when Will returns, Logan is there to help put him in his place.*

- **Steve Rogers:** *As she's following a tip for one of her radio programs, she crosses paths with Captain America. She ends up convincing him to let her interview him and they hit it off. When Trish begins to exhibit signs of having powers, Steve decides to take her under his wing.*

**Raven Darkholme:** *Depending on where she is in the timeline, I see her as a fearless warrior but not keen on leaving her human side behind either. She struggles to embrace both her mutant side as well as her human side. She wants to embrace who she is but believes the world will only use or mock or fear her. Raven is skilled in combat and enjoys used her shapeshiting to get what she wants. She has no qualms about lying to people if it means she and those she's close to, get what they need. Raven can be sweet just as she can be ruthless. Deep down she wants to live a quiet life.*

**Suitable Matches:**

- **Erik Lehnsherr:** *His views on the world may be skewed but he is the one person who sees Raven as she is and not who she could be thanks to her gift. Erik relies upon her companionship and together they take on the world. I'd prefer something between FC and DoFP or something during Logan's timeline.*

- **Logan:** *Set during the Logan timeline, Raven disguises herself as a nurse and helps Laura escape and unite with her father, Logan. Together she, Logan, Laura and Charles embark on a quest to save the mutant children. Along the way, Raven makes it her mission to destroy Transigen and its various labs throughout the country. She and Logan eventually run into cloned mutants of their fallen comrades.*

- **Steve Rogers:** *Steve believes there's no to Raven then meets the eye. He also doubts that she has truly turned her back on the world. But to Raven, the world has turned its back on her. Steve tries to help Raven seen that the country still needs people like her and him and that she is beautiful in her truest form. At the same time, Raven brings a bit of a wild side out of Captain America.*

**Karen Page:** *Karen is sick of staying on the sidelines. She decides to step up her investigations into the various crime syndicates of New York City. She begins to prowl around Hell's Kitchen and ends up following a few leads. In her past, to get through college she had to take part in a certain film industry. But she is trying to put those mistakes behind her and make a name for herself, hoping to carry on Ben Urich's legacy.*

**Suitable Matches:**

- **Matt Murdock:** *As Matt continues to be the Daredevil protecting Hell's Kitchen, Karen insists she helps him fight crime. Matt teaches Karen some self-defense and together they fight crime.*

- **Peter Parker:** *While Karen is lurking around the streets of Hell's Kitchen, Peter ends up saving her from some thugs. She decides to get to know him better they bond over their need to make the world a better place. Peter is attending college now and Karen offers him an internship at her newspaper gig.

8kgu2a,9,2018-05-18,I don't know why but Saryn 3.0 changed the way I have to play Saryn.,MentalGentlemen,Warframe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/8kgu2a/i_dont_know_why_but_saryn_30_changed_the_way_i/,"The way I played Saryn before wasn't the molt, spores, nuke repeat. I didn't really find the AFK playstyle that fun, I much preferred a roaming type Saryn still with a power strength build. What I would do is use the Pox With %100 chance toxin proc and since the spores would spread the toxin and it would make spores way more effective.(I'm not sure if spores in 3.0 still spread toxin if you know comment it) So I would just go around with the Pox and using my spores to umm ""Close the map due to space aids"" in my words and use carrier to pick up energy as I ran around the map. This worked pretty dam well on Defence, Survival, and Mobile defense, It worked kina fine on almost any other type of mission. But most of the time it was just fun seeing those huge fields of dmg numbers lagging my computer out and people asking ""what frame is that?"".

So when I saw Saryn 3.0 on prime time a couple of weeks about and they spouted such words as ""Infinite Damaged Scaling"", ""Corrosive instead of Viral"",  ""less power-hungry"", ""No more Spores on Molt"", and ""Only one spore active at a time"". I was honestly pretty excited since I didn't really play the AFK way this shouldn't affect the way I play but it did.

 First, the Infinite damage scaling WOO this seemed great more damage great! but since this changed the amount of damage that you do to an enemy when you put spores on or when they spread you can't nuke anything anymore at least in a timely manner. Don't get me started on the dmg scaling it is abysmal it takes so long to get to scale to dmg number that can even have an effect on the enemies that it feels like you could use a negative attack speed Fragor and it would be faster than spores(if your teammates don't kill them first).

 Second Corrosive instead of Viral with your spores. This I think was a cool change but yet again greatly reduces Saryns nuking potential by reducing the dmg she does. I think this would be a cool change instead of being a dmg nuker and turning her into a support nuker which is kinda cool if spores actually had range. Side note idk if its a bug or just an unlisted change but the range that spore spread when they're destroyed seems to be greatly reduced effectively removing her role as a nuker especially on missions where there are waves of enemies and your spores can't stay up long enough to scale to high enough dmg numbers to kill anything or spread.

Third less power hungry. I'm all welcome to using less energy but you aren't using less energy you're just casting spores less and intern using less energy but also doing way less damage. They didn't do anything to spores energy use when casting they just nerfed spores by only being able to cast it once or press it again to detonate. So basically made a nerf to spores into a ""buff"" for energy efficiency.

Fourth, No more spores on molt. Good Less AFK people.You can still nuke without spores on your molt but all the other problems cause her not to be able to nuke.

Fifth, Only one spore active at one time. This does affect her nuking ability but not as much as the corrosive switch. This change to only one spore active wouldn't be that big of a deal (for me at least) if the spores actually did damage and spread as far as they used too.    

 I'm, not a pro I've only got around 100 hours in Warframe and some of this stuff probably isn't right, but a few suggestions on how to return Saryn to her mighty megaton potential. First, you should keep it to where you cant cast spores on your molt. Second, make spores do viral procs again because that's what did most of the damage. It would be fine with me if they keep it so you can only cast spores once at at time. Bring the spreading range of spore back (if that was even changed)"
8kh0xa,2,2018-05-18,Should an internship provide software?,RCisaGhost,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/8kh0xa/should_an_internship_provide_software/,"After graduating a year ago and putting my dreams on hold to deal with temporarily raising a 12 year old child, I finally got an internship in graphic design. The pay isn’t terrible for what it is, and the work is remote but sounds interesting enough. 

I was wondering if it’s common practice to provide interns with the software they need, even if they’re working remotely on their own computer. I think it’s reasonable to expect them to cover the cost of software. They haven’t mentioned it one way or another and I already asked for a lot (a slightly later start date, a dollar over their offer that’s still in range of what they offered me that they declined). I’ll probably ask in person if it doesn’t come up but is it normal for remote interns to have to shoulder the cost of software? It’s about four hours of work so I’m kinda salty about it but maybe sucking it up is what everyone does. I just thought I would ask.

8kh2iv,2,2018-05-18,Thank you to everyone who talks to others about medical cannabis,TrickyRush,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/8kh2iv/thank_you_to_everyone_who_talks_to_others_about/,"It stops so much mental and physical pain without destroying lives.  It's insanity having only pills from the doctor that cause crazy symptoms with incredible w/d if you try to stop; or alcohol when those don't work and you end up mixing both and people end up dead.

There's no other option though.  Many have been to therapists for years and on many different prescriptins.  But at the end of the day the only thing that's instantly accessable is alcohol at the nearest gas station.  Cannabis is near impossible for me to find, which is insanly frustrating knowing so many in my town probably use it but the disabled can't find people who sell it like that.

I don't understand why I have to look to an illegal market for basic medicine, I don't want this to be the medicine that works for autism and nerve pain.  I'd do anything for it to be some random pill without stigma.

All people see is the recreational side.  No one see's the thousands who are stuck in beds that no one ever see's who have been asking for cannabis for years and no one listens.  Some people abused the medical system saying they needed it when they didn't and that made a ""cry wolf"" situation to a lot of people including children need cannabinoids.  

THC and CBD are just two of at least 113+ different ones to study.

I wish I had a friend where I could move and volunteer on a cannabis farm as an intern to learn and to get to a legal state.  This is just too bad knowing what stops pain and then having to worry about prison as a disabled person just trying to seek pain relief.  I don't want to die so much but I get desperate to make pain stop and I can't do it with alcohol anymore ever again.  I'm being pushed in a corner and it's torture and everyone says ""get help"" but never knows what ""help"" to get other than ""call the suicide hotline"" but I don't speak so I can't use a phone.  

Why can't I have low THC cannabis oil that doesn't even cause a high when it stops so much pain?  How much longer is it going to be like this?  Sometimes it doesn't feel like anyone is fighting for the disabled and veterans so thank you for treating cannabis first as a respected medicine."
8khinh,127,2018-05-18,My personal statement,tacticalmilk,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/8khinh/my_personal_statement/,"With applications being due soon enough, I thought I would post my personal statement I used to apply in the 2016-2017 cycle for those who might be interested in reading it. This sub was a HUGE resource for me when I was applying so I want to try and give back, if even a little bit. I got accepted to 2 DO schools and 1 MD so it probably isn't complete shit. 

I'm nearing the end of my first year at a US MD school and I am also happy to answer any questions you guys have to ask about academics, social life, etc. I'm going out tonight, but I will get to all of your questions at some point! 

Anyways, here's my PS:

As children, we are rarely confronted with our own mortality. Death does not exist for us; it is a foreign idea, barely in our periphery. This blissful ignorance allows a child to live and dream with impunity-- to believe they are invincible. But this is not always the case. The girl living with cystic fibrosis recognizes her transience all too well, and the boy who lost a parent knows just how fragile our lives really are. I was thirteen when my mother died after three years of living with cancer. It was the first time I stood face-to-face with human mortality. Death was no longer the antagonist of a fairytale, but a reality I had come to live with.


This newfound knowledge drastically changed the way I viewed medicine. My view of doctors changed from scary scientists, intent on hurting me, to a protector from death and disease. While my mother was sick, I had been exposed to numerous hospital visits and hospice care. The excellent palliative care the medical staff gave my mom and my family led to my aspirations to become a doctor. It showed me just how dynamic the profession is. Doctors not only excelled at understanding the human body, but also excelled at improving their patient’s quality of life. 


It was not until college that my desire to become a physician changed from a velleity to a passion. Shadowing in a pediatric emergency room gave me my first taste of a doctor’s day-to-day life. I watched as the doctor I shadowed diagnosed a young boy with croup, and taught interns how to recognize the disease. Immediately after, I saw her console the mother of a seizing infant. It was during this time that I witnessed just how diverse a physician’s occupation really is.


One particular moment will always stand out to me. A seven-year-old boy came in with a fractured tibia, and the orthopedic resident asked me if I would like to assist setting the fracture by holding the boy’s leg as it was wrapped. The task was relatively simple, but it was one that I did with great anticipation. Afterwards, I told the boy’s mother that she could come and take him home. I have never met a mother so grateful that we were able to ease her child’s pain. She did not understand my role as an observer, but the appreciation she had was genuine. For her son, it meant he would play football and run track again, but to her, the news meant that her family would be whole. Moments like this show me just how rewarding the profession is, and it shows me why being a doctor is the right track for me. The work done in the hospital goes beyond just what is done right then and there. A physician’s impact reaches far beyond the walls of their workplace by fostering a child’s potential and providing a parent with peace of mind.


The scope of a physician’s job has no horizon, for throughout the day a doctor must seamlessly tie together the skills of a detective, social worker, biologist, and teacher. Whether looking to enhance a patient’s quality of life, or educate the new generation of healthcare providers, each pursuit is virtuous and vital. I am eager for this chance to become a physician, and will face the challenges that await me with courage. Pursuing a career in medicine is an opportunity to create an impact in my community as a healer and a confidant; to provide end of life care to a dying woman, and preserving a little one’s childlike wonder.

8khqgk,23,2018-05-18,Why do ppl say nothing has happened this current arc and it felt like filler?,xasum0x,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8khqgk/why_do_ppl_say_nothing_has_happened_this_current/,"I mean can understand why some ppl would think that to a certain extent.  Nothing happened to affect the overall major plot,  but I feel like if you think this arc was filler,  you're ignoring the much needed closure to the Internship arc,  Horikoshi actually tackling the issue with the other departments in UA being upset at all the drama surrounding the school and Class A feeling responsible, Gentle and La Brava literally further showing how flawed society is and having good development, Dekus development as a fighter, and overall seeing Eri go from being this traumatized damaged girl who almost felt like a plot device and nothing more, to being able to finally smile for once on her life and have fun. In fact, that's the same for all the characters, to generally have fun after everything they've been through this year, to relax and enjoy themselves. Those 2 things is what drove Deku to desperately stop Gentle, because he understood how much UA went through and how much Eri went through, and how much this culture festival was needed. I'm not saying if you're not liking this arc your stupid or whatever, you can dislike this arc for numerous of reasons, but calling it unimportant filler is pretty ignorant and means you haven't payed attention or simply don't care about the type of plot points and characters that needed conclusion and what it overall means to these characters. And for me personally, I'm taking this time to enjoy these characters interactions with each other, not only because I throughly enjoy their characters, but because I know that Horikoshi wants the series to be more dark, and that this'll probably be one of the most wholesome things in the series until it concludes. Anyways, I just feel like getting this off my chest because I feel like recent events of MHA have just been getting so much push back from some ppl, a lah the shit happening now and the previous shit involving Shouto, Bakugou and gang having to look after the kids, and I just feel like it's ok to not like these events and find them boring, but to please try to understand what type of story Horikoshi is trying to tell and what the setting of this series is. It's literally set in a school, and Class A are full or hella realistic teenagers. They aren't child warriors like in Naruto who are gonna constantly fight and put their life in danger, nah they're just kids learning how to be heroes and about how society functions around them."
8kifz0,1,2018-05-18,Which loan first?,cloud12348,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8kifz0/which_loan_first/,"Hey everyone, this will be a long post but I wanted to include all the details to get opinions for my student loans.

Background: Currently on my sophomore/junior co-op (internship) term at my school and looking to where I should be putting my money towards. I make $1186.04 every two weeks and it seems like by the time I am done working I will have made $14825.50 to put towards loans.

Private Loans:

Sallie Mae: Principal: $40,812 Interest Rate: 10.625% Variable 1-month Libor Index (It hurts) Interest Accrued: $5,028.23

Wells Fargo: Principal: $22,467 Interest Rate: 10.24% Variable Prime Index (yea) Interest Accrued: $1,091.72

Federal Loans:

A: Principal: $5,500 Interest Rate: 3.760% Interest Accrued: $282.60

B: Principal: $6,500 Interest Rate: 4.450% Interest Accrued: $84.14


My Plans:

Option A: Throw all money at Sallie Mae loan and disregard the rest. It's the highest interest so paying this one down before touching anything else and letting the rest capitalize (assuming that I only have enough for this loan and nothing left for the rest). I would make less of a dent on the principal but I think I would save more money since it's like transferring my higher interest loans to a smaller one? (Is this correct thinking?)


Option B: Throw all money at Wells Fargo loan and disregard the rest. This would make a bigger dent in the principal since there is less accrued interest at the moment but I'm not sure if that saves me more over the course of the loans.


Option C: Mix?

Which of these options are the best or is there a different option that is better? I know that short term I think putting it all towards wells fargo would save me more on interest a year but I wasn't sure about the life of the loan if I would save more with option A and the capitalization since I definitely won't be able to pay them back until a few years after graduation. Thank you so much."

8kiph0,0,2018-05-18,My [21F] boyfriend [21M] of 2 years has never worked/volunteered a day in his life,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8kiph0/my_21f_boyfriend_21m_of_2_years_has_never/,"As a disclaimer, this is a throwaway account, and I've already posted to r/relationship_advice. I'm going to start with some background information, but please feel free to skip down to where I've asterisked! For the sake of this post, I'm going to name my boyfriend Adam.

My boyfriend and I first met in seventh grade. I had strong feelings for Adam, but he was in a relationship which lasted for about two years \(until freshman year of high school\). We progressively grew more and more distant until he confronted me in ninth grade to tell me that he liked me during middle school. The two of us became close again after his breakup, but we both eventually entered two long\-term relationships. \(Later, I found out that Adam was going to ask me out but was persuaded by a friend, who also liked me, not to do so.\) He mutually broke up with his girlfriend during junior/senior year of high school, and I continued dating my boyfriend throughout my first semester of college. Over winter break of freshman year, we met with two friends at a local eatery, and I realized how unhappy I was in my current relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend shortly after in late January and started talking to Adam while he was 5\+ hours away at college. He came home during spring break, and we hung out several times; he asked me to be his girlfriend when he came home after finishing his freshman year of college.

\* In the fall of 2016, Adam started his sophomore year of college but was struggling in his computer science classes. His mental health was getting progressively worse, and after coming home for Thanksgiving break, he simply couldn't deal with the course load anymore. \(I think it had something to do with the fact that he was 5\+ hours away from home and that he was missing me and his family.\) A week or so before finals, Adam admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital where he stayed for a few days. He was not able to complete his finals nor receive final grades for the semester. During winter break, he decided to take a semester off from college while he was attending weekly group therapy sessions as well as individual psychotherapy sessions. Adam and I were thankful that he decided to stay home because not only did our relationship thrive and blossom but also his mental health greatly improved.

After taking a semester off from school in the spring of 2017, I was a little surprised when Adam didn't want to work or volunteer over the summer. \(I'm an extremely conscientious student and have been working a part\-time job since my sophomore year of college. I've also completed an internship and will be working two jobs while interning this upcoming summer.\) However, I actively reminded myself that the academic trauma in the fall was still fresh and that he should focus on preparing for the fall semester at a local public college.

Now, let's fast\-forward to present day.

It has been about 1 and 1/2 years since Adam dropped out of his computer science program to transfer to a school closer to home, and he is about to start his junior year of college. For the most part, I would say that my boyfriend has been happy. He has continued his weekly group therapy sessions and has reported liking it, although he recently stopped individually seeing his psychotherapist \(which is not a decision I agree with.\) As far as school goes, I know for a fact that he does not regret choosing to come back home to complete his degree. However, Adam has not applied for any part\-time jobs, picked up any volunteer positions, or committed to any extracurricular activities at school, and I'm starting to worry because his resume is essentially blank. 

Although my boyfriend has no desire to partake in any activities at school or in the community, I understand that these two things are more personality\-based and that these won't make or break his future. Sure, I would like to see him be a little bit more involved, but volunteering and having an extracurricular activity won't directly contribute to his financial/professional success. With that being said, my biggest concern is that my boyfriend doesn't seem to be motivated to get a job, despite voicing his concerns about spending his dad's money. \(His dad makes $100k\+ a year as a CEO of a computer software company to solely support his family of four.\) I don't even think my boyfriend has applied for a job anywhere.

At this rate, I'm nervous about having a financially stable future with my boyfriend. \(Currently, I'm moving out of my parent's house into an apartment, and I've said to myself that I won't let him move in until he gets a job.\) I'm nervous about my boyfriend's chances of getting a job and getting into graduate school \(because he has said that he wants to get his master's\). I'm nervous about Adam's level of motivation and how that's going to play in marriage.

I've tried talking to my boyfriend about applying for a part\-time job at GameStop or other local video game stores, but he doesn't seem interested, even though he is a huge video game fanatic. \(Our mutual best friend has also tried talking to him with no luck.\) I haven't voiced my concerns about his professional future because I'm not sure how to go about it in a non\-threatening way, so any advice in that area would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: My boyfriend has never worked, volunteered, or been involved at school. He doesn't seem to be motivated to do any of those three things, and I'm nervous about the fate of our relationship. I'm looking for advice on how to talk to him about it and how to handle the situation moving forward."

I love someone man or women to make me give then consent forever. Their slave. Their pet. Too many people try to turn me into a mindless obedient slave. That is no fun. I'm into obeying every command and instruction as if they're perfectly reasonable requests or stuff like that. Ideally the request tap into something about my character's personalty. Other kinks are public sex, pet play, daddy/mommy play, making me a nudist, corrupting a religious girl.

I love playing new scenarios so I would like you to send me the scene in your mind already. I will share some of the things I have been sent and liked. Don't think these are your choices. You can try, but I do love originality. What I would love to hear is twist on these or completely new ideas.

Also make sure to make your title related to your scene.

Your slut's daughter: While I was away for college, you hypnotized my mother to be your sex slave and wife. She was so lost on your spell that she never brought me up. Well now I'm back for summer. You have a nice nudist wife always ready for your biding. You are not going to let me get in the way of that. You may make me join.

Stuck out of my house: I lost my key. My thankfully I have the nicest of neighbors and he will let me stay till tomorrow morning. I don't know what he is planing thou. If he gets what he wants I will never be leaving. How could I leave my daddy after all.

Finding my friend: A friend of mine has disappeared. She wasn't kidnapped, she told me she was leaving, no explanation. After weeks of trying to reach out, she tells me to come over she has a new home. She would love for me to meet her master. I look up an address and see it is a mansion. I can't resist but to accept the invitation.

My new personal trainer: This is what I needed to do to lose weight. A pesonal trainer. You gave me a dvd to watch so I know what to do. I don't remember what was in it anymore, but since I did I eaten better and worked out everyday. It is like you put a spell on me. Today you are coming for our first one on one meeting. I'm so exited.

Free use internship: The guys in the company were getting too stressed till the boss decided to make one of the female employees into a free use slut with hypnosis. Of course the other girls were hypnotize to think this was okay. Slowly every hot female employee was turned. Now you need more. Help Wanted. I apply.

The perfect saleswoman: Sex sells after all. Your business is not doing to well, but you have a solution. Me. You have made me into your slave and I'm willing to do anything to sell your product.

Group orgy: This is the vague one. I won't play more than one character at the time. I will respond as whoever your character is paying the most attention at the time. We will both play the other girls and the crowd. Still your words are truth, so where will you do your orgy. Are you a teacher in an all girls school, are you in a first class plane ride, yoga class? Anywhere you want.

Everyone is welcomed. Men, woman and futa's. (I will only play a women or a futa). Will love to hear from all you lovely people.

Please, don't be scared to pm me all of today. Also if you have tried before try before."

Things must have gone well as they offered me a part time job to stay on, which I accepted.  I don't think the pay is great, but the hours are VERY flexible and the environment is pretty laid back, which works fine for me with small kids.  I don't want to work full time for a few more years.

I just realized over the last few weeks that if I stay doing public work, which I am enjoying so far, that I am probably limiting my earnings and promotions potential over the remainder of my career without having the CPA.  Or am I?  I am new to all of this, even though I'm too close to 40 for comfort and am ten years out of school.  I never wanted to work in a Big 4 firm, but am interested in working at a larger local firm...but not at a clerk\-level position for the rest of my life.

Am I being naive in thinking that I could do fairly well without the exam?  I don't want to be a partner, don't want a super high pressure gig at all \- my husband already has that and with small kids we both don't want to work gigs like that.  Or do I have to bite the bullet and take the test?  I think I already know the answer to this but am looking for feedback from people with more first\-hand knowledge than me.

Side note: I do books on the side for very small, home\-based sole proprietors \- maybe I can leverage my public work into a larger version of that?

Thank you!"

Job description seems pretty general. Financial and Revenue reporting, budgets, reconciliations, preparing tax documents, getting coffee (lol), etc.

The pay is great for me, someone who's been absolutely shit poor for my entire life. Literally almost double what I made working on an ambulance.

Now, my question is pretty simple. 

How tough will it be for me to get an entry level job in public once I graduate if I don't have an internship with them prior? This job will actually continue for me throughout the remainder of my degree (about 1 year), so it'll be a good chunk of experience, but it's absolutely my plan to go public when I graduate and I need to make that a reality. 

I have the option of either graduating next summer or freeing it up for another internship and then going back in fall for my remaining like one or two classes. I'll also graduate with 150 either way. 

Thanks for any input. If it helps, I'm looking to go into public in WNY, Buffalo particularly. "
8km1bt,172,2018-05-19,What's your worst interview experience? Here's mine,orions_nipple,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/8km1bt/whats_your_worst_interview_experience_heres_mine/,"I go to what I feel is a pretty *meh* state school in the midwest, although among employers it's CS program seems to have a pretty good reputation. I'm a non-traditional student who has a *meh* gpa as well, between a B and B- average. I never put much stock in gpa, I also have a slight learning disability, and I don't really want to work for an employer who has such a hard line for GPA that they won't even look at **my multiple internships and projects**. That's my personal philosophy and values, I understand that others won't share them but this was the only time I was outright treated like shit by a potential employer because of it. 

My worst interview ever was with General Dynamics. Actually, my worst *two* interviews ever were with General Dynamics. I interviewed with them after approaching them at the career fair at my school. I think working for a defense contractor would be kind of cool and an interesting experience, and they asked me to come in the next day. I go in and the next 45 minutes is essentially the main interviewer *hammering* me over my gpa. Like, just reaming me over it. It wasn't even a discussion, he talked way more, and there wasn't a single CS or engineering question. I tried my best to stay positive but after a certain amount of time I just shut down and that was that. The one question that stuck out to me was ""How do you expect to be successful in your professional life if you're not successful in your academic life?"" 

Me being a glutton for punishment that I am, I approached General Dynamics again. Again, I made them aware of my gpa and asked them if we were actually going to talk about CS and not just my gpa, ""sure!"" they said. They said wrong. What was supposed to be a 60 minute interview lasted all of 20 minutes. Again, hammering me over my gpa to the point that I shut down, shook their hands, and left. No CS questions at all. I then got a very weird, cryptic email about how the interviewer ""saw promise in me"" and would like to interview me again sometime. Yeah, no thanks GD Mission Systems.

8kmeh0,1,2018-05-19,College semester that has made me depressed and anxious constantly.,mruiz18,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8kmeh0/college_semester_that_has_made_me_depressed_and/,"I cannot sleep, I don't stop hearing things being said about me. My gf has chrons disease and she suffers heavily from anxiety and bleeds heavily and goes through so much joint pain. Every turn I take, every thing that drags me down I let go of, but there is always something else waiting for me at every corner. 


Constantly goin on:

Let me start off with: I am a junior in college. This semester, rumors were being spread about my gf and lack of academic progress, and just general life topics blown up by a guy who she did not want to date. Her sister wanted her to date him, and after he was telling my gf sister these lies and her parents would also end up knowing. I also had a female friend who I realized liked me. I did not pursue. Turns out that after a few months of our relationship, the guy she turned down and the girl I turned down are together and trying to ruin our lives. 

Also, both of them are graduate teaching assistants. The female TA has lied to my gf professor and caused her final grade to drop by a letter. 

My extracurricular life:

I was vice president for a student organization. The president was a girl who I will name Tris. She dropped her position at 3AM, then she cancelled our travel accommodations to the annual conference we attend. This girl lied about me in the organization group chat saying that I have been bullying her and shut down all her ideas and never let her speak freely. When all the projects for the entire semester where ones she came up with, when for her election speech I revised it. And I even asked my gf to read for her because Tris was at an internship during elections. Something that the organization doesn't allow to do but they did this one time. For about 2 months the entire 90+ students of our org looked at me different. In the halls everyone turned away from me. She was a senior so all the senior class believed her partly because I did nothing to escalate the situation. I was the hot topic of my eng department even other organizations heard and talked about me. She told a professor who hates me and who has had a bad relationship with me since I began school. He does not like my success and grades me harder than all my classmates. And in class he literally walks around my station and avoids me, he also ignores me when I stand next to him and say I have a question. 

This professor also happened to be our faculty advisor for the organization. 

My work life:

While all this is happening I obviously have to work, I am a student researcher nanofibers. There is two labs that we primarily work in. Lab B has desks and some testing equipment. Lab A has machines to produce our nanofibers. When I was in the organization I was the member with the highest technical background and therefore I had a lot of work load with a company that we partnered with(the partnership was made before I was an officer the same semester). I had to complete a project that the president Tris accepted but did not know how to do. I told my boss that I would not be as available as I was before because of this role. She agreed. We had been working on a project for 2 semesters. It was a few months away from being a year when I told her this. At work my team composes of 2 graduate students and me. The two graduate students are always in lab B doing HW, reading, watching YouTube, and talking. Also they are taking 3 classes each. While I am taking 6 and juggling them along with my other life aspects as best I can. Suddenly one day I ask when we will work on a particular aspect of the old project we had been doing. They tell me that we are no longer doing that and that we will now have a new project. I talked to my boss after a few weeks go by of me going to lab B in between classes and nothing being done just sitting behind a computer. She tells me that there will be no work until my partners figure out some details about the current project. I stop going as often as I did and I went from making $250 every 2 week paycheck to $80. April is when I finally exited out of all my extracurricular activities. My partners also around this month would sign up to use equipment, I would show up at that time, and they would say that they won't be using it because lack of preparation. I would ask when they need my help to let me know, they agreed but never did, we share a group chat and they never communicated with me details of the project or why or what it changed to. My boss never emailed me or conducted the team meeting she promised me to go over details. Whenever I was at work they would be in Lab B. I would go for about 10 hours a week MAX and do just like everyone else in the lab, do hw, read and wait for my partners to ask me to do something. 

Now at work I am being asked why I put in hours when I have not done progress during those times in the lab. The whole semester my partners where working on our new project they never go the fibers they wanted. I went to work last week and in 4 days I made the fibers they wanted which they had been continuously trying to do for the past 4 months. 

My boss NEVER is at her office hours she hides in her husband's office so that students don't ask her questions. Now I have to meet with her and tell her why I put in hours when I did nothing just like everyone else and I don't know what to say. My boss is also never at work and one of the graduate partners is at an Internship so I know the majority of the comments if my attendance and work ethic has been made by someone I will name Juan, who is the partner who resented me the most because as an undergrad; Who isn't even in the same discipline as he is which is the same discipline our project is, have always produced so much results and such short amount of time because I don't treat Lab B like my personal hangout whenever I chose to show up. 

I don't know how to justify my actions of doing what everyone does "

Hello guys,

I took finasteride for about 1.5 years. While I had definite gains, I am now suffering from side effects with no future in sight.

I was balding since around 18 years old. Hair loss has greatly affected my confidence. So at 22 years of age, about a NW3, this is when I took the plunge and took fin. My dosage was 0.25mg a day as prescribed by my doctor here in California. In the 6\-8th month period, I definitely experienced some noticeable progress. I have this thing that catches all sorts of debris in my bathtub; I used this to monitor my hair shedding. While I didn't count the hair individually \(who does that\), it is evident that the clumps are much lesser in size. I also saw a substantial amount of tiny hair growing. However, during this period, there was also accompanying side effects. I noticed that erection was becoming more and more weak. Morning woods are becoming rare and if I had it, again, its weaker than what it was used to. I was also having memory and processing problems. During this time, I was also finishing my degree in Physics in Caltech. So during this semester, I had problems concentrating, meeting due dates, studying, and just an overall drop in my GPA during this semester\-\-from a consistent 3.8 to 2.9. I asked for advice from my doctor and including reddit \(big mistake tbh\). While my doctor didn't explicitly say to stop, he just told me that it is my choice to stop and that in his practice, permanent side effects are only about 5&amp;#37;. People here on reddit and other forums told me that side effects are normal in the first few months and will eventually get better. Fuck it, I was having great progress and even if my GPA in my last sem is only 3.0, it will only bring down my overall GPA to 3.5. So, I continued.

At around 1 year, gains are really visible. Like there's no denying that. I got compliments from my friends and gf, and I was able to rock more hairstyles that before\-\-for example I was able to do a faux hawk which I couldn't before. However, at the same time, more and more bad news. My GPA for this semester, which I thought I could get at least a 3.1, is only 1.8. I failed 2 classes. Sex with my GF was also becoming more and more rare. Like no sex drive at all! If I did, my dick would be as hard as a cheese string. It was really bad. But what really hit me the most was my academic performance. I only ended up with a GPA of 3.33. My dream grad school is just gone in just a year. No more Stanford, Harvard, or MIT. I would be lucky if would Berkeley even look at my application. My life at this very moment went to spiral of control. I also had job interviews during this time with very good companies \(Google, NVIDIA, Facebook, Squarespace\). Guess what? I bombed all of them. How ironic that I vividly remembered the times I blanked out during these interviews. This never happened prior; I had internships with Google and Amazon in my 2nd and 3rd year. FML at this point, I had suicidal/violent thoughts, and spent weeks and weeks in my bed. I was only taking fin like once a week during time or whenever I find time or get out of bed.

About 7 months ago is what prompted me stop taking fin, heck, even my life \(drank bleach, I know a shitty choice\). My gf of 7 years left me. Turned out she was fucking another guy behind my back. fuck. Can I blame her though? So yea, I tried to end my life. No good grad school and job prospects. I knew I could just go to a state college for grad school or work at a local start\-up but fuck that shit. I just stopped doing nor try anything at that point including fin.

Fast forward to today, about 6 months after I stopped taking fin, problems are still there and I'm not sure if it would get better. Currently living with my parents in LA. They asked me to see a doctor to treat my mental issues. Now I have to take a cocktail of antidepressants. And yeah, a busted stomach.

While I don't blame fin for the issues that I have right now, the only variable that changed prior to this nightmare was my falling hair and me taking fin. Maybe I am just one of the unlucky ones. Either way, fin definitely helps hair loss but it has side effects, at least in my case. I don't know anymore. Hope my story helps, I guess? Or not, whatever. Just carefully consider before taking in chemicals of any kind. FML.

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

Our dates always went well, never fought and we even kissed a few times. We’re talking for half a year now

Main story: Now lately we started having some fights over texts and we ran into the problem of being yourself. 2 days ago this girl texted me that she bought some pretty revealing jeans, showing half her ass. Now I’m not all about that, but acted like I was alright and that this is probably a joke. 

Some texts later and I asked her why would she want to wear it and she didn’t respond to me for hours (8 hours). I was boiling inside. I then asked if she was going to answer my question and then she told me that it was a joke. I said: Funny joke, but you can make jokes like that somewhere else (I was so mad and reacted instantly). She responded with: It’s a fucking pants, how can you get so offended by that, but I guess with you, everything is possible. I got furious. I was smart and didn’t react to that.

I was hurt after reading that and didn’t text her for a day. I was expecting her to say that she’s sorry or even something else like: hey, what’s up. I never ignore her so I guessed she took my hint. She didn’t. I then saw on her twitter (she doesn’t know that I know her twitter) that she posted a screenshot of our conversation and captioned: how can someone ignore me for over a day about some fucking pants. 

I decided to text her. She was mad that I ignored her for over a day and that she couldn’t smell that I was hurt about that. We got into a pretty rough fight about how we should act like ourselves and that she doesn’t think it will be good in our future if fights like these keep happening. She didn’t know if she wanted to go on with me, but after a lot of texts and telling her how the future can hold anything. Even if she’s with another boy it can still end up like shit, but no one knows so you have to take a risk. I told her that I’m willing to take it with her. Some texts later and she told me the same. 

Now where do I go from here? I still love her deeply and she loves me. There is still almost a year until we go official and meet eachothers parents. We are both loyal to eachother, but I don’t know if it will even last until next year, because she’s still not a 100% certain. Should I care less? Should I keep going after her? I need help.

TLDR: Dating a girl and got into a few fights over texts where she can’t be herself because I take everything too serious and she hurts me. Now in the problem of being ourselves while still making things work out between us. What to do?"

So I'm currently nearing the end of a long\-term relationship\-\-about 5 years. Over the last year, I've contemplated this breakup. It's been a really tough, confusing situation, but I've ultimately decided that it would be best for both of us. We've been very disconnected for the last year, barely even kissing. It's been more of a friendship than anything...

 He is in the process of moving out of my apartment, so it makes things very difficult to still be around each other a great deal of time. We've both talked about it many times, and I am positive he knows that it's coming... But I'm waiting to make it official until we don't have to sleep next to each other every single night.

To complicate things further, I've had a blooming crush for a couple months now. He's a colleague at school, and after having developed feelings, I found out I'd be taking an incredible internship\-\-the best job I'll have ever had\-\-where he is also an intern. I guess normally, that would be pretty exciting. In fact, not very long ago I thought I was getting signals from my crush that he liked me too. 

Make no mistake, I'd been considering this breakup long before I even knew my crush. I would never attempt to start anything with the crush until my breakup has been finalized. As far as I know, the crush has no idea \(or a vague idea from flirting\) that I like him.

Part of the reason I'm posting this is because I can't get this crush off my mind. I'm able to rationalize that he's not perfect, and that my judgment is being clouded probably by a lot of things. But I can't let go that he attracts me on an intellectual level, which is a major thing my last relationship has always been missing. I also collaborate with my crush creatively, and it's extremely fulfilling in a way I've never experienced before.

I have been 100&amp;#37; honest about the crush with my sort of current boyfriend. He's been pretty understanding, and the breakup seems somewhat mutual. I can tell he's sad, but I get the sense that he knows it's best too.

So I start my internship in about a week. I wish I could just stop thinking about it, or that I had more friends or something to keep my mind off it. I've become quite a recluse in my current relationship... I don't want to put either of our jobs in jeopardy, or begin a rebound relationship. But I also don't want to be distracted at work, thinking what if, just what if?

 I want to know what you guys think\-\-is this crush better left a secret and forgotten, or should I get my feelings out there and deal with whatever response he has? "

I began ditching class and dropping out of all of my extra curricular activities, and got some pretty average grades. One regret from this period was that I was attending sessions to push me into applying for Oxford/Cambridge university, and who knows - maybe I could have achieved that! But I was stoned as shit all the time, got some pretty average grades, and that opportunity was now far from possible. 

I've been a musician ever since I was a kid, in bands and making electronic music. Ever since I started I had the ambition to make an album. After almost 15 years of making music, I STILL have never achieved that. In fact, I literally have hundreds, perhaps thousands of unfinished pieces of music. I completed a song when I was 14 which is still my most polished track, and my most reached track on Soundcloud etc. Again, god knows where I could be musically if I hadn't started smoking weed. 

I actually got into a really great university to study an awesome experimental music course. I moved to a city that could possibly be the weed capital of England. Dealers with Cali-quality weed for £10 a gram were only ever a quick phone call away. Technically I excelled in my studies, and gained a First Class Honours. Sounds great right, but once again so many of my projects could have been far better. When I graduated, I had several e-mails from my supervisors that expressed their disappointment that, despite hitting the grades, I handed in lots of incomplete work, and I never took up the excellent opportunities handed to me on a plate, such as performing in concerts , getting internships and work experience. 

Fast forward to now, I'm studying a Masters by Research. SOUNDS GREAT RIGHT? At this point maybe I sound a little bit arrogant, this is not about my achievements. It is about the fact that I guess I became 'functional'. No, I haven't just sat on my couch the entire time, but instead put the bare minimum into huge opportunities to create this sort of illusion that I am having success. 

Illusion is such a key word here. I created illusions of success all over my life. Due to the nature of the work where i do not have to attend class or anything and only attend monthly meetings, I monthly prepared an facade of bullshit that created the illusion that I was handling my research very well, and they were really happy with this. I would spout bullshit to my friends and family about how I am researching this and that, and they always believed it. 

The real face of my life is this: spending days upon days in my music studio, not making any music. Smoking 1-2g of very good quality weed every day, wasting thousands of pounds of research funding on weed, Binge eating , binge sleeping, chronically masturbating, for a whole month until my monthly meeting arrived. Then I would have a few days of intense stress, where I prepared my next illusion that everything was going fine. 

But obviously this illusion could only last so long. The breaking point is that I had a research presentation and performance in front of an academic body of people. Obviously I left this to the last minute as well, and spend my final days of preparation in the most stoned, bingey state of my entire life. The night before my big day, I FREAKED THE FUCK OUT. I was sat in my studio shaking, smoking blunts, mind racing, terrified as my illusion was crumbling before my eyes. Maybe I could have continued the illusion, but it was too much, and I bailed. I e-mailed four important members of staff and told them I would not be attending due to mental health. I let a lot of people down that night, but most importantly let myself down, and I basically cried all night. 

------------------
ENTER THE SOBRIETY
------------------
I have tried to quit weed many many times, but as you guys all know its not so easy as that. The longest I ever went in 8 years of smoking was 14 days. That day I realised that this had to stop, and if I didn't I would end up that guy who had a shit loads of potential and oppportunities, and threw it all away. 

I opened up to my research supervisors, who were incredibly supportive. Sometimes you forget that these people are humans too, they have lived long lives and as musicians, have probably seen hundreds of peers and students lose their potential through weed. 

I am now 11 days sober, and I feel like this time it is different. I can't go back on what I've said to people, and I feel amazing. I have been giving a second chance on my research, and if I stay sober I believe that I will be able to achieve an amazing thing. I feel so clear headed and motivated, but incredibly guilty of my past illusions of functionality, the lies and the week long binges of hyper stimulus. 

One of the key things I have learned is that addiction is the opposite of connection. All this time I have been locking myself in my room, telling friends I am too busy researching to hang out, whilst I sit there jacking off stoned out of my mind and binge eating. Absolutely fucking pathetic - but I truly believe I have been given a second chance. 

Guys, don't waste your potential. I got lucky and found my pathway early on in life, but I feel like I got so close to completely fucking it up, to giving up. Truly feel blessed that i have received a second chance.

DONT WASTE YOUR POTENTIAL. NO PAIN NO GAIN. YOU WILL RECEIVE FROM LIFE WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT.

Peace, and stay strong guys. Sorry for the life story, I just had to get it off of my chest."

I'm 19 now, fairly accomplished for my age i'd like to believe? living by myself now \(thank god\) Studying conjoint science x business degree at university with a part time job as an intern for a huge multi\-national bank. The word ""narcissist"" hadn't even really entered my vocabulary until about last year when i described my frustrations to a friend and he suggested that my mother may very much be a narcissist. There are so many things i want to talk about but i think putting it in bullet points would make it easiest for both me and you;

• nothing is ever her fault/blaming it on other people; when my sister got depression, it was my fault for ""arguing with her too much"" even though we are closer than twins, i have been pretty much raising her since dad left, each other being the only ones there fore one another, and in my sisters words, ""you picked me up on the side of the road where mum left me"". when my sister told me she was suicidal, i had no choice but to tell our mother about it in order to ask for money for counselling. she replies ""suicidal? look what you've taught her"" to be fair, i had a self\-harming incident when i was a bit younger caused from the frustration with my family but my sister never found out.

• caring WAY too much what other people think: when i was 12, my uncle made me kiss him on the mouth on christmas day \(seemed perfectly normal to me\) but then when i did so, he grabbed and jammed his tongue down my throat and didn't let go. i'm not sure if that's molestation but it certainly made me extremely upset and i repressed this memory until i was abit older, about 16. at which time i told my mum about it. she told me she knew. i asked her why she didn't do anything about it? she said: ""what do you want me to do? bring our families to court? that would look bad on us publicly"" no, not because it was too expensive, or because of some bullshit about forgiving. because of image.

• contradicting herself so that the argument benefits her. just today, we went to have a family dinner with our grandparents. on the way home an argument sparked and essentially, she made three points in this one argument: firstly, ""you're way too blunt. you just can't bear to see me happy. you just have to open that loud mouth and point out something don't you? you just can't turn a blind eye""\- i was asking why her and her boyfriend are sleeping in different rooms? and then the conversation spiralled, i ended up saying ""i just wish you would see me like how everyone else sees me, like \[sister\], \[alex\] and my friends."" she then says; ""so you're saying i see you differently? that just means you're fake. i've always told you that you're fake."" and when i pointed our her contradiction, she says: ""well i wouldn't bring up something my mum wouldn't want to hear, you just have to be fake sometimes to keep everyone happy, you can't possible be honest ALL the time.""

came home, had a vent to my sister and she basically said i have two choices: to be fake and lie and sugarcoat the truth but be loved by my mother \(as done so by my brother and sister\) or be honest and despised for saying what she doesn't want to hear, but what she needs to hear.

i'm worried i've explained an unfair story because it came from my point of view but i guess this is my vent so be it.

the issue runs so much deeper with so many more dimensions than i have explained here but this is the best i can do for now. sorry about the long read and thank you for your time, i seriously appreciate it. i just hope i'm not alone in this."

8krujy,5,2018-05-20,[20 M] Serious Trust Issues with [20 F] Girlfriend. Am I paranoid or should I trust my gut?,2018Tau,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8krujy/20_m_serious_trust_issues_with_20_f_girlfriend_am/,"Hello all, I'm writing because I want to see what you guys think about my situation. It's kind of complicated, so bare with me. 

I met this girl through a mutual friend, and I've been very paranoid since the very beginning. We had a great beginning, with plenty of intimacy and affection. The first red flag came up in December, during a University recess. I was texting her as usual, and it was mid day. She tells me that she seen a child hood friend, we will call him Tim, post a picture of him and his new gf. She was devastated. She was crying and telling me she was so sad and upset. I thought it would be best to be supportive and loving. So that's what I did. She says it no longer bothers her. Apparently he's a loser and they've discussed how they will never have a future together. The weird thing is, she visits with his family regularly. She claims to not see him often but I have my doubts. When she's with his family she will hardly text me. 

Another thing which bothers me is that she won't post to Facebook about our relationship. I believe it's because she's very introverted. She doesn't want all of the attention of all her family and friends. I have already introduced her to my family, but I've repeatedly been hidden from hers. She's been living with me for 6 months, but they still don't know we're together.

The last few months have been difficult. When I look into her eyes I feel a lot of love and feelings of happiness, but when she's away it feels like I'm getting the cold shoulder. She's doing an internship at the moment, so we're spending 3 months apart. She doesn't seem too adamant about seeing me. She doesn't seem too keen on pleasing me in any way, unless she benefits as well. 

Not too sure what to do guys, please give me advice!

**TL;DR; : I'm worried about the way my gf is behaving. I want to be with her, but I'm worried about her level of commitment and honesty. **"

Me &amp; Tetra have our first date tonight too. ""Drev?"" Navy appears in my doorway,"" Hacka will see you now."" ""Thanks."" I stand up &amp; make my way to Hacka's office. I knock on the door before I enter. ""Drev, glad to see you. Have a seat."" Hacka smile. ""Ok..."" I sit down. I bite my lip nervously. I really hope She chose me for the job. ""So, Drev... It's been a pleasure having you work here for the past week. You've showed us your skills &amp; your weaknesses. So, I bet you want to know what I chose."" Hacka says. ""Yes!"" I practically yell. ""Drev, I'm very sorry... That you won't be going back to Florida!"" Hacka yells. ""REALLY!?"" I jump out of my chair,"" THANK YOU SO MUCH HACKA! I PROMISE I WON'T LET YOU DOWN!"" I hug him. I run out of the room screaming. ""I GOT THE JOB!"" I yell as I run around,"" I'm working at Sky Media!!!"" 

//Time Skip: THE DATE// I stand outside the movie theater waiting for Tetra. I'm about to take out my phone to call him when I see him approaching. ""Hey Drev! You look great!"" Tetra smiles. ""You too!"" I smile back. We're going to see ""Lights Out"" &amp; then we're going to eat dinner at Marmaduke’s. (A/N I saw ""Lights Out"" with my 2 friends &amp; it was so scary! I screamed so loud! But it was amazing, I recommend it to anyone who like Horror Movies!) 

We are in the middle of the movie now. ""Don't do it Jackal!"" Tetra whispers,"" Don't go in that room."" But, of course he does to it! ""AHHHHHHH!"" I scream as I bury my head into Tetra's shoulder. ""Is he still there?"" ""He's gone now."" Tetra laughs. ""Oh, good! Sorry..."" I smile. ""It's fine."" She says. Minutes later I feel his arm rap around my shoulders protectively. The movie gets out at 10:00 &amp; then we go to dinner. ""Ok! Ok! Give me one chance on The Claw &amp; I guarantee I'll win!"" Tetra bites into a fry. ""You're on Hot Shot!"" I smile. We walk over to The Claw Machine. ""Ok. Back, forward, right, forward, and... Drop!"" Tetra yells. I watch as the claw drops and lands on a stuffed bear. ""I WON!!!!!"" She cheers. ""Good job, you're going to need to teach me how to do that sometime!"" I smile. ""Sure!"" Tetra says. ""And, for you my lady!"" Tetra tosses the bear to me. ""Thank you my good sir!"" I laugh. Tetra is walking me back to Hacka's house. We stop outside. ""I had a great night."" I smile. ""Ya. It was fun."" Tetra says. ""Well, I'll see you soon!"" I turn towards the door. ""Drev?"" May asks. ""Hmm?"" I spin around. His lips crash into mine &amp; I can feel fireworks! ""WOAH! Just in time!"" I hear a voice from behind me. I pull away from Tetra &amp; spin around to see Hacka in the doorway. ""Hacka..."" I roll my eyes. ""Well, goodnight Tetra!"" ""Goodnight Drev! Hacka!"" Tetra turns away. I push through Hacka to get to the door. ""Hey homewrecker!"" I smile. ""Who told you to spy on me?"" ""Your dad as a matter of fact!"" Hacka says. I turn around to face him,"" You talked to my dad?"" I scowl. ""Yup! And for now I am your honorary big brother!"" Hacka smiles. ""Oh, gosh!"" ""So, make sure there is no funny business or I might just have to kill Tetra!"" ""Sure thing!"" I walk upstairs. ""Hi Drev!"" D_rev smiles. ""Oh, hi D_rev!"" I smile back as I walk over to her,"" And hello baby Spirals!"" Spirals smiles as I pick him up. ""How did the date go?"" D_rev asks as he continues to fold clothes. 

I sit down,"" It was good! Well, until Mr. Homewrecker downstairs ruined it! Supposedly She's my 'big brother' now!"" ""She's always been like that. Looking out for people is what She lives for!"" D_rev sighs. I bounce Spirals on my lap. She looks up at me &amp; smiles. I sigh,"" I want this someday... A nice husband &amp; a child. At least that's my dream anyways!"" ""You know what Drev?"" D_rev sets down the shirt he's folding. ""What?"" I ask. ""I just have a feeling that you &amp; Tetra were meant to be... Perfect together."" D_rev smiles. I smile. Maybe D_rev's right... Maybe one day I will end up marrying Tetra. There's always a possibility at least...

8ktb6l,6,2018-05-20,My father wants me to quit my internship.,purplejumpinglobster,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8ktb6l/my_father_wants_me_to_quit_my_internship/,"Hey guys, I’ve just found this sub and I thought I would share my experiences and ask for some advice. 

So I’m turning 23 in a month, and have just graduated from university. I’m living with an extremely controlling father, who puts a 9pm curfew on me and starts shouting at me whenever I’m home late (even though it’s because I had classes or was at work). He also doesn’t allow me to leave the house on weekends. 

He also has an issue with my career choices. I want to go into marketing and have secured an internship at a start-up, which I’ve been working at since February, to get more experiences in the field. So when I told him about it, he freaked out and insisted I quit cause it’s not the field in which my degree is in, and insisted I quit my internship and start looking for one that is relevant to my degree. 

The problem is that while I find my course content interesting, it’s not something I’d want to spend my life doing and I actually found that I enjoy marketing more, which is why I’ve actually done multiple internships to get more experience. I really want to stand up to my father and assert my choices, but I’m not sure how. Talking to him is like talking to a wall, and whatever points I bring up, no matter how rational, are ignored and he just continues screaming his points at me. I’m also worried that if I stand my ground, i would get hurt as he does have a history of being abusive. 

The only option I have is moving out of the house, but my mother thinks I’m being overly emotional and that I should “learn to accept things”, rather than moving out. (I’m from a country where it’s not normal for people to move out of home till they’re married, cause the cost of a house/renting here is insane, but I can probably move in with my bf) 

I would love it if anyone can give me their opinions and any advice they have on dealing with parents like mine? I’m really new to the sub and reddit in general, so I’m sorry if I’ve broken any rules on here! Just let me know and I’ll edit it. 😅"
8ktedf,7,2018-05-20,Join a small company or big company as a fresh graduate? I am a ChemE,sawyeratjx,malaysia,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/8ktedf/join_a_small_company_or_big_company_as_a_fresh/,"Hi all, Chemical Engineering student graduating in around 6 months here. I am very active and outgoing in professional events and co-curricular activities and heavily involved in my university engineering student chapters and gain a lot of connections in the industry and now because of it, I have plenty of job offers waiting for me 

My ideal position is sales &amp; application engineer as I am easy going and I love meeting new people while ensuring I can develop my engineering professionalism in the future. However, I am not sure which company should I join...

Company A (connection - Director/owner): &lt;20 employees, basic salary RM3,300 + RM600 for car installment and heaps of allowance claims like petrol, tolls, and entertainment.

Company B (connection - Senior sales&amp;app manager): &lt;200 employees, basic salary RM3,000 with kinda normal welfare

Company C (connection - manager): &gt;10,000 employees, international corporate with basic salary RM2,700 with normal allowances up to RM4K

I have talked to them and most of them told me just shoot them an email if I am interested to join their company and they will do the rest. However, the owner of company A actually called me to ask me to go for his company for a second interview, I have definitely aced the first interview with a manager of the company and quite certain he looks highly upon me. Truth be told, I am very attracted by the offer of company A for a fresh grad and I believe I can increase the demand of my salary because the owner has seen my display my leadership and responsibilities in many occasions. The owner of this company has tremendous connections and he is a strong influence where he recommended me to a world-renowned institute for my internship program overseas a few months ago and he owns 3 companies, I look upon him very highly for his success.

So now here is the issue... I am a person who wishes to have my very own company before I'm 30 (I'm now 22) and many of the successful people I know actually told me while in big companies, I may not be involved in every stage of work but I will get loads of exposure from the big company system itself, and that will help me in the future when I decide to open up my very own company. Whereas in a small company where people claim the employee will learn a lot, but most of the time doing miscellaneous work? 

What's your opinion redditors, based on your experience working in small/big companies?

A small, medium or a big company will be more suited for my career growth to achieve my goal?

I am a CS new grad \(finished my courses in April\), and just started working full\-time as a developer in Vancouver. The pay isn't great compared to a lot of my peers \(I make about 30/hr, which is probably at the bottom 20&amp;#37; of my peers\), but it was my first job, and I was happy with it \(I didn't do coop or internship during my university\). I had a difficult time trying to get a job, took me about two months. :/

My questions sort of is, I now have quite a bit of free time to do what I want, I really want to invest that time to advance my career in the next 5 years as much as possible. My personal background is similar to a lot of you guys, from 110 to 310. The only language I learned outside of school was a bit of Python.

I want to make my questions a bit more clear, so I list them out down below:

1. What would you recommend me to do/learn so I can become a competitive intermediate/senior dev in 5 years? 
2. Should I try to learn a few more new languages during my free time? In particular, I am thinking of C#/.NET, as I know nothing about it. I am also thinking of learning a more recent language, such as Julia/Go, would that be helpful?
3. Pretty much everybody is talking about machine learning/AI stuff these days, but I just feel like my background isn't really allowing me to do those stuff \- My grades were kinda bad, which was why I didn't want to do school anymore. Should I still try to ""embrace"" ML/AI stuff and learn them a bit? I took 322, but didn't find them to be super useful.

Thanks in advance for all the advice"
8ktvvh,0,2018-05-20,"I [20 M] have had a girlfriend [20 F] for about a year and 2 months. However, I met my highschool crush [29 F] a few days ago and have been feeling like an emotional wreck.",martian_14,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ktvvh/i_20_m_have_had_a_girlfriend_20_f_for_about_a/,"As the title says, I have been with my girlfriend for about 14 months. I really love this girl and we have always had a good time together. But we kind of got together just because we were both single and lonely.
We met in highschool but didn't really keep in touch, a few messages here and there but that's pretty much it, not much feeling back then. One day in my freshman year in college she texted me out of the blue. It started out funny but we ended up dating each other.
Although we didn't know each other really well, we turned out to be a good match and share a similar sense of humor.

But back in highschool(about 4 years ago), there was this instructor at our club, Nicole. I loved her. I got to know her pretty well but I never really showed my feelings since she had a boyfriend back then, and she was just gonna be our instructor for 1 year. I didn't think much after she left because I had known it would be a hopeless crush since it started, but I really missed her. Fast forward to my senior year in highschool, there's a new intern teacher in our school, guess who? It was Nicole. I remember running through the hall after I saw her from a distance just to say hi. She was studying in a college in the same city. The crush went on for another year, I tried a few little moves but never had the confidence to tell her how I feel knowing I was just another student to her. A year later I graduated and her internship ended. She went to work in another city, we reply to each other on social media from time to time, but not much else. I went to the same college as she did, which leads us to a few days ago.

Nicole had already returned to the college a couple times before and we have had plans to meet, but we couldn't due to clashing schedules. Last Thursday, Nicole went back to visit her professor and we planned to meet up at a coffee shop.  We talked a lot that afternoon. I was really happy to have finally talked to her in such a long time. But I was so happy that I feel like I'm cheating on my girlfriend. I knew I still loved Nicole. As much as I hate to admit, I almost lied when Nicole asked me if I have a girlfriend(she's not flirting in any way), and I felt like I'm cheating on her when I told her I do like WTF. Before we left the place she gave me a hug, for a moment I thought I was gonna cry when I touched her. I've never felt so much sorrow, regret, and anger all at once as I did in that split second. I was so mad at my self yet so confused. I walked her to the bus stop, and I stood there for so long after the bus drove off that I missed my class in the evening.

To make things worse, I went on a date with my girlfriend 2 days later and everything felt so strange and painful. She knew about Nicole and our meeting and thought it would be fine. I promised her beforehand that I had no feeling for Nicole anymore, at least that was what I thought.

I'm such a mess right now and it's driving me crazy. Last night I browsed through Nicole's Instagram page and realized that I remember every damn post. I cried myself to sleep. I didn't even know that I have always cared about her. I rarely use social media and I don't really read any post unless it's from my girlfriend. And of course, Nicole, I guess. I really love my girlfriend and I don't ever want to break her heart. But I feel like this is not how I should be in a relationship. It's not that I have a chance with Nicole or anything, I feel like I'd rather be single right now. I probably won't try to get Nicole anyway, I don't think she has any feeling for me. I know I should just let go, but I just can't.

I keep asking myself what if Nicole is my true love? But is that just an excuse I give myself to be disloyal? Am I even being disloyal? Am I just trying to chase the shadow of what used to be my highschool crush? Should I just let go? I'm sorry that I don't have a specific question to ask here, but I really need some advice right now, thank you.

TL;DR: Have a girlfriend, but found out that I still love my highschool crush and it's driving me insane.

P.S. Sorry that this post may be a little overwhelming, English is my second language and I tried my best telling my story."

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

8kuclh,24,2018-05-20,[Article/Post] Current approach to mobility I use,MATTtheSEAHAWK,bodyweightfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8kuclh/articlepost_current_approach_to_mobility_i_use/,"So I originally wrote this here: http://mattgray.net/fitness/2018/05/20/an-approach-to-mobility.html

If you have any questions feel free to ask here or on my website, this approach to mobility has worked very well for me recently (I've been doing this or slight variations of it for about 6 - 8 months now). I have stretched and worked on mobility for about 3 years, but these past months of progress have been the best I have seen. I'm also a big inflexible boi, so I certainly started from a pretty minimal base.

# Context

I started from a trashcan level of mobility and have reached full front splits, full pancake, a deep german hang, and calves to the ground in middle splits over a period of about 3 years. While I'm far from an expert, I've learned a decent bit over the past few years and the goal of this post is to summarize what I have learned, describe my current approach from an abstract perspective, and then also talk about how I am applying it. If you have any questions or criticisms, feel free to comment them below. I'm still learning and it's entirely possible to get something wrong. On a similar note, if you know something doesn't work for you, or it feels like it hurts, don't do it blindly. Either consult a medical professional or find something else. You only have one body, don't screw it up.

This approach isn't any one concept. I've learned a lot from [Jordan Garcia](https://www.instagram.com/jordangarcia1775/), [Emmet Louis](https://www.youtube.com/user/EmmetLouis), [Antranik](https://www.youtube.com/user/AntranikDotOrg), and [Tom Merrick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0DZhN-8KFLYO6beSaYljg) among others. It'd be hard to credit every source because I've picked up so much here and there. If you see something here that sounds like it's from somewhere not mentioned, feel free to link it below as well so that I and others can see it and learn from it.

# Abstract Concepts

I don't have an elegant way to put this, so I'm basically going to bullet the points that guide my mobility training these days. I'm not following this currently everyday because I've gotten very busy with an internship, but when I have it has worked fantastically, decent results came quickly, and most of all it wasn't a miserable or terribly time-consuming approach to mobility training.

* **Spend a little time doing mobility every day** - whether this is [CARs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGUhVelktk4), light stretching, or whatever it may be, take your joints through their ranges everyday if you can. It doesn't have to take long, but doing this has gone a long ways towards maintaining mobility when I don't get the chance to heaviliy pursue it or push it often.
* **Work mobility like strength training** - between 1 and 3 days a week, depending on how often you feel like it, work your mobility progressively to try and improve it. I have seen great results with even just 1 intense day a week and the aforementioned daily light movement/mobility. 2-4 sets per movement has worked well.
* **Unlike strength training, go from isolation to compounds** - start with individual muscles/joints, mobilize them before going on to a larger stretch that contains it. For example, stretch your hamstrings, calves, and hip flexors before working on front splits. This will help deal with limiting factors in each position.
* **Strengthen your end ranges** - when you work with a stretch and it's a main one that you would like to improve, peform contractions in end ranges. I like 20-30s per contraction, specifically beginning with pushing against the stretch and then pulling myself deeper. Perform all sorts of contractions you can think of. Use your muscles to push against the stretch, use your muscles to try and pull yourself deeper in the stretch, actively hold the stretch with no outside assistance. Do isometrics and active mobility work in every way you can imagine in that position. **By building strength there, you're basically telling your body you can go into this position you may have not had access to before. **

**Take-aways:** Do some light work everyday. Once or twice a week do 2-3 of auxillary/warm-up stretches for the positions you'd like to achieve followed by 2-3 sets of intense and focused end-range strengthening work on the main positions you would like to achieve. Spending 20 or so seconds on each stretch (auxillary and main) *pushing against the stretch*, 20 seconds *pulling deeper into the stretch with your own musculature*, then spend 20 seconds at the end *trying to completely get into the position with your own strength using minimal assitance*.

So the main contractions you can do (for 20-30s each) per stretch are:

1. pushing against the stretch
2. pulling deeper into the stretch with your own musculature (still using outside assistance such as letting gravity pull you into a split while trying to open)
3. trying to completely get into the position with your own strength using minimal assitance (this would be trying to lift your leg up after doing a hamstring stretch for example)

# Applying

I'll only cover front splits in detail, but the same can be applied for pretty much all stretches. I'll list some auxillary stretches I like for other positions apart from front splits to cover a bit more, but applying the concepts yourself will help you learn more about how it works instead of just putting a lot out there that can be applied without thought.

## Front Splits

* Do a general warm-up to get the blood flowing so you're not cold. I also like to do some really basic hamstring and hip flexor stretches to feel out the position before spending quality time in it.
* Do 2-3 sets of paired hamstring, calf, and hip flexor work, separating your splits work per side. So for your right leg forward, it may look like this:
* Do 1 minute of end range contractions with the right leg hamstring and calf (the order of stretches mentioned above would be 20s driving your heel down, 20s trying to pull your torso down with your hip flexors, and 20s lifting your leg off the ground), slowly working deeper. You can move between flexed and pointed feet.
* Do 1 minute of end range contractions with the left leg hip flexor (squared hips!) (20s pushing your back leg/foot into the ground, 20s trying to actively open your hips more, then 20s lifting your leg up behind you into the air potentially from hands and knees on the ground).
* Do 2-3 sets of front splits.
* Per split, after the auxillary stretches, slowly work into the splits and spend about 20-30s pushing against the stretch, then let yourself slide deeper by actively trying to open the splits for 20-30s. After this, more time can be spent in the splits just relaxing, but this seems to do the trick for me and some others I have worked with when using 2-3 sets.

## Middle Splits

Auxillary Stretches:

* [Tailor pose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha3BgV5K1eQ) - 20s pushing knees down with hands and pushing against your hands by trying to lift your knees, 20s trying to pull your knees closer to the ground, and then 20s with hands off trying to hold them down.
* [Horse stance series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXWtk3NLESk) - I don't follow the above protocol with this, but I do like this series by Antranik. I use the frog pose occasionally with the above contraction protocol, but spending time in the position before middle splits is the main important thing.

## Shoulder Flexibility

* [Butchers block for shoulder flexion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhhaK3nDbbA) - I follow the above protocol pushing my elbows down into the block, trying to lift my elbows up while still on the block, then scooting forward as close as needed to lift up the elbows. just enough actively.
* [Floor shoulder extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_HFGPLpnmc) - 20s pushing against the floor, 20s trying to lift hands, then 20s scooting back enough to lift the hands (can be done with a bar to keep the hands close and not letting them drift). Be mindful of how the shoulders and elbows feel here.

# Conclusion

The main purpose of this post was to get the abstract approach I use out there, along with a big and some smaller examples so that it makes sense. A lot of people don't like training for flexibility because with standard approaches (60s statics all day everyday) it can get boring. I hope this approach makes flexibility a bit more quantifiable and can give at least some people some better results.

I recently found my first girlfriend at 22 (she is 20), and things were unbelievably great for the first 3 months of talking. We saw each other just about every day, and for a few week period, she slept over every night at my apartment (we both agreed it was probably too much, but we both enjoyed it so didnt really stop). Then summer hit and we both moved back to our parents houses (about an hour away from eachother). She has been super busy and we havent gotten to hangout much the last 3 weeks. At first the separation was fine, but then I got obsessively concerned with her, asking her daily if she was ""okay"". She informed me yesterday (when I again asked if she was okay) that this has annoyed her, and I told her I'd stop. But the only reason I ask so often is because she's very emotional and once told me she faces depression, and I want her to open up with me about it but she never does. This distance sucks because I dont know what to do to cheer her up, and it feels like my efforts have been annoying her. I'm really torn because I dont want to annoy her, but about a week ago she also told me that we didnt talk enough. I just need to outside perspectives please. I love her, and I don't want to fuck things up but everything I do feels wrong.

Also in about 2 weeks im moving closer to her for an internship, and I'm hoping that may bring some relief to the situation, but honestly who knows. 

This is just one of those things that I've been thinking about obsessively over the last week.

- *Currently I have a Logan x Pepper RP involving time travel, a Tony x Pepper RP prior to The Avengers which may be on hiatus, and a Raven x Erik (may become Raven x Logan in time) RP. I love the RPs I have going but I would love one or two more stories because I am on such a MCU kick.*

- *I tend to reply two to four times a week, depending on how I feel and how much time I have. Other duties include taking care of my parents, chores, work and an online course in teaching abroad. So posts will not be immediate. I have other priorities but that does not mean I don't take writing or the partnership of writing seriously. The more we communicate our goals and interests for the future of the story, the more likely it stay alive and we both remain interested even if the pace is slow.*

- *I prefer Reddit PMs but I can go with Discord or Google Docs as well.*

- *I play females and males so while I am seeking a male partner, I am capable of doubling or tripling up on additional roles.*

- *Generally I can give anywhere from three to eight paragraphs. Three is the minimum I give and take but I like writing more. And I have no issue waiting days or even weeks if the post is more thoughtful and epic, than one thrown together in haste.*

- *Finally, mature themes are probably going to arise but I don't make a big deal about them. I'd prefer to have someone who is old enough to handle darker topics but who doesn't want to push them onto me constantly.*

- *Below I have outlined characters I am capable of playing. They are listed in order of both experience and interest. I will outline my vision for the character and then the male characters I would want someone else against them and how I see those dynamics playing out. I am open to other suggestions. We can plot together and see what we both want to try.*

- *And this is all pertaining to the movies and tv shows, sadly I cannot compensate much for not being aware of the comics or outside information. To me it's too much to really dig into so I would like us to stick to the movies and shows if possible. Thank you.*

**Characters I can play:**

- - -

**Pepper Potts:** *I see her as being outspoken and bold. She has worked for one of the most difficult people in the world. She came from a small town with loving parents who secretly wish Pepper worked elsewhere but they cannot deny how their daughter's hard work paid off. Pepper makes sure her parents don't have to work another day in their lives. She gets things done and she is wildly independant. Her social life is nonexistent as she's poured her life into bettering both Stark Industries and Tony Stark himself. Dating has been pretty much cast aside as she works on her career. She believes Stark Industries can be a global force for good. She has even taken steps to learn self-defense and firearms from Natasha. Pepper Potts is a woman who is always in control, knows what she wants and doesn't let anything stop her from achieving her goals.*

**Suitable Matches:**

- **Tony Stark:** *He was her boss for many years. They know each other rather well. Pepper has always held a soft spot for him, despite the many headaches he has caused her. He has taken steps to better himself, not wanting to die without having done more for the world than make money off of its old wars. Tony is protective and very smart, hopefully smart enough to see the amazing woman who has remained by his side for so long.*

- **Logan:** *A man who keeps people at arms length. He has been through a lot, he has lived through a lot. He could either fall back in time or Pepper could fall forward in time. Old or young is welcomed. Logan pretends that he's cold, hoping to not just protect himself but those he's hurt in the past. Pepper has dealt with difficult men before, she knows their walls will crumble eventually.*

- **Matt Murdock:** *Needing a lawyer is pretty vital when you run a company and Mr. Murdock had proven his heart is in the right place. He is brought to Stark Industries to help with the public image and ensure the Stark name isn't dragged through the mud. Matt's other identity is something Pepper perhaps stumbles upon and she takes it upon herself to accompany him in his pursuit of The Hand.*

- **Steve Rogers:** *By all accounts, Steve is a good guy looking to acclimate to his new life. And Pepper is hoping for a break from work, the stress prompting a needed vacation o her own. They come together in a small town, hoping to save a few people and remember who they are, not just what they have done. They have different strengths but can find comfort in one another, aware their past doesn't define them.*

- **Charles Xavier:** *He is a man who has many gifts. He and Pepper converge when mutants come forward to help in defending New York from an alien invasion. Charles decides to offer his services to Tony and Pepper, believing it vital for everyone with gifts to work together. While Tony is busy tinkering, Pepper and Charles grow closer as Charles begins to reopen his school and Pepper assists him, using grants from Stark Industries. Young Charles preferred here but I'm not picky.*

**Jessica Jones:** *I see her as young and snarky, able to cut down the biggest man with a snide comment. She loves her best friend and sister dearly, would do anything for Trish. Jessica is tying to give up drinking, trying to take on more cases, likely following the events of season two (or one) of JJ. She is slowly learning to open up to people. She is still damaged after being kidnapped and raped by Kilgrave, having been reduced to a pretty puppet under his control. Now she tries to reclaim her life and her freedom.*

**Suitable Matches:**

- **Logan:** *The two meet in a dive bar, both deciding to break up a fight. Both then decide to team up to take down a pharmaceutical company called Transigen. They uncover the truth about mutants being genetically modified and free the children inside, including a girl named Laura.*

- **Tony Stark:** *He and Jessica meet at AA. Both of them promised their respective best friends they'd try to do better. But upon meeting one another, they start to slip. They continue to bond over bottles of scotch and vodka. When caught they decide to stop dragging the other down and finally shape up and be better people.*

- **Peter Quill:** *When finally able to return to Earth, there is a lot of adjusting that has to happen for Starlord. He just so happens to rent an apartment in Jessica's complex and the two begin to form a strange friendship as she helps him adjust to the shitty life on Earth.*

**Trish Walker:** *She is passionate about her work, wanting to make the world a better place. She has done a lot of stupid things and she is hoping to move beyond her past as a child star. She was abused and manipulated. She then went on to try her hand at singing which didn't go that well and planted a wedge between her and Jessica. Now that they're reconnecting, Trish wants to move forward. Jessica has her business and Trish wants to get into more serious investigation pieces. Trish decides to be a different kind of hero, beginning to explore the catlike skills she's starting to develop.*

- **Kilgrave:** *Kilgrave is not dead. He has been resurrected and is considering a change in his path. He sees now that Jessica will never be his again. Not truly. He decides to seek out the one person who has been somewhat sympathetic to him (at least when he had been held captive and assaulted by Jessica), aka Trish Walker. He decides to make her his mentor in order to better himself. Will he bring out her darker side or will she bring out some good in him?*

- **Logan:** *After a long night of drinking and mild property destruction, Trish bails out Jessica along with someone else who was with her, a man named Logan. Trish and Logan get to know each other over coffee as a way him somewhat paying Trish back for her help. The two continue to see each other and when Will returns, Logan is there to help put him in his place.*

- **Steve Rogers:** *As she's following a tip for one of her radio programs, she crosses paths with Captain America. She ends up convincing him to let her interview him and they hit it off. When Trish begins to exhibit signs of having powers, Steve decides to take her under his wing.*

**Raven Darkholme:** *Depending on where she is in the timeline, I see her as a fearless warrior but not keen on leaving her human side behind either. She struggles to embrace both her mutant side as well as her human side. She wants to embrace who she is but believes the world will only use or mock or fear her. Raven is skilled in combat and enjoys used her shapeshiting to get what she wants. She has no qualms about lying to people if it means she and those she's close to, get what they need. Raven can be sweet just as she can be ruthless. Deep down she wants to live a quiet life.*

**Suitable Matches:**

- **Erik Lehnsherr:** *His views on the world may be skewed but he is the one person who sees Raven as she is and not who she could be thanks to her gift. Erik relies upon her companionship and together they take on the world. I'd prefer something between FC and DoFP or something during Logan's timeline.*

- **Logan:** *Set during the Logan timeline, Raven disguises herself as a nurse and helps Laura escape and unite with her father, Logan. Together she, Logan, Laura and Charles embark on a quest to save the mutant children. Along the way, Raven makes it her mission to destroy Transigen and its various labs throughout the country. She and Logan eventually run into cloned mutants of their fallen comrades.*

- **Steve Rogers:** *Steve believes there's no to Raven then meets the eye. He also doubts that she has truly turned her back on the world. But to Raven, the world has turned its back on her. Steve tries to help Raven seen that the country still needs people like her and him and that she is beautiful in her truest form. At the same time, Raven brings a bit of a wild side out of Captain America.*

**Karen Page:** *Karen is sick of staying on the sidelines. She decides to step up her investigations into the various crime syndicates of New York City. She begins to prowl around Hell's Kitchen and ends up following a few leads. In her past, to get through college she had to take part in a certain film industry. But she is trying to put those mistakes behind her and make a name for herself, hoping to carry on Ben Urich's legacy.*

**Suitable Matches:**

- **Matt Murdock:** *As Matt continues to be the Daredevil protecting Hell's Kitchen, Karen insists she helps him fight crime. Matt teaches Karen some self-defense and together they fight crime.*

- **Peter Parker:** *While Karen is lurking around the streets of Hell's Kitchen, Peter ends up saving her from some thugs. She decides to get to know him better they bond over their need to make the world a better place. Peter is attending college now and Karen offers him an internship at her newspaper gig. Together, they work to clean up Hell's Kitchen.*

- **Charles Xavier:** *Karen is tasked to investigate some unusual activity in upstate New York, she uncovers a school for mutants and decides to help keep their school a secret. Eventually Charles decides it's time to start promoting for more students in need of guidance. Karen takes on a professor position in hopes of helping some of the wayward mutants turn down a more positive path in their lives.*"
8kvgsl,0,2018-05-20,M4F From bright-eyed intern to your boss's personal cocksleeve,dppsmurfboi,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8kvgsl/m4f_from_brighteyed_intern_to_your_bosss_personal/,"It was your first day in your new internship and you were feeling great!  You had just graduated from college at the top of your game, showing up all the naysayers who thought you couldn't make it in the business world.  It was pretty disgusting actually; most of the people telling you to give up were guys in your own class or old teachers telling you a woman had no place there.  It was 2018 for god's sake!  You didn't think anyone thought that way anymore, but you had to suffer through it nonetheless.

And here you finally were, on the bottom rung of the ladder for your dream company.  Of course, it was an unpaid position, a glorified barista to the guys working here, but you were going to learn all you could.  You compose yourself quickly before taking your latest coffee creation into Mr. Duncan's room; he is the regional manager for the company, so you figure impressing him will be the first step to your ascension.

As you enter, you see another female employee...Sarah you think...exiting the man's office.  She looks like she's been having a rough day, with messy hair, smeared makeup, almost as if she's been crying.  You say hi, but she just waves without saying anything, wiping her lips a bit.  Her cheeks are almost bulging as if she's got something in her mouth, but she just keeps walking, gulping whatever it is down as she passes you up.  Sarah has been here for a year trying to work her way up as well, but she's still just an intern in the company.  You wonder what could've gotten her so upset.

""Ah, the new intern, come on in,"" Mr. Duncan says.  He's sitting down at the desk, barely looking up from his computer as he tells you to join him.  ""Wow, already taking the initiative, I'm impressed!"" He smiles at you as he takes the cup of coffee and sets it back down, looking up at you face to face now.  ""So what's on your mind?  You look like you want to share something.""

You can't stop the flow of words, ""Well sir, I've just graduated so I have a pretty good idea of how this all works, but I was wondering if you could show me a bit if you're not incredibly busy or anything it would be much appreciated.""  All of it came out as one long sentence, almost one word, and you wince a bit.  That wasn't exactly how you'd rehearsed this...

As you're about to say anything, Mr. Duncan gives you a smile, and for some reason it makes you a bit uneasy, as if he doesn't believe you have any idea what you're doing here.  Before you can say anything else, he puts his hand up.  ""Listen, you might think you have an idea of how this works, but you don't.  As a small fry, there's only one thing for you to do, and that's to go on any errand and task that someone like me tells you to.""  

He pauses for a second to look you up and down.  ""So, here's your first task; take off those panties and give them to me.""

You think he's joking for a second, but he seems incredibly serious, holding his hand out as if expecting you to hand it to him right there.  And suddenly it all makes sense, Sarah just leaving the room now, how there were no other women in a position of power here.  But for some reason, you can't bring yourself to leave; you just stand there like a deer caught in headlights as he waits for you to take the first step in being the new office whore.

-

Hey everyone!  This is a pretty generic prompt once again, but I wanna do some good old fashioned workplace harassment.  I'm fine with changing the characters to whatever you want, or you can look through some of my old prompts as well to have an idea of what I'm into (it's all quite similar).  Looking forward to having a nice chat with you!"
8kw3ul,4,2018-05-20,Advice for moving out and going NC?,icariansav,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8kw3ul/advice_for_moving_out_and_going_nc/,"Hi! This is my first time posting here, so I will generally try to be a clear and concise as possible.

Growing up, I \[21F\] wasn't even aware that my Nmother's behavior was wrong\- I just assume it was how everyone's parents were. It wasn't until I started dating my very lovely and amazing girlfriend \[23F\], and she witnessed one of my nmother's tirades about me getting dinner on the table later than she wanted and failing to help her speedily put up the dishes while she was ranting at me. Upon being around her and her amazing and supportive family, I've slowly started sorting through how terrible my mother's been. For the sake of being concise, I'll be calling her ""The Keeper"" for the rest of this.

I'm a college student and had to return back to The Keeper because of some health issues that arose during my spring semester. Originally, I was going to be spending at least a month with my GF until I had to go back due to some bs internship The Keeper lined up for me. The thing is, she told me I could return to visit in NC if I spent my own money on the flight back. However, every time I ask her if the date would be okay for her, the Keeper goes on a rant about how she ""flew me home for a reason,"" even though she constantly keeps insinuating that she thinks I'm just making up the pain I'm in. Ultimately, my GF and I were just hoping to give me a break from her constant guilt\-tripping and gaslighting.

Today was the last straw for both me and my GF in dealing with her behavior. After I asked if I could simply travel up to visit to attend my GF's sister's graduation for a week, the Keeper went berserk. She yelled at me for wanting to leave while we didn't have any answers, then insisted on getting an appointment with a psychologist for me bc ""everything is in \[my\] head."" Initially, I assumed it was just one of her too\-intoxicated rants that she goes through about every night. But upon asking her about it this morning, she replied that she was serious since my live is ""filled with drama"" and that I'm always ""too dramatic"" and that *she* was never this dramatic or had so much drama in her life at age 21.

My GF has offered to drive the 10 hours between us to help me get out, but the issue still is this: I don't know how to make the move to do it. I really want to make the cut and go out on my own, but the guilt is consuming me for even thinking about leaving the Keeper and my brother behind. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you in advanced!"

I was accepted into Electrical Engineering at CU. I recently got an email saying I was ""secured"" a co-op placement for summer 2019. Obviously this is just trying to get me to confirm my offer to CU lol. I was wondering if it would be worth emailing them to see if it was possible to do the internship over this summer?

8kwqp6,171,2018-05-20,"Please, Let's Take Stock",WhosThatInMyBum,SkyrimTogether,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimTogether/comments/8kwqp6/please_lets_take_stock/,"The following was going to be a comment to another comment, but it was so general that I figured it should be its own post. I don't normally post, but I've been feeling pretty strongly about this after seeing the same kinds of comments on this sub lately.

There are some people here that I believe need to take a step back and examine what their expectations are and what they believe is owed to them. The atmosphere in this sub has turned a great deal from a few months ago and we should be asking whether or not this shift in attitude is justified.

There have been some opinions here along lines of ""the ST devs are scamming their Patrons"". What this sounds like is the ST devs are being accused of intentionally misinforming Patrons that they will be receiving ST if they pay up. What I gather from this opinion is that whoever subscribes to this idea is not aware of what a scam is or is has misunderstood the devs acceptance of support as an exchange of some kind.

There have been many occasions where proof was given that there is an actual working ""product"". Everyone who has seen the videos knows ST works and is playable. An incredible amount of work was done to create what we've seen of ST so far and the devs even made a literal checklist so people could follow along as tasks were completed.

As much as it will pain some to hear it, supporting ST through Patreon does not entitle you to ST. Support does not make the ST devs beholden to you. This is exactly the attitude that turned Kickstarter into a cesspool thanks to backer reward tiers, except on Kickstarter those tiers promised you an actual product. It is made very clear on Patreon what a backer receives for their donation. There are explicit statements regarding **where** Patreon money goes and nowhere does it say ""development will accelerate with more donations"" or ""we guarantee at least one update a week no matter what stage of development we are at with more donations"".

Patrons are not being misled or scammed, they are receiving exactly what they are patronizing for. The sourness is exactly antithetical to the spirit of Patreon: supporting something you believe in. It's beginning to sound like some people have bought something from Amazon and are getting impatient that the green delivery bar hasn't been moving like it was before. Putting money towards the ST Patreon should not have been some kind of agreement where you pay the ST devs and the devs give you ST. Putting money toward the ST Patreon should have been your willing support for devs that are creating something you would like to exist. There should have been no expectation besides what was listed in the reward tier you subscribed to, and if there were then **you shouldn't have patronized them in the first place**.

By all means, withdraw your Patreon support if you don't want to pay anymore. Just think about whether you were patronizing them for the right reasons.

This doesn't even address are those that demand the release of ST without financially supporting ST \(471 patrons vs 19.1k r/ST subs\).If you take anything away from this, at least take **this**: Be a little kinder, a little more patient, and a little less quick to react. ST is nothing like anything that has been created before. Many early comments were something along the lines of ""what I've been dreaming of"". Your life will be no worse if ST takes a little longer. The ST devs have given fans the hope of something like ST actually working. If those early comments are to be believed, then that alone should have you walking away from this project with more than you came in with.

**Edit**: A [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimTogether/comments/8kwqp6/please_lets_take_stock/dzcbu6b) by u/maxgriot regarding what they've been up to and why updates have slowed:

&gt;We have tried to be more open by opening a #git channel that contains litteraly every little thing we do.  
&gt;  
&gt;We have said that we would be rather innactive until the end of june due to work for some, school for others. The main streamers being Evayr and Dosh are both busy, Evayr is doing his internship atm and Dosh is dealing with finals.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also most of the work we currently do doesn't require us to even start Skyrim, I don't think you guys would be interested in how we setup our logging and metrics in Prometheus or ELK, it's very boring and tedious even for us, so you would die of boredom watching it.

Since this post has gotten so much attention and this comment attempts to explain what many have become upset about, I thought it would be better for everyone to include it here. However, I don't think this should absolve those who have demanded accountability from the devs for something that ultimately they have no tangible stake in besides their unrealized enjoyment of ST."

Currently I have an offer for both general engineering and ECEi, while for UOttawa I plan to partake in their comp eng coop program. I feel really conflicted with this decision as both school's have their pros and cons. 
I just want to clarify a few things and have you guys can add your two cents on the ECE program at Queen's. 
1. I heard rumors that the ECE program is run poorly or has bad profs, I'm wondering if this is true. 
2. For the internship program, how easy is it to get a placement? 
3. If I go into the general engineering stream, is my choice of discipline guaranteed for second year (I won't need to fight for a comp eng spot.)
4. I plan to focus on the programming aspect of comp eng, so with that in mind, should I choose ECEi or general first year?
5. Lastly, in your honest opinion, should I go to Queen's or UOttawa?

Any and all help will be much appreciated, thanks!

8kxgte,119,2018-05-20,Sh*t my mom said this weekend (trigger warning: rape mention),The-jabberwocky,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8kxgte/sht_my_mom_said_this_weekend_trigger_warning_rape/,"So I ended up going home this weekend. But a lot of the comments I got on my post a couple of days ago were really eye opening to me. I asked nicely, and my brother \(amazing\) and sister \(sometimes an issue, but supports me in this\) ended up coming home with me. I spent my first night at a friends instead of my parent's house, and then drove with my brother to my grandparents and stayed there saturday night and tonight. He'll be driving me to the airport tomorrow. So, I got the time with my grandparents I needed and ended up getting to see my siblings as well. I told my mom the reason I wasn't staying with her was because I was uncomfortable and unhappy about the things she'd said to me regarding my health, and I expected it to never happen again if our relationship was to continue, and I was willing to bump my flight up and leave early if she brought it up while I was home.

I got a lot of messages telling me not to go. And I totally get that, that's what I'd tell other people too. But I felt it was important to see my extended family and I knew I'd be safe with my brother \- he's massive and takes no shit. He actually has medical POA over me, because I trust him to follow my best interests if I'm hospitalized and can't self advocate. Also he's my mom's baby, so she does whatever he wants. It was a good weekend. I got what I wanted out of it. But I think I also needed the confirmation that this was going to be my final trip for a while. My spine is just a fledgling right now, and I've been second guessing a lot of my own reactions to my family. I'm going to take a break from seeing my mom for a while. I think it'll be a good thing.

Sorry, this is super long already! Onto the interesting things. I just made a list of the stuff my mom has said to me in the past 48 hours. A lot of this is verbatim, I had it in the notes app in my phone which I could just pull up and add to as needed. 

1. 85&amp;#37; of black babies are born out of wedlock. They're all on crack
2. At least you aren't dating someone covered in tattoos. They never look appealing and you now all people with tattoos are doing drugs and sleeping around. \(Both she and I have tattoos\)
3. People on welfare should be sterilized. You shouldn't reproduce if I have to pay for your kids
4. I keep wondering when people in the black community will get out of drugs and poverty
5. The Obamas had a chance to reinforce values in the African American community and history is going to look back and ask why didn't the obamas who are an example do more to call out their own community
6. \(to me\) don't ever put yourself in a situation where you need an abortion, I know you're making irresponsible choices with your body.           me: I'm just going to remind you that the only time I would have needed to consider that is when I was raped so I think that's an incredibly problematic statement to make.               she then started singing to herself instead of acknowledge me
7. It's not tomato soup it's tomatoes soup \(just like what\)
8. She yelled at me for not saying goodnight to her for the fourth f\*cking time in as many minutes like oh my god woman how many times do you need me to acknowledge that you are going to bed 
9. \(to me\) I noticed you've put some weight on in law school, when are you planning on gettin goff your ass and starting to run again you're so lazy.

And then the biggest thing: My parents both sat me down to talk to me about how they don't approve of me living with my boyfriend starting in the fall. I was like cool, I don't really care about your opinion, I've already signed a lease and I'm not interesting in continuing to discuss this \(was really proud of myself for being assertive\).  They were concerned because my boyfriend is going to be in Germany this summer for an amazing internship, and are convinced he's going to meet some girl during the two months he's there, fall madly in love, and run off, abandoning me, and his dog.... They also said they would be willing to buy out the lease so I could live somewhere else and would pay for that as well, which is frustrating because it shows how they can so easily afford to financially assist me, they're just choosing not to.

And the biggest thing \- my mom kept emphasizing how much she likes my boyfriend, because she likes me better when I'm around him, because I'm nicer and calmer. I just couldn't stop laughing because this is like the fifth time she's talked about the fact that other people experience me differently than she does and she just like doesn't see that she's the common denominator? Like of course I'm a better person around my boyfriend. He's actually nice to me, and my parents are on their best behavior around him. 

I'm so sorry this is so long, I'm just feeling a lot of emotions. It's embarrassing to be around her and to have to constantly tell her that the things she's saying are incredibly inappropriate, and offensive, and just completely incorrect. It's exhausting to be around her and constantly on edge waiting for the next comment about my body or my health or my attitude. I don't want a relationship with her moving forward, and it's such a massive relief to actually acknowledge that.

Even before I knew anything about love I knew that my feelings for her were different. As we grew up we built a close and personal friendship. She was raised in an unstable home, and always found comfort in my relatively mundane, yet normal family. My parents immediately fell in love with her, as her parents did with me. As much as I wanted to discuss my feelings towards her, I was afraid. Not of being denied, but of sabotaging the relationship I had with her. As the years have gone by we have dated other people, moved to different places, but we always wound up back back in our home state. A couple of weeks ago she informed me of an internship in California that she would be going to participate in. I was of course supportive as I truly do want what’s best for her in life. Today, as I helped her pack up the remainder of her belongings, she informed me that she does not intend to move back when the internship is over. I was crushed, but I never let on to my heartbreak. It was then I knew that I needed to tell her the truth. Tell her my feelings, how much she means to me. But I didn’t. I finished helping her pack and move, hugged her, wished her luck, and went home. I have not been able to stop crying since. I’m not sure if I’m more upset that she’s leaving, or that I let her do it without telling her the truth. It was probably my last real chance to ever clear the air."
8kye58,2,2018-05-21,Love is Confusing,Veec_01,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/8kye58/love_is_confusing/,"I wish I had never sent the Snapchat to you, ______. I wish I had never said that I loved you. At least not like that, where it meant so little. I didn't mean it when I sent it, I was just drunk and thought it'd be funny for some reason. You didn't seem to react in much of a way for me to know if you thought it was serious or just a joke. We never even addressed what was said really, we just acted like it didn't happen, which was nice. I wanted to play it off as the typical midnight meaningless drunk snapchat, but I felt like you knew it meant more.

There's so much I regret. I'm afraid to be myself. I’m either way too weird or too uptight around you (or annoying as shit when I'm high). Although I've gotten better, how I act around you leaves me analyzing things I say, wishing I could change them.

I can't believe it's been 3+ years since Costa Rica. Friday at work, you were talking about understanding your sexuality during that trip. The second you mentioned Costa Rica I reminisced over the night Dean, you, and I were sitting outside the back of our beach cabin. I honestly can't remember anything we talked about, but I remember us watching the rain. I remember having to leave and coming back to find you sleeping in a hammock there, so beautifully. I sat there with you watching the rain for what felt like hours, wishing it could last forever. And when you overdosed on your antidepressants I became so frightened, more scared than I had ever been before. I didn't know why I was so fearful at the time.

There had been periods where I had a crush on you, and periods where I thought I didn't. But now I'm not really sure where those periods began or ended, or why. When I heard about you being homosexual back in 9th grade, I felt okay, almost relieved. I was fine with it because I knew it was my sex rather than me holding you from seeing me that way. Then you said, “I’m not, _(me)_, I just love who I love” so passionately, in response to some dumb gay joke I made at my birthday. I thought maybe there was a chance for you to see me in that light. Now it hurts so much more because I know you'll never love me and it's not because I'm a boy, it's because I'm me.

Everything about you is perfect. You're indescribably beautiful to me. I love your smile. Every small quirky thing you do is perfect. I love your dancing, it made me so happy to see you dance during the internship. I wish I had danced with you, but I was doing the uptight thing I do. I love how you nerd out about AC/Batman/Spiderman/Witcher lore, and you get me into it too. I love how you whip whenever you win in a video game. 

I was feeling very emotional when I started writing this a while back. I hadn't been happy those last weeks. In fact, when we went to the mall with my friends to buy a thong for your date, I couldn't handle it… I started sobbing uncontrollably. I don't know why it had to happen then. Ethan caught me and sent Dean off with me to ”use the bathroom,” then, I smoked to suppress my emotions, which I'm not proud of. I truly enjoy seeing you happy, I just wish it was me making you so happy. It was hard for me to listen to you talk about Liz throughout those weeks honestly, and that was so self centered of me, I know. But I think that sensitivity and pain helped me connect the dots to understand how much you mean to me.

I can't say I know what to expect as a reaction from this. I'm certain you'll still be into Liz, because she seems amazing. I doubt you've ever had any sort of feelings for me honestly. I just feel like I need to let you know at some point, because I've kept it in for so long, and in a year you'll be heading off to some amazing music school anywhere while I'll be attending some subpar college nearby. I guess that's all I needed to say. That's how I feel. It may be just a natural response of yours to pull away and avoid me for a while, maybe that's what I need. It's definitely not what I want.

I never showed this to her, the feelings faded some, and I think I'd rather leave it that way and stay friends. But here I am posting it, so... Who knows maybe I'll show it to her some day"
8kykgq,1,2018-05-21,Manuka Honey Singapore,Qadadah66,Manuka_Honey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manuka_Honey/comments/8kykgq/manuka_honey_singapore/,"I would like to welcome you to this post where we will be discussing Manuka honey Singapore. If you'd like to buy some you can visit this link here: 

Manuka honey is superior variety of honey that is produced in New Zealand and Australia. The bees which make this powerful food visit only the flowers of the Manuka bush also called tea tree or jellybush. It is richer and darker than regular honey and has a distinct flavor. 

It has been in use for centuries as a tonic and for treatment for wounds due to strong antibacterial properties. It's use is popular in both traditional and modern medicine for a variety of conditions. 

The question is what is the unique properties of this kind of honey? Why are so many people from Singapore interested in buying this type of honey? The reason simply it is a very nutritious food and is resistant to bacterial but antibacterial effect it has is far superior that other types of honey. Is also quite expensive because it is made by bees that visit only the Manuka flowers. The blooming period of these flowers is less than two months in a year. 

Besides the ingredient known as (hydrogen peroxide), which is responsible for the antibacterial affects of the honey; Manuka honey contains additional ingredients that give it a strong antibacterial effect when used externally. The main antibacterial ingredient in Manuka honey is MG (methylglyoxal). The high concentration of the substance is intern due to the compound called dihyroxyacetone, Which is present in the nectar of Manuka flowers in high concentrations. 

The higher the concentration of MG in the honey the higher its antibacterial effect. This is usually specified as a UMF ( Uninque Manuka Factor). Honey with UMF of 10 or above is called ""active Manuka honey""

This is one of the reasons why Manuka honey in Singapore is growing in interest. 

Here are the many uses of Manuka honey that the people in Singapore or anywhere in the world can be using to treat their conditions:

1. Soothing stomach irritation. 

2. Acidity, bloating and gas. 

3. Ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome. 

4. Maintaining good health 

5. Immune system boost 

6. Prevents infections in wounds 

7. Soothes and cures sore throats 

8. Increase in energy levels- because it is rich in sugars it can boost energy levels. It is better to take it with cereal or whole wheat bread to prevent rapid rise and fall of the blood sugar. 

Your question maybe is there any scientific studies into the effectiveness of this honey? Well, the answer to this is yes. Research conducted in Australia confirms the antibacterial effect of the honey. In a study, it manage to kill different types of bacteria including antibiotic resistant superbugs. It can thus fight infection and speed up healing. It's uses is permitted by the Nation Health Service in the UK for dressing wounds and for medical creams since 2004.

It is also allowed in some countries for reducing inflammation in the esophagus for people taking chemotherapy. I personally have a form of cancer known as Hodgkins Lymphoma and I was diagnosed with it when I was fourteen years old and twelve years on I still have it. 

I used chemotherapy for a great deal of time and I do not recommend it to anyone under any means. I would recommend that you try to treat your condition naturally if you have a form of cancer or any other condition. 

We should also go over some of the side effects of Manuka honey for people in Singapore and other places as well. 

1. Honey is not recommended for children below 1 year of age. 

2. Due to its high sugar content, people suffering from diabetes should not use or very much limited use. 

3. As with any natural medicine allergy is also a small possibility. 

4. A stinging sensation is possible when applied to wounds; that is normal, but it should be used with care on sensitive skins. 

5. Excessive intake of honey may lead to weight gain due to its sugar content. 

It is a superior type of honey due to strong antibacterial properties as we discussed, it is also a good source of energy in antioxidants. You can take it regularly to boost energy and good health and it is also useful for a variety of different conditions. 

The amazing healing role of honey has been recognized since the beginning of time. Even with the current use of medical medicine, the use of honey as an anti-microbial and wound management agent has not lost significance. Honey is a supersaturated solution of sugars (i.e. glucose, fructose, sucrose and maltose), which also contains proteins (i.e. pollen), enzymes (i.e. glucose oxidase), amino acids, minerals and vitamins, and is popular as a natural clinical treatment.

 A broad array of honeys are commercialized (e.g. alfalfa, dandelion, clover, apple blossoms, orange blossoms, manuka, heather, gum, neem, acacia and myriad other wildflowers). Manuka honey is distinguished as the most effective medicinal honey, yet remains largely unexplored. Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) is a shrub belonging to the family Myrtaceae. This plant is a native of New Zealand and South East Australia. The name ‘manuka’ is derived from the Maori language, the indigenous people of New Zealand. 

The plant plant bears white, red or pink flowers  In Southern California, these plants are often found adorning gardens, parks and arboretums. The leaves are often brewed into a tea so it is known as the ‘New Zealand tea tree’. Apart from its aesthetic value, this plant has the reputation as a source of healthy mono-floral honey. Bees collect the flower nectar and process it into honey. Most of this honey is produced in New Zealand and then shipped to other countries like Singapore among many others. 

The unparalleled health value of this honey is ascribed to it phytochemical content of chiefly methylglyoxal, but also levels of hydrogen peroxide and D-glucono-o-lactone which are derived from glucose (oxidation) and propolis. 

Due to its anti-bacterial, wound care, anti-ulcer properties, it is often colloquially known as a ‘healing honey’. Manuka honey is renowned for its prolific ameliorative effects on sore throat, burns, infections, gum problem, acne, indigestion; and gastrooesophageal reflux. This part of this article has been copy pasted from recent published reports with an aim to disseminate the latest research findings on its importance and to stimulate further research into its use as a functional food and medical applications. 

As mentioned, manuka honey displays pathogen inhibition and wound healing actions, evident from the number of research articles comparing it to Portbello honey made in Edinburg (UK), Malaysian tualang honey, Ulmo tree honey from Chile, Greek and Cypriot honeys.

Manuka honey is used both internally and externally. It is marketed as a gel for topical applications (i.e. anti-bacterial, anti-fungal action, wound healing properties), capsules and often re-blended with other functional compounds like propolis.


It is also used as an ingredient in anti-fungal creams for its clinical effect on ringworm and other fungal pathogens, owing to the organic acid content. It is also added to anti-itch creams mainly for its skin mollifying effect against eczema, rashes, bug bites and poisonous plant contact. A plethora of cosmetic products e.g. anti-wrinkle cream, facial cleanser, body lotion, moisturiser, soothing eye gel, lip balm, hand wash and soap contain this honey as a component, presumably for its anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. 

Recent developments in clinical use of manuka honey as a topical anti-microbial and wound healing agent, has been discussed to provide information on its clinical scope.

Bioactive Compounds Manuka honey has been assessed for its nutritional and phytochemical composition, to predict possible clinical uses. 

Methylglyoxal, the aldehyde form of pyruvic acid is the chief anti-bacterial compound in this honey. 

Unique manuka factor (UMF) is quality marker to identify and market unadulterated manuka honey. Kojic acid is known to enhance the properties of known anti-fungal agents.

The Therapeutic Roles of Manuka honey are many such as Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Activities: Oxidative stress (e.g. cell membrane or DNA damage), is caused by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Oxidative stress reduction by manuka honey is well-evidenced. Moreover, internal application possibility of manuka honey against H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activity of raw and α-cyclodextrin-encapsulated manuka honey was shown to inhibit neutrophil TNF-α secretion, and in-turn reduce inflammation. In a trial comparing the anti-oxidant activity of manuka honey with acacia honey from Germany and wild carrot honey, the former was deemed superior in its phenolic content (899.09 mg gallic acid/kg).

It was observed that manuka honey has significantly higher levels of the polyphenols and antioxidant activity than portbello honey (a honey made in Edinburg, UK), even though trials have been conducted on total antioxidant content of the honey, and respective clinical outcomes, further research needs to be conducted. 

The bactericidal effects were treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the bacterial cell Campylobacter causes campylobacteriosis, a disease with symptoms including diarrhoea, cramping, abdominal pain, and fever in the infected patients. 

Furthermore, manuka honey showed inhibition against several wound bacteria e.g. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus Currently, anti-biotic use poses a well established impediment, due to the emergence of resistant bacteria. On the other hand, due to multi-phytochemical composition and the array of differing anti-microbial mechanisms, manuka honey seems well presented to inhibit even antibiotic-resistant ‘superbugs’. 

The anti-microbial and anti-viral effectiveness of manuka honey has been shown across a range of micro-organisms and viruses mainly due to its broad spectrum of phytochemicals present and their varying degree of mechanisms. This may aid in the anti-inflammatory effects on ulcers and wounds. 

Manuka honey also shows anti-ulcer and wound healing. Recurrent wound infections complicate the healing process, and may exacerbate inflammation of the wound site. However, cytokines and other mediators of inflammation may cause ‘out-of-control inflammatory response’ and hamper wound management. Manuka honey has been proven to be an effective agent in healing diabetic wounds, venous ulcers, burns, acne, eczema, psoriasis. 

The effects of manuka honey dressing on the pH and size on non-healing chronic superficial ulcers were studied. Manuka honey (Apinate®) was applied to wounds for 2 week duration. After the specified time, a significant decrease in wound pH (pH 8 to 7.6) was observed, with every 0.1 pH unit decrease was associated with a 8.1% reduction in wound size. Thus, reduced pH promotes wound healing via increased fibroblast activity, inhibition of protease activity and oxygen release. 

Moreover, in a randomized control trial, manuka honey improved wound healing in a patient with sloughy venous leg ulcers. The case of a 55-year-old woman with necrotic lesions of the abdominal integuments and the lumbar area following traumatic colonic rupture was reported. When treated with manuka honey wound dressings combined with the GENADYNE A4 negative pressure wound therapy system, it enabled skin auto-grafting on the wound site and facilitate the wound healing. 

Furthermore, a case study was conducted on a 102-year-old patient with a painful infected venous ulcer complicated by arterial disease. The combination of the superabsorbent KerraMax® (Crawford Healthcare) with the anti-bacterial properties of manuka honey Algivon® (Advancis Medical) created the ideal dressing for the treatment of the mixed aetiology ulcer. It protected the wound site providing an anti-bacterial environment, and inhibiting bacterial growth.

In an animal study, the effect of manuka honey gel in ameliorating the wound in the distal limb of a horse was investigated. The treatment using honey and its gel reduced wound retraction and overall healing time compared to untreated control wounds. The case study of leg injury was reported where manuka honey could stimulate production of collagen and thus repaired the connective tissue (i.e. skin). The honey led to complete healing in two weeks. Its efficacy in managing wound healing raises the possibility of its usage in curing Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by loose joints, fragile skin and blood vessels.

Moreover, the efficacy of manuka honey in the treatment of chronic or recurrent pilonidal sinus disease, an abscess near the natal cleft was investigated.  Out of the 17 patients who  received manuka honey dressing therapy after surgery, 15 achieved complete healing, in a mean time of 65 days.

Moreover, the effectiveness healing of neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers was investigated. A total of 63 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either conventional or manukasoaked dressing. The patients were followed up on a weekly basis for 16 weeks to review the progress of the ulceration. Mean healing time was approximately 31 days for manuka dressing compared to 43 days in conventional dressing. The effect of wound healing may be a culmination of both the anti-inflammatory effect, anti-microbial as well as immunostimulatory effect of manuka honey. 

Anti-tumour Potential: The anti-proliferative activity of manuka honey was investigated on murine melanoma, colorectal carcinoma and human breast cancer cells in vitro.  
The treatment with honey alone resulted in a 33% inhibition of the tumour growth. However, a better control of tumour growth was observed in animals treated with paclitaxel combined with manuka honey (61% inhibition).

Further, gallic acid, an important phenolic acid present in manuka honey has been shown in an alcoholic extract of Potentilla fulgens which reduced Ehrlich ascites tumour in mice and cancer cells via induction of apoptosis by the inhibition of the protein and glutathione lowering effect.

For example, they are very nice towards male medical students that are top of their class or above average but tend to look down on students at there level or below; assuming no romantic feelings for said person.

In addition, there seems to be a segregation among female students. They would form groups and work together but try to leave male student on their team out of things that may benefit them. 

Example of this would be if a patient has an interesting finding on examination. Female students are more likely to only tell their female colleagues about it.

Lastly, there seems to a bit of arrogance and looking down on people, if they perceive themselves to be better than them in that area. And while  a male student is more actively willing to show/help you improve on examination technique or help you out, I often find that female students will just talk down to you like you are an idiot.

So what is up with this behavior among female doctors? I'm not basing my experience on a small group of people but on overall trend I've notice in my 5 yrs in med school and time as an intern."

8l0qkq,5,2018-05-21,CPA Firm Talent Management,tanorstrem,AccountingDepartment,https://www.reddit.com/r/AccountingDepartment/comments/8l0qkq/cpa_firm_talent_management/,"# Managing the Talent Pipeline for CPA firms

Demand for CPA talent is at an all\-time high in public accounting firms everywhere. The proliferation of Advisory, Transaction Advisory Services, and Consulting Practices within firms are creating a shortage across all practice areas, including Audit and Tax. Hiring and retaining these professionals have become more and more challenging for companies that do not have an effective talent management strategy in place.

According to the AICPA’s *2017 Trends in the Supply of Accounting Graduates and the Demand for Public Accounting Recruits* [report](https://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/AccountingEducation/NewsAndPublications/DownloadableDocuments/2017-trends-report.pdf), the number of students entering accounting programs hasn’t changed. Projected accounting enrollment is still at an all\-time high, with no overall change since the record levels seen in 2015\-2016. With a steady population of new graduates and potential CPAs, the opportunity to attract new talent is prevalent. So how does a CPA firm develop a talent management strategy to help manage the pipeline?

## Talent Management Strategy

### 1. Internships:

Sponsoring internships for recent graduates is a good practice for firms interested in growing their talent pool and is quite common among the Big Four. Smaller local CPA firms usually do not offer as many, if any at all, for a number of reasons, i.e., lower budget. However, the firms that do choose to invest in a quality internship program are likely to see a remarkable difference in the ease at which they are able to attract new talent in contrast to the firms that do not.

Internships provide significant value because of the experiences and relationships that form throughout. Most interns are new to the industry and more coachable than the experienced CPAs, so once they are paired with a mentor to learn the business, magic happens. They begin to learn the ins and outs of public accounting, and the growth and development they experience within the program is attributed to the firm. This is a huge advantage to firms as they have the opportunity to hire from within with confidence as they are already familiar with the intern’s work and training.

While starting a paid internship program can seem to be a great deal of work for firms to set up, it is worth the investment. The most exciting part is when the pipeline that forms helps to automate the recruiting process, saving time and money on the back\-end.

### 2. No matter the size of your firm, have a campus presence. 

Tying into the internship strategy – college students should always be a part of the talent management starter pack for public accounting firms, whether local, regional, or national. A strong college presence is essential to having a successful internship program. Students are the best targets for entry level positions and are easy to reach. Having a presence at Beta Alpha Psi, annual job fairs, on\-campus interviews, accounting club meetings, etc. are surefire ways to help students become more familiar with your firm. Neglecting to spend time on college campuses can result in forfeiting a number of talented individuals who might have otherwise been open to joining your team.

Names like PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG should not be the only firms students are aware of upon graduation day. It is the responsibility of local and regional CPA firms to ensure the alternative options are clear. Sure, national firms are known for offering more prestige, better benefits, and a faster partner track than smaller firms. But students should also know that smaller firms can usually offer a better work\-life balance, more diverse work experiences, and a more team\-oriented culture.

### 3. Keep a database of all individuals &amp; candidates met through the interview process, whether an offer was extended or not. Keep in professional contact.

Maintaining a simple database with contact information of the accounting professionals you meet may seem like overkill to some, but it is an important practice. It doesn’t have to be an elaborate process. Using Microsoft Excel or Access will suffice. You can shoot a quick email \(short &amp; sweet\) to get an update on their well\-being, job satisfaction, and/or upcoming career plans at least once per year. You can also send an electronic greeting card around the holidays. This keeps the relationship open and helps to build trust between the individual and your firm. One day, you may find an old candidate’s resume back on your desk or even a referral. Taking simple steps to maintain contact and nurture all valuable relationships you form over the years is an imperative part of the talent management process.

### 4. End of busy season “pruning”.

Just as you prune tomato branches for the health and vitality of the plant and fruit, so should you manage your staff on an as needed basis. Not all CPA firms are “up or out,” but there are times when it becomes apparent a professional is not cut out for CPA life at his/her level.

Busy season also provides a good measure under which to judge a CPA’s competence and capabilities. As one of the most challenging times of the year, due to the heavy workload and long hours, even the most experienced CPAs are subject to burnout. Assisting a CPA with transition to either another firm or into industry can preserve a strong firm image, assist a person for whom you \(at one point\) had aspirations and also very importantly make a firm friend for life.

When committed to hiring, developing, and retaining quality talent, you cannot become complacent. Jobs are finite, and by allowing an undeserving employee the option to hold a valuable position within the firm, you are taking away from a more capable one. And this undermines an effective talent management process.

### 5. Keep an active pipeline of seniors and managers through active recruiting, alumni events and/or contact with external recruiters.

Senior &amp; Manager level Audit and Tax professionals are linchpins to your firm’s success. Utilize your current employees’ network as well as your own to reach talented candidates armed with the skills and knowledge to oversee staff, as well as fill in for, other staff when necessary. Maintaining an active pipeline of CPAs at this level creates a system that works to prevent any major disruptions in the office due to termination, resignation, etc. and saves time on the back end during the hiring process. Due to the diversification in service practices, we are seeing more and more CPAs who have left public accounting “boomerang” back into public. Keeping a robust and active alumni network can help your firm capitalize on this key talent.

## Securing Talented CPAs

Creating a pipeline of quality CPAs requires a strong talent management strategy and can take a while to fully develop. However, once firms have a full grasp on how to maneuver through every step in the process, it makes life much easier for you and your partners. Choosing to take a proactive approach over a passive one eliminates the stress, excess financial cost, and wasted time that plagues those firms that are unprepared when the need for new talent arises."

8l1rrh,1,2018-05-21,47[M4F] Daughter’s roommate,ClearlyALoon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8l1rrh/47m4f_daughters_roommate/,"I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

I'm looking for Vanessa you can choose a different name, if you prefer).... I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are.

Ideally this would go on for a bit. I like buildup.

Ideally I’d find a partner who wants to chat and role play beyond this scenario assuming there’s some chemistry.

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

8l3c8a,2,2018-05-21,I [23F] am losing hope in LDR [22M]. What's the point when the relationship isn't moving forward?,starr17,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/8l3c8a/i_23f_am_losing_hope_in_ldr_22m_whats_the_point/,"REPOSTING FROM R/RELATIONSHIPS because I didn't get much of a response there. And because their advice is always ""just break up"".

Hi reddit. Sorry if this is too long. TL;DR at the end.

I started dating my boyfriend a month before I graduated college (May 2017), although we were friends and saw each other regularly for several months before that. We spent 4 amazing weeks together and were practically inseparable and then I graduated and moved back home (seattle) to start work and find a place to live. My boyfriend moved to San Francisco to start his internship. Despite expressing my hesitations and dissatisfaction with long distance relationships in the past we agreed to stay together. We saw each other 3 times over the summer however he didn't come visit me until August and that was because I invited him as my date to a wedding. In September he moved back to my state for his senior year.

Once he was back at school he was only a 4 hour drive away, so while not exactly convenient it we saw each other much more. About every two weeks. He is my best friend and I thought he was going to be the one and my partner in life. We dont fight, we support each other, we have fun together and we still date each other like it hasn't been over a year now.

BUT I don't like long distance relationships. Every relationship I've been in has been long distance at some point and to me it is just soul crushing. I don't feel like I have any hope or fight in me after all my previous long distance relationships. He wasn't at my graduation, my birthday, Christmas. He's not there for double dates or family dinners. When he visits for the weekend we can't possibly do everything I want to do. We can plan the big things but then we miss out on the small things, the normal date nights and just living life together. But if we spend the weekend not doing anything particularly special then I feel like we're wasting the little time we have together and I don't get to do the big things with my boyfriend. He's also not there after a bad day at work or when I'm sick or upset. He's not here, and I value having someone who is. I feel like I have a more intimate relationship with my cellphone than him. Also just to note, I've told him this from the start and I've made it very clear I don't want to be long distance forever. Sometimes I feel like having no boyfriend is better than having a boyfriend that just isn't there.

THE PROBLEM is he has now graduated (May 2018) and is moving to San Francisco for his job. In the last 6 months we have discussed what we're going to do. At one point I was going to move to SF despite having my roots down here now. Then he was going to apply for jobs here. Then he decided to officially accept his job in SF instead. Then I decided I can't afford to live in SF and have no interest in giving up the lifestyle I have here. Then he decided he'd try harder and find a job here. Well that didn't happen. He had a couple interviews this last month but neither panned out. Now he says he is going to SF until 2019 because he ""doesn't want to abandon his company"". He has also stopped applying for jobs here at all. This completely changes the timeline we had discussed about moving, living together and getting engaged. And I also feel like his arbitrary date in 2019 is going to come and go and he still won't find a job here, especially since he isn't even continuing to apply to job. I feel it's going to come down to me changing my mind and sacrificing to go be with him. Throughout this whole thing I've felt like he's saying one thing but not following through, like he's just waiting for me to go with what he wants. I am happy he has a job and life waiting for him in SF since that's what he wants to do but I don't see a positive outcome for our relationship. The right choice for him alone doesn't mean it's the right choice for us together. 

I am at a loss. He doesn't want to break up and is perfectly fine with the distance. I don't want to break up and am NOT fine with the distance. What's the point of a long distance relationship when it's not moving forward and I'm not happy? At what point do I give up what I actually want to at least have a boyfriend that's present? How can I make long distance work when the only solution I see is ""don't be in a LDR""? How long do I put off my own needs for someone who MIGHT give me what I want later? I'm so tired of being alone and I don't want a part time boyfriend.

TL;DR I've [23F] been in LDR for 11 out of 12 months together with BF [22M]. I don't want to be long distance any longer. He is moving to a different state for work. We discussed alternate options to be together and they just didn't happen. I have no hope or fight left in me. What is there to do?"
8l3idw,8,2018-05-21,What are the odds I can recover from this? How can I address this with potential employers?,kibben,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/8l3idw/what_are_the_odds_i_can_recover_from_this_how_can/,"Hi.  I'm a 2L and I have had a very rough 1L year in terms of my personal and academic life.  My grades from the first semester were good (almost 3.3 GPA); however, things fell apart this year and I completely failed with internship networking and summer job applications and I suspect my grades for second semester will not be great.  With 3 severe illnesses and the death of my mother-in-law, I had to miss more class than the ABA allows and without a special policy instituted by my school which forgives absences for having the flu, I would not have even had an opportunity to pass my classes.  On top of this, if I am honest with myself, I stopped applying for internships and attempting networking due to feeling overwhelmed and disillusioned with what I was learning about from other lawyers about big law jobs and what would be required.  That part is my fault entirely.

I do have an internship now for a local non-profit, but this is not what I want to do with my career.  I also earned a spot on the school's traveling Trial Team for the coming year, but will lose that if my GPA falls below a certain level.  I realize I have missed a lot of opportunities and have probably limited myself so much more if my grades have tanked.  Any tips on how I can address or explain to potential employers why this second semester was so horrible without seeming like a liability?  What are the odds I can recover from this and get a paying internship my 2L summer?  

Any advice anyone could provide would be appreciated.  Thanks."
8l48e3,228,2018-05-21,Theorycrafting: Bachelorette Bios and why ABC sucks,RampagingKoala,thebachelor,https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/8l48e3/theorycrafting_bachelorette_bios_and_why_abc_sucks/,"Hey ABC: GO FUCK YOURSELVES.  Do you know how hard it was to glean things from bios this year?  By removing the individual questions and giving them a tiny paragraph?  You are the absolute worst.  I'm firing up my own personal internet hate machine and I'm ready to rant about this.  Pro tip ABC: if you don't want people reading spoilers all the time, maybe don't churn out this garbage shit for cast bios.  This is probably the biggest hack job I've ever seen in cast bios, and I've seen a lot of them.  They manage to take complex human beings with very deep and rich backstories and narrow them down to one thing, like ""loving Harry Potter"" or ""cologne"".  I'm kind of embarassed I read through all of these if we're being honest.  But I did, so let's glean some statstics:

* The average bachelor age is 28 with a standard deviation of 1.92.  That means most of the bachelors are between 26 and 30.  

* 18 out of the 28 contestants come from either CA or FL.  California has the most people, with 3 from LA, and 2 from San Diego.  However Chicago and Denver also claim 2 apiece.  [Graph is here](https://imgur.com/a/WaRU5Ud).

* 3 contestants have dogs.  No cats.

* 7/29 played sports previously.  Football, baseball, and basketball each have 2 bachelors apiece.  The lone holdover: Christian, playing soccer.

* Of the people who had a favorite activity (there were 18), 9 bachelors listed something involving physical fitness or activities.  Combine that with the athletes who didn't list ""being in shape"" as one of their favorite activities, that gives us 13 athletic dudes.  If you're here for gratuitous shots of men's chests, shoulders, and abs, this might be the show for you.

* 8 contestants had their school listed as something interesting about them.  Of the college-going crowd that listed their alma mater, Florida took home the highest grad count with 2.

* The most prolific career is again anything involving sales, with 5 contestants.  Banker takes home second place, and Pro Football player takes home third, which just goes to show you how varied the career pool is this year.

And that's really it in terms of things I can tell you from statistics.  Because these bios suck.  But let's take a look at some of the hack jobs we've gotten from this year:

Jean Blanc: Moved from Haiti when he was 2, went to Duke, became a mechanical engineer, then in finance.  Pretty great story for a pretty smart guy.  Luckily for him, he will be immortalized by his love of cologne.

Wills: Graphic Designer from UC Davis.  Not so great mustache.  But did you know he loves Harry Potter?

Kamil: Polish immigrant, learned to speak English by watching cartoons.  Now he does real estate and modeling.  But never mind that, he participates in social media!

Grant: Probably the worst one here.  Apparently being a fourth generation electrician and fluent in sarcasm are the only noteworthy things about him.  Literally that's it.  

Jason: A banker from Seattle who loves the Buffalo Bills (ew).  But guys, Disney!  Seriously guys, he loves Disney.

Leo: I bet you want to learn more about his activities as a stuntman, or even his antics in his father's construction company.  Instead, here's how he likes his hair.

Here's one statistic I did pull from these bios: All of the bios focus less on the contestant, but instead use their job as some sort of proxy for having a personality.  As if they are defined by their profession.  The Bachelor has always been pretty reductionist like that, and I'm not really surprised.  But it kind of hurts to see all these guys being reduced to what they do for a living, as if they have nothing more to bring to the table.  At least when we reduce Lincoln to being a floor shitter, we are talking about who he is as a person.  His job has nothing to do with it.  Since when is your alma mater a part of your personality?  I miss the romance questions, like the biggest date fear, 5 things you can't live without, and the meal with 3 people alive or dead.  I get that these were written by some unpaid intern in between coffee runs, but at the very least you could try to make them seem more than just automatons who have ""quirks"".  I'm kind of offended by this, and I know this isn't very statistical but I don't give a shit.  ABC brought this crap on themselves by turning their contestants into stupid one-liners.  ABC seems to have forgotten that doing that is our job, not theirs.  "

8l51gu,6,2018-05-21,[Event] Kazakhstan's 5 Year Plan,d3vilsfire,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/8l51gu/event_kazakhstans_5_year_plan/,"Kazakhstan has one of the highest economic growth rates among the former USSR satellite states, and though we are proud of this accomplishment, it is unfortunate that the main sector of our economy is centered around oil exports. Unfortunately, this is not a sustainable practice as the economic recession from the drop of oil prices has demonstrated. Therefore, we will look to diversify our economy while also promoting internal growth and development. Therefore, the Kazkahstani government has announced a 5 year plan that will hopefully usher in a large amount of economic growth and diversity in our economy.  

**Plans**  

1. Kazakhstan Heavy Industries (Aktobe, Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan possess no heavy industry as we have relied heavily on foreign imports especially from Russia. However, in hopes of diversifying our economy while looking to employ a great amount of Kazakhs, the Kazakhstan Heavy Industries will be founded and considered to be state-owned. The headquarters will be located in the capital city of Astana, while the main manufacturing plant will be located on the outskirts of Aktobe. The headquarters will temporarily take some floors in a pre-existing office building until their HQ can be completed which should take 2 years. The manufacturing plant will be the largest in Kazakhstan by default and take 3 years for construction, but will have 7,500 workers while the HQ will employ a total of 2,500. The total employment for KHI will be 10,000.  KHI will be in charge of building and repairing units like MBT, APC, IFVs, as well as artillery platforms. We would like to set up a partnership with Uralvagonzavod and Kurganmashzavod in order to gain the expertise necessary to build Kazakhstani variants of the BMP-3, T-90, BMPT Terminator, BTR-90, BTR-80, BREM, etc. There are several units that we are looking to simply build domestic variants of in order to boost our domestic industry and promote our own industry.
2. Kazakhstan Light Industries (Taldyqorghan, Kazakhstan): Similar to KHI, KLI will be in charge of manufacturing and repairing the smaller vehicles like Humvees, Marauders, etc as well as manufacturing for the small arms of Kazakhstan. They will also be assuming the license for the construction of the Otokar Cobra. The headquarters will similarly be placed in Astana and take 2 years for construction, while the manufacturing plant will be built in Taldyqorghan and take 2 years to complete. This factory will overall be smaller than KHI, and will only have 4,500 workers in the manufacturing plant, and 1,500 in the HQ. We would like to set up a partnership with Kamaz and Ural in order to build the transportation trucks and logistic vehicles for Kazakhstan. There are several units that we are looking to simply build domestic variants of in order to boost our domestic industry and promote our own industry.
3. Kazakhstan Aircraft Corporation (Saryshagan, Kazakhstan): Similar to KHI and KLI, this state-owned company will be in charge of the manufacturing and repairing of all air equipment of Kazakhstan. Built similar to KHI, KAC will have a HQ located in Astana, while the manufacturing plant will be in Saryshagan. The HQ will take 2 years to build while the manufacturing plant will take 3 years. Employment levels will be 2,500 for the HQ and 7,500 for the manufacturing plant. We ask for Sukhoi and Mikoyan to set up a partnership with KAC in order to gain the necessary experience to do local manufacturing of air equipment. From Sukhoi we would like to eventually build the Kazakhstani variant of the Su-35 and Su-25. From Mikoyan we would like to eventually build a Kazakhstani variant of the MiG-35. There are several units that we are looking to simply build domestic variants of in order to boost our domestic industry and promote our own industry.  
4. The Chinese are well known for their rigor and excellent education system, something that the people of Kazakhstan feel is not achievable in Kazakhstan and would rather go to Russia for their education. Therefore, we would like to ask China to help us construct new universities in Kazakhstan along with the aid in revamping our university curriculum in order to improve them. There will be a new university in every region of Kazakhstan except for Almaty which boasts the top 2 universities in Kazakhstan. This construction plan will consist of 13 new state universities that fall under the new University of Kazakhstan program. Each region will have a new University of Kazakhstan built, but each will be unique to the region i.e. University of Kazakhstan, Karagandy. Though listed as a separate city, the University of Kazakhstan, Astana will be considered the university for Akmola region and be the flagship campus of this new program. It will take a total of 5 years to build all the new schools. Each one will be tailored in size according to the region and the expected attendees, but the curriculum and rigor will remain consistent. The idea is to provide the Kazakh people top tier institutions in Kazakhstan so that they are not inclined to leave, as well as providing the universities closer to home to help with costs and convienance. Technology, science, and medicine will be the main focus for these schools, but various majors will be offered. 
5. In hopes of boosting local start-ups as well as private foreign investments, the government of Kazakhstan is willing to provide initial subsidies and aid for companies willing to start up or establish a presence in Kazakhstan. We would like to promote diversity in our economy and feel that inviting foreign companies will aid us in this development.  
6. Technological development will be the key focus for these 5 years. Improving our research and pushing the edge of technologies capabilities is a great way to improve our economy and establish ourselves in the world. Technology is the future, and a much more sustainable than oil. Universities will push hard for technological majors and the government will encourage companies to hire more tech based majors. KHI, KLI, and KAC will be setting up internship programs through the University of Kazakhstan system in order to help improve the education of our university students and speed up the learning and capabilities of our workforce. The hope is that the students learn a lot and can contribute, and then when they graduate they join KHI, KLI, or KAC instead of leaving for Russia. "
8l536f,59,2018-05-21,Final Thoughts on Season 14 and How I Feel Going Forward,fakesnakesablaze,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/8l536f/final_thoughts_on_season_14_and_how_i_feel_going/,"As I bow out of the discussion here on Reddit on ways in which Grey's could be a better show, I wanted to highlight some of my final thoughts on this season and the show going forward.

Even if Krista had kept April and Arizona, I still don’t believe that we would get well-developed stories going forward with this show. Season 14 has been fun and light-hearted and certainly had a lot of nice little moments, but I’m not invested in most of the characters anymore because their stories have not been told well. Nothing in this season seemed to hold any weight past the episode it happened in, and while that’s certainly better than the prolonged storytelling of season 13, it doesn’t develop characters in an authentic way. 

Amelia’s brain tumor was a storytelling copout and didn’t do anything to move the character forward since she needed to actually have more development before doing anything further with her and Owen. And though her arc with Betty is exactly the kind of development I've been wanting for Amelia, I just feel like it's too little too late, especially since it's so wrapped up in a retread of Omelia.

I actually really liked the DV storyline for Jo when Paul showed up but it was just way too much on top of her already complicated backstory. But we have jo marrying a guy that has violent tendencies. I know Alex beating up DeLuca is something we all want to forget but it happened and they showed Alex getting violent again this season. If jo is going to have an abusive ex then the effects of that should be part of her character. She should worry when Alex expresses his anger in physical ways and maybe she could seriously encourage him to seek counseling if he wants to be with her. And in all this jo really needed some character development outside of her relationship. She needed to explore different specialties and get a BFF that was also her boyfriend's bestie. And the way her friendship finally developed with Mer felt fake given how poorly Mer treated her for years. 

Maggie had so much potential, but her character development has been piss poor as well. She is a very nice and cheery character, but she is also very focused on her ego and cannot seem to get past her concern of what others think of her. She also seems to struggle with really understanding others, so her connection with others always feel a bit shallow. 

Carina and DeLuca are basically just eye candy. 

The interns aren’t bad, but if they are going to take over the show in x number of years they aren’t being developed for that at all. We don’t have any idea how the interns feel about one another and none of them have built any kind of friendship or mentorship with the main cast. Assuming a year has passed for them they should have established their place amongst the cast better. 

Owen had a great story with his sister coming home in this season, but it seems like the growth he experienced from that was undercut by him musing about why he ended things with Amelia and him rushing off to teddy on Amelia’s suggestion. 

Alex has been a great character, but it feels like they really made his character so tame just not give people any reason to dislike him for the whole Deluca mess. He doesn’t seem to be progressing all that much even though he and jo have been a nice couple. I felt like Alex just blindly going wherever for Jo was a turn that they came too a little too lightly as well. 

Mer was a great character, but I felt like I fell in love with her because she wasn’t sure what the right thing to do was and this Mer that is just a wise sage in the background feels like a completely different character. I think her story as a widow has been interesting, but I don’t think her story has been enough to carry the show in this Mer centric world they are creating. Her Harper Avery win felt unearned, especially since Cristina worked her ass off for it and the reason she didn’t win still should have been a factor. Mer is living in this world post having gotten everything she initially wanted and I don’t see her story developing into new drives. And her character was made better by having Cristina and Derek to play off of. Alex was great post-Cristina but lately, Alex doesn’t feel like enough of a push for her. And of course, my biggest issue with her character is that the writers seem to be retconning the idea that this show is all about her. Mer is a central figure, but she functions best as the glue for an ensemble, especially since her story these days is more subtle. But in the last few episodes, she feels like an imposing presence on moments that should be focused on other characters.

Arizona is a fantastic character that has been a little meh on storyline since the exit of Sara Ramirez, but she has these great relationships with Alex and April and a very well established career arc, that makes her an easy addition to the show, even if I don't care about her post Callie love interests. She could have left and preserved her character’s legacy, but I didn't feel like they were edging on that at all. 

And April just out of nowhere became one of my favorites. I hated her for a few seasons, but her growth with Japriet and her career arc from meek admin assistant person to badass trauma surgeon was inspiring and I loved seeing her find ways to incorporate her organizational skills into a truly chaotic role. April has a mentor in Owen, a love interest/co-parent in Jackson, and a BFF
in Arizona. And Sarah Drew is one of the most talented actresses on this show. With her acting and April’s kindness she could have done so much to help develop other characters. Even if Japril wasn’t endgame, I think seeing her move onto a new love interest or even Matthew would be an interesting journey to take with her. And I can’t help but feel bitter than Krista didn’t see the potential there. And that she seemed to reduce April to a one-note Christian character who needed to be with another one-note Christian character (Matthew can’t punch Jackson because of the Christian thing, instead of Matthew just being a truly good person...). And not giving April a new career step that honors all of the hard work she put into her career on the show. Why not run the organization that helps homeless people receive medical care? 

So here we are going into a new season with only a handful of characters that were introduced before they stopped giving a shit about a character development, all paired off with characters who can’t foil them as well as their previous scene partners. And we have a showrunner who just doesn’t seem to care about long-term arcs, moves too quickly through big issues, and loves to wrap up stories in the neatest way possible without earning any of it. And different visions for where the story is headed is clearly a factor, but I think most fans are upset because it feels like the writers are more concerned with their own whims than being loyal to characters and a story that we fell in love with. I don’t get the impression that Krista loves this story, and wants to carry it out. I feel like she’s more interested in making the story hers even if it doesn’t track with what came before. 

I’m not mad, but I do think that Krista has wasted a lot of opportunities to tell a truly wonderful story, and that’s just such a bummer for all of the people that have contributed to making this show one that people really love. I’m curious about where they will go, but I’m not invested in the characters they have left and if I do continue watching it will be as a complete guilty pleasure and not quality television. 

Thank you, Grey's sub for all of this engaging commentary on a show I really love. I hope to return when I decide to do another rewatch of the earlier seasons and relive some of the ""MAGIC"" that once was.  "
8l5vqp,22,2018-05-21,New friends in dubai?,trojankid1123,dubai,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/8l5vqp/new_friends_in_dubai/,"Whats up!

20 M here. I'm from Australia. 

Honestly, I'm struggling to make new friends here in Dubai. In the strict sense, I do have ""friends"" but they are not good for me, in the sense that, they don't listen to me when I tell them bad news, often derailing the conversation. They don't help me celebrate when I tell them good news - its like - something good happens and I'm afraid of sharing it because it might get ""taken away"" from me (if that makes any sense). 

I need to meet more people and test out these friendly relationships - trying to find people who are interested in meeting up, maybe a quick shisha sesh? 

What has your experience been with making friends in Dubai? 

A little about me:
I play guitar - I listen to any music really, but especially oldies like The Beatles or Rolling Stones or Elton John etc. (I'm not weird I do listen to Drake and Kendrick and Kanye occasionally lol)

I study in the US - majoring in Finance. I have an internship lined up in IB this summer, so I'm excited for that! 

Anyway, if you're interested or can give me any advice, post a comment below!"

I've started therapy but I'm only just starting my journey. 

The first thing I'm grappling with, the subject of today's post, is most likely at heart of my other issues. For a long time I willingly and easily bent my physical appearance into something pleasing to my parents, namely my mother because she was the one vocally critical enough of me to influence me to change. I didn't mind this at all and didn't even really notice it while I lived at home, because only my external appearance changed; I still listened to the same music, read the same books. 

I'm now away at college, and a thousand miles away from them. I choose to do what makes me happy now unimpeded by any other influences, but I realize that a lot of the things(and people) that make me happy cause me to face disapproval once again from my mom. 

I'm extremely, extremely self-conscious. I crave approval and praise. Not only that, but I fear not having it from my parents most of all. I fear the ramifications of doing things that displease my family because I've been told on no uncertain terms from multiple people, regarding multiple situations, that if I go against their wishes I will not be treated the same and it'll be no one's fault but my own. They're merely reacting to what I do; which in my case, has to do with the way I dress, the way I wear my hair, if I get any piercings, if I get any tattoos, and if I stay with my current boyfriend whom I love very much. 

I'm trying to find closure. I think I've resolved this ongoing(2 year) conflict as much as it can be. My mother feels how she feels and I feel how I feel. I think it would be wrong of me to ask my mom to change her convictions or change her opinions on things, and I've expressed to her that that's not what I want; I told her that I only wanted to know that she'd be able to look at me and be proud of me, that she'd be comfortable with me and still treat me the same if I decided to change my appearance a little bit. She couldn't, but at least now I know that.

Her position has always been, ""do what you want, do what you're going to do and you don't need to care about what I think."" I agree with that to a point, but then she follows up with ""and if you're feeling so upset and conflicted about doing something, maybe you shouldn't be doing it."" I know what I'm doing, I'm happy I'm doing it, but I don't like feeling like I'm losing my mother's acceptance and comfort by doing what I want. I don't like thinking that I might not be welcome to see my family in the future, if I continue to upset them by doing things they don't like.

I wrestle with this, but I made my decision. I cut my hair short last Thursday. ""Boy-short,"" as my family would say. I've been thinking about getting more piercings, I've decided on my first two tattoos and where I want them. I'm thinking about dying my hair as soon as I get a good chance where it won't affect internships or work. 

I want to move on from this and here is my start."

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I'm studying Computer Science and I'm on the verge of being kicked out of the engineering program. I haven't had a single semester of college where I haven't failed a course. I failed Calculus 1 twice, Calculus 2 once and my Intro to Programming in C\+\+ course once \(after withdrawing once before\).

I'm currently in finals week and I'm confident that I'll pass Calculus 2 this time as I have done significantly better than in the past, but i'm failing my Probability and Statistics course. I'm also potentially failing my Data Structures class \(unless I basically beg for a D in the course\). More or less all of my programming projects have been ripped from somewhere or put together by me with the little knowledge I have.

I don't have the guts to tell my family that the ""engineer"" that they're putting so much faith in is a complete fraud. I come from a poor family and I'm able to afford college by means of opportunity programs. As the first person in my family to attend college, everyone in my family has such high hopes and expectations that it gives me an insane amount of anxiety knowing the reality of my situation.

I could never bring myself to tell my poor old illiterate mother that her son is on the verge of getting kicked out of engineering school. She would be devastated. Although she's the most supportive person in my life, I don't know that she would support me in my last two years of failure. 

I can't even begin to pinpoint exactly where it all went wrong. I know that I can do anything I put my mind towards, and I've always been passionate about engineering. Computer Science is the career of my dreams but I've had no motivation to do anything to progress academically. I've been going through the motions of college but I'm otherwise clueless. Seeing all of my friends get closer and closer to achieving their dreams by excelling academically just destroys me because I know that that could be me if I just had the motivation and didn't chronically procrastinate.

Never in my academic career have I been a 4.0 straight A student, but I've always stayed on top of my studies up until my freshman year of college. My current GPA is a 2.8 and while that may not seem as low as I make it out to be, this is after a series of retakes in which F's that I've earned have been dropped. I'm sure that my GPA would be closer to a 2.0 if I considered the F's that I've accumulated.

I feel like the epitome of wasted potential. I've destroyed my academic record and ruined any of the opportunities that I dreamed of one day achieving. No internships want me and I've sent out countless job applications but I've yet to hear back at all. 

I have to lie to the few friends I have in college because if they knew the grades that I've been getting I know their perception of me would crumble. I've been living a lie, telling my friends that my GPA is higher than it actually is, all to maintain an appearance. People see me as outgoing, knowledgeable and confident when in reality I'm nothing more than a liar.

All of my friends have been getting accepted to internships and when they ask me about my internships I have to lie and say that I'm waiting for an interview because I can't be upfront and tell them that there's no way anyone would hire me to code a single line of anything. 

I've lived a life that I can't complain about. My mother did everything she could to raise me comfortably with what little resources she had. I've never had depression and I've never experienced any self loathing up until now. I'm currently experiencing what I can only imagine is the lowest point in my life and it's all just falling apart. 

My father died when I was about to turn 7 years old and told my mother that his dream was to one day see me a college graduate. I feel like I'm dishonoring his very memory with my disgraceful failures. 

One of my goals upon starting college was to reinvent myself and get into shape. I've always been overweight and wanted to start to get into shape in college. Now, 4 semesters later, I'm currently at my heaviest at around 265 pounds. I can't stand to look at myself. I can physically feel my failures weighing me down. I feel and look terrible. 

I just want another chance to start over again and do everything right. I want to salvage what little I have left of my dignity and become the engineer that I know I could have been if I had done everything correctly."
8l6rcw,3,2018-05-21,Project management system for a small nonprofit,contrasupra,productivity,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/8l6rcw/project_management_system_for_a_small_nonprofit/,"I apologize in advance that this is incredibly long, but hopefully someone has an idea! I am the Assistant Director of a very small nonprofit - 2.0 FTE (me and my boss) plus the occasional intern. Because we're so small, everything is my job - I need to manage our substantive projects, as well as things like fundraising, communications, general operations, etc. I find myself drowning between a million different lists and notes, and need a way to track projects and other information and somehow see everything at once so I know what we need to focus on from week to week. I played around in Trello, but I found that the boards were too isolated from each other, and there wasn't a good way to create a high-level overview of everything that's going on.

Here's some details about my needs:

* I am in a staff of two, but I really just need an individual license, since staying on top of stuff for the org is basically my job. When my boss and I have a staff meeting I need to be able to say, ""These are our highest priorities this week,"" but she doesn't need to actively collaborate with me and we don't need to be able to see what each other are doing in real time. Also, since we're a teeny tiny nonprofit, it basically needs to be free or VERY cheap.

* However, in order to say, ""These are our highest priorities this week,"" I need some kind of dashboard that somehow lets me see everything at once. This is really critical - a huge problem that's emerging is that we have goals and timelines for different projects or areas of work, but no great way to see how they interact with each other. It would help to be able to look at these things over time, maybe on a week-by-week basis. My fiance is a software developer, and we adopted the idea of a weekly sprint from him, which we really like, but we struggle with staying on top of what actually has to appear in our sprint from week to week. So suppose we have a board meeting on July 15, we need to start thinking about it and prepping for it probably around June 15. That's not exactly a task, and it's not exactly a project - it's just some kind of tickler to tell me, ""This needs to enter your weekly priority rotation around now."" This is where Trello fell apart for me.

* I need to track active tasks but also overviews of our substantive projects, which can be very different. For instance, a few of our current projects right now are creating a legal self-help publication, organizing a symposium and workshop on a substantive topic, and helping a partner organization draft and support a bill they're bringing to the state legislature. These projects all have very different roadmaps and strategies, and the planning tends to be pretty dynamic. I need to know what the concrete action items and major deadlines are, but also get some sense of the general state of play for that project so that I can quickly figure out what to do next. 

* Ideally I would also like to be able to capture decisions and information that isn't immediately actionable, but will be in the future. So for instance, suppose we have a conversation in April where we decide to send out our Q2 newsletter in late May and brainstorm a few things we could include. What's happening now is that we get to early May and one of us says, ""Didn't we have a conversation about the newsletter a few weeks ago?"" and then we're digging around in notes from past staff meetings trying to find it, or we end up having the same conversation twice. When I tried to build my workflow in Trello, I created a card called ""Q2 Newsletter"" where I put the details of that conversation in the description so that if I need to know about Q2 Newsletter, I know where to find it and that everything relevant is there. That seemed to work fine, but Trello had other shortcomings for me as I explained above.

* Another example of the previous point - suppose I'm having a conversation with my boss and she says, ""oh, next time we talk to Project Partner Dave, we should ask him about X."" Assuming X isn't urgent, this isn't exactly a task - I don't need to call Dave right now. I just need to remember to ask him about X next time we talk. Where does that reminder live?

Sorry again that this is so long and complicated - if anyone read this far, let me know if you have any recommendations!"

My current GPA is a 2.8 and while that may not seem as low as I make it out to be, this is after a series of retakes in which F's that I've earned have been dropped. I'm sure that my GPA would be closer to a 2.0 if I considered the F's that I've accumulated.

I feel like the epitome of wasted potential. I've destroyed my academic record and ruined any of the opportunities that I dreamed of one day achieving. No internships want me and I've sent out countless job applications but I've yet to hear back at all.

I have to lie to the few friends I have in college because if they knew the grades that I've been getting I know their perception of me would crumble. I've been living a lie, telling my friends that my GPA is higher than it actually is, all to maintain an appearance. People see me as outgoing, knowledgeable and confident when in reality I'm nothing more than a liar.

All of my friends have been getting accepted to internships and when they ask me about my internships I have to lie and say that I'm waiting for an interview because I can't be upfront and tell them that there's no way anyone would hire me to code a single line of anything.

I've lived a life that I can't complain about. My mother did everything she could to raise me comfortably with what little resources she had. I've never had depression and I've never experienced any self loathing up until now. I'm currently experiencing what I can only imagine is the lowest point in my life and it's all just falling apart.

My father died when I was about to turn 7 years old and told my mother that his dream was to one day see me a college graduate. I feel like I'm dishonoring his very memory with my disgraceful failures.

One of my goals upon starting college was to reinvent myself and get into shape. I've always been overweight and wanted to start to get into shape in college. Now, 4 semesters later, I'm currently at my heaviest at around 265 pounds. I can't stand to look at myself. I can physically feel my failures weighing me down. I feel and look terrible.

I just want another chance to start over again and do everything right. I want to salvage what little I have left of my dignity and become the engineer that I know I could have been if I had done everything correctly."

8l6y9q,11,2018-05-21,Similarities Between Deadpool 2 and Tokyo Ghoul,Monsur_Ausuhnom,TokyoGhoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/comments/8l6y9q/similarities_between_deadpool_2_and_tokyo_ghoul/,"FYI The following argument is an analysis, describing the similarities between Deadpool 2 and Tokyo Ghoul.  I recommend seeing Deadpool 2 to understand my argument fully.  You may gain insight about the importance of paying attention to wind advisories after repeated viewings of Deadpool 2. MASSIVE SPOILERS BELOW.


Deadpool 2 is a great movie.  Over the past month, I have seen a great deal of comparisons of TG to videogames and the marvel universe, particularly Avengers Infinity Wars.  There are similar themes present in Tokyo Ghoul that are indeed present in Deadpool 2.  

 The first is being self-aware and various pop culture references 

Like Furuta, Deadpool is aware of being in a Marvel comics universe.  Furuta is largely aware of the manga series Gintama and seems to have read a wide repertoire of manga that makes him just as self-aware and this gives him great power without any great responsibility that comes with it, unless that's Godzillas or chaos.  Deadpool is similar in the sense that he fights Cable, who epitomizes the standard, gruff attitude of someone that follows a standard formula that Deadpool can use to his advantage, just like Furuta. 

""YOU'RE SO DARK ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT FROM THE DC UNIVERSE?""-Deadpool speaking to Cable after being stabbed by him

Naturally, these various pop culture references aren't looked at as a strength by other characters.  It would be deemed ""annoying"" and ""trolly"" by other's in the Marvel universe (as in the X-Men cameo where Professor Xavier and Beast ignore him).  Nevertheless, both Furuta and Deadpool have this power and that's part of their strength. 

Where Deadpool finds similarities to Tokyo Ghoul is its large focus on abusive, dysfunctional relationships.  Naturally, Deadpool and Vanessa are dysfunctional people, but what's most important for both stories is to overcome this initial trauma and to become a great person.  The shock of Vanessa's death sends Deadpool into a downward spiral that ultimately results in him trying to blow himself up in the opening credits, but like Kaneki he overcomes his own problems, attempted suicide, and manages to save the day at the end (still pending for Kaneki).  (It can be argued that Deadpool really just saved Russell because ""he had been trying to die for awhile"" and may have just been another suicide, but it was heartfelt and a major moment of development for his character) Nevertheless, this is a passionate scene that leads to the next point.  

Grey vs. Grey morality

Immediately, Colossus reminds me of a standard  black and white character that is Amon. A standard paragon that is like Colossus and does just like Amon, in the movie, have a crisis of faith.  In the film, we are led to the orphanage where Russell wishes to kill the headmaster.  Colossus has spent most of his time trying to make Deadpool ""a good person,"" but we see the flaws of his own belief systems, which are refined and remade by Deadpool toward the end of the movie.  If Deadpool sides with Colossus, then Russell is sent back to the Headmaster where he will be repeatedly tortured and abused by the ssame headmaster, which caused his own rage and evil that would lead him to become the same man that would kill Cable's family in the future and cause that very Cable to go back in time to the past to kill Russell and to prevent that from happening.  After Deadpool, hears this story of abuse firsthand, he has a change of heart and proceeds to kill the abusers at the orphanage sending Russell and himself to the icebox, a maximum mutant security prison where Cable shows up from the future to kill Russell. 

Colossus is angry at Deadpool and finally gives up on him.  However, Deadpool tries to save Russell because he understands that same abuse that he went through.   Deadpool uses Peter Gabriel ""In Your Eye's"" to get Colossus to come out of the X-Men Mansion and inspires him into action.  Eventually, Colossus relents and changes his own morality, deciding  ""to fight dirty.""  This in a lot of ways reminds me that some choices that may be called ""grey vs. grey morality"" are sometimes the best options to use.  Following Colossus reasoning, that would have meant that Russell kills the headmaster and turns into an evil mutant that kills Cable family.  It's only thinking outside this morality of black and white that saves Russell.  Deadpool understands Russell and this becomes immediately apparent when they both say a ""Robocop reference"" at the same time in complete synchrony.

Another area is the idea of hypocrisy.  One main rule is that Kaneki does not want to eat humans, however, he eats a ton of ghouls and is okay with this.  The same hypocrisy although not of the same level of eating people, is Deadpool's preference of Peter over Dopinder. Dopinder wishes to be a mercenary, but Deadpool doesn't allow this.  However, Peter is immediately given a spot on the X-Force, which causes taxi cab driver Dopinder to be enraged.  Ultimately, Dopinder runs over the headmaster with the taxi to prove his worth to Cable, Deadpool, Domino, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and Colossus.  At times, Deadpool encourages this behavior from Dopinder so its again difficult to know what he wants.  

The status of being normal is rendered as being okay.  This is a positive message like Tokyo Ghoul.  There have been plenty of heroes that are just normal.  One great example is Hide, a normal human and intern, like Peter, that sees an ad and jumps on it.  Not to long after, Peter is skydiving out of an aircraft carrier and landing on the highway rather flawlessly.  Hide is now the right hand man of Marude or actively in charge of the CCG.  Sometimes, you don't need to be a superhero you can just be a normal human that has extreme perception and be pretty talented and stylish, like Hide or Peter.  

Now, to tie this up is the common ground of backstory.  Deadpool and Cable are polar opposites.  What brings them together is a similar tragic backstory.  Vanessa is killed at the beginning and Cable's family is killed.  This is very similar to Touka's and Akira's backstory.  Both childhoods were shaped by loss and father's that wished to kill the opposite side.  Both father's lost their lives and its this understanding that brings them together.  It's the same for Deadpool and Cable, accept Deadpool has been ripped in half by Juggernaut and is regenerating his body.  He takes baby steps with new legs and shakes Cable's hand.  

However, the biggest theme imo is the importance of being a family.  In both works, there is a sense of camaraderie in working together and creating a family, which enables Cable to save Deadpool in the end.  It's by working together and caring for other's that one overcomes their own abuses and traumatic loss. This is where both Tokyo Ghoul and Deadpool 2 work brilliantly as artistic mediums to establish their points and themes across the duration of their films and chapters. 

TL;DR 

There's a lot of similarities between these two.  They both explore being self-aware, pop culture references, their focus on abusive relationships, the importance of being normal, grey vs. grey morality,  explorations of hypocrisy, and overcoming dysfunctional, traumatic childhoods through similar backstories.  Both convey hope in overcoming drastic obstacles and their theme of making a family for their characters.  As in relying on each other and not being able to do it alone.

Wall of text incoming!

**TL;DR**: *Looked up to a priest like a father. I wasn't perfect, I made some mistakes. He cut me out of his life without a chance to even explain myself while I was at my weakest, causing me to to abandon my faith for a few years but I realized Christ is bigger than his Church and the people running it and found my way back into the fold despite one bad shepherd. And so can you!*

Without going into too many deep details, I developed a professional relationship with a priest who quickly became a mentor figure, and in many ways, a father figure to me. It started in college when I worked as an intern in a program he was leading. For my entire college career, I held this internship.  I made friends with a few other priests, but they weren't on the same level as him. He had amazing insights to share about myself that I never realized, he considered me to be the brightest of all interns he has had, and seemed to be grooming me for a post-education job in my field of study. He has connections like that.

Towards the end of college an error on the part of my departmental director left me short a handful of credit hours, so I had to choose to double up on classes and delay my thesis writing, or do the thesis and dish out a small fortune for one more semester. I chose to double up, thinking I would be able to finish the thesis in no time. Unexpectedly, a parent became gravely ill, which caused me severe mental distress.

I was able to finish my classes with flying colors, but couldn't get my head in the mental space to start my thesis. To make matters worse, my parent asked me to come home to take care of them, which meant dropping everything in my life to move back home. I did so. You don't make excuses, you just take care of them, right? I saw my priest-mentor for the last time after mass five years ago. I broke the news that I had to go home to take care of my parent with teary eyes, and I would be leaving in the morning. He told me to call him, and that was it. I went home, packed, and was headed home by the crack of dawn.

Taking care of someone dying from cancer is very stressful, so within two weeks I called him for any words of encouragement I could get. My call went to voicemail. I texted him, as I had often done. No reply. I sent an email. No reply. Weeks went by, and my parent died. I called and left another voicemail that clearly said my parent had died and I was devastated and needed someone to talk to. Nothing. Another text. Nothing.

On my own, I planned the funeral and burial. On my own, I took care of finances and cleaning out the place they lived. With no job, no home, and an incomplete college degree, I had no choice but to move in with my other parent. It was very stressful as I hated the state the other parent was in, and I hated having to go into retail to make ends meet. Due to the trauma of losing my parent, loosing my education, loosing my job security, an loosing my sense of direction, I suffered a genuine mental breakdown. I was worn down, terrified, and felt so alone. I couldn't read, write, or do any sort if thesis research. My brain was just broke.

It was then, about a month after the death, that I got a reply to my first email. One sentence was dedicated to acknowledging the difficulty of losing a loved one. The rest of the email, several paragraphs, was dedicated to explaining how disappointed in me he was. How I had thrown away opportunities. As you can imagine, this was a further blow to my spirit as I was already spiraling out of mental control.

As a result, I questioned everything he had ever said to me or about me. Was I ever really smart? Was I ever really a good student? Was I ever really likeable? Did I ever have a shot at any of  the stuff he made me think  I did? Was I even a good Catholic? How could I be if this priest was so willing to drop me like a bad habit for something so seemingly trivial, especially in the face of what I was going through? I began questioning if I could even trust another priest when he said nice things about love and forgiveness at the ambo but couldn't even bother to be there for me at my weakest and neediest moments.

I stopped praying. I stopped going to mass. I stopped caring about anything I had learned about what it meant to be Christian. I turned to drugs and alcohol for comfort as my mind deteriorated. I became angry and depressed beyond belief. Over the years, by the grace of God, I slowly came back around. I returned to the sacraments, to mass, to prayer. I began to trust people again. I began to trust myself again. And love myself again.

And, recently, I decided enough time had passed that I could return to the place where I was a student and his intern. I wanted to see everyone else there who had made me feel good about myself and who loved me. I spoke to one of the other priests I had met, and he told me I should email my former mentor. He didn't know about what I have detailed here, but he knew we hadn't talked in a while. He said he told that priest that I was around, and said he seemed very surprised by it.

So I emailed him and expressed a desire to just meet up and say hello. I was available for a few days. He never replied. It has been a few weeks and he still hasn't replied. I'm not upset or mad. I'm just disappointed. So what's the point of sharing this with you all?

It is easy to look up to a priest and expect him to be perfect. It is easy to expect the best. You should, they are meant to be a bridge to Christ and not a wall between you and Christ. But priests are *not* Christ. Sacramentally, they can act as Christ when performing priestly functions, but being ordained doesn't make them good people or nice people. Don't allow any priest, religious brother or sister, catechist, or whatever to have such control over your soul and emotions. When they let you down, you'll feel like God has let you down but that isn't true.  Always trust God. He is always faithful, despite the people he calls to serve him being flaky.

I hope no one is in a similar situation, but if you are or have been, just pray and keep up the sacraments. It's all that matters. See Christ in the priest but don't expect the priest to be Christ all the time or you'll be disappointed! "
8l7i9d,31,2018-05-22,"Too Sick to Travel, Yet Everything is in My Head, According to My Mother",icariansav,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8l7i9d/too_sick_to_travel_yet_everything_is_in_my_head/,"Hey! I've been following this for a good bit, first time posting. Mostly because my \[21F\] mother \[51F\] has, how should we say, officially made me exhausted. Like absolutely done with her shit. 

Now, for some context, for a very long time, I thought it was normal for your mom to literally dump all her issues onto her eldest child after they've turned 18 like they were her therapist. She specifically referred to it as us *developing a friendship \-* whatever that means. I also thought it was normal for mothers to get so damn mad at their children for not doing well in school, constantly checking their grades, and other invasive things, like going through my cellphone whenever the hell she felt like doing so. It wasn't until I started dating my SO, who almost immediately bared witness to one of her tirades in the midst of SO and my skype call. 

Since that point, SO and her siblings have dubbed my mother ""The Keeper"" \(TK\), so that's what I'll be referring to her as that for the duration of this.

It all started with some health issues that came up during my spring semester at college this year. After going round and round at Urgent Care, ER, and a walk\-in clinic and still getting no answers, I caved when The Keeper offered to pay for a plane ticket for me to fly back to her house so I could go to the doctor and get everything sorted out. 

I was initially upset because it completely threw off my summer plans, in which originally SO and I were going to get to spend a month together before I had to return to my home state and go to some internship that TK lined up for me, after which I'd go back to see my SO before starting my Fall semester. TK instead made me a deal: if I could afford a flight back to SO after my doctor's appointment if I paid for the ticket and made it convenient for her to get me to the airport. 

The Dr wound up calling for some testing and imaging, which was fine, since at that point all I wanted was answers. After getting some, I was excited. I could go see my SO, just in time for her birthday! I approached TK about what dates might be good to fly out, offering the day before my SO's birthday, since there was nothing on the Family Calendar. Oh god, was that a mistake. She flipped out, saying I didn't give a shit about her, only wanting what was convenient for me and SO. Because god forbid I not know about a housewarming party for her BF's brother! So I backed down, though upset. 

Now, the main reason I was originally spending a month with SO was not only her birthday, but also because her sibling graduated during my stay. So, two days ago, I decided to ask if I could travel up for just a week, so I could attend the graduation since I hadn't cancelled my original flight back to my home state yet. At first, TK said she'd think about it, since she was considering talking to the person in charge of the internship if I could start sooner. SO and I weren't too happy with that response, but it wasn't a flat out no, so we took it. 

Fast forward to that evening, I decided to ask again since we needed to buy the plane ticket and didn't want the price to climb any higher. This time, though, she flipped out. She went on and on about how we didn't have *all* the answers to my health issues \(the ones I wasn't going to deal with until I was back from visiting my SO in the original plan\), and how about she spent money to fly me back for a reason, like it was some kind of inconvenience. When I tried to explain that I didn't think a week would matter that much, since it would just be a week without doctor's appointments and I'd already had the flight  back scheduled, she dramatically told me to do ""whatever the fuck you want, I'm too tired to care!"" 

But apparently TK wasn't, because she then decided to say that she wanted to make me an appointment with my brother's psychologist, out of nowhere, because ""all the tests have come back fine, and yet you're apparently still hurting."" An exact quote of her justification: ""Everything with you is always drama. You're so dramatic! I was never as dramatic as you are when I was 21!"" 

SO said that if she needed to drive the 10 hours to get me out of The Keeper's house, she would. Honestly, I'm so thankful for her, but that's not exactly in my cards since I can hardly convince myself to tell TK no when she asks me to do her own damn to do list, like calling her damn car place to schedule her car service. 

TLDR; The keeper won't let me travel away for a week because she flew me home early bc of my health, yet she said I can work an internship and said my health issues were all in my head and wants me to go to a psychologist.

Sorry, I just needed to vent this out somewhere in one go because it's just been eating at me the past few days and I'm pretty much exhausted from the fighting every night. I just want some peace! "

I'm so happy for him mom. It's his dream job, he wanted it so badly. He was so excited for it.

I was worried that the miles between us would make us drift apart, but it's been almost a month so far and we still chat every day. This is a good sign mom. I should be elated. But I still worry.

This boy is insanely smart and hard working. I have little doubt he's going to be offered a full time position at the end of his internship, especially considering he graduates only four months after the internship. It's an extremely reputable and well paying position. I have little doubt he'll take it.

If he takes it, then our friendship ends when he graduates. I'm staying in contact with him now because he'll be back in school in September, but after he graduates and permanently moves away? He'll be out of my reach.

And even if he doesn't get the offer, or he doesn't choose to take it. I'll just be delaying the inevitable. I graduate 8 months after him. If he's in the same city, we'll stay friends until I graduate. We'll have the same friend group so it won't be hard. But after I graduate? After I move on with life?

There's only one way I can stay friends with this boy mom, and I don't think he wants that. "

I like how the major focuses on the business side of tech that's often overlooked. I can't see myself behind a desk coding everyday, especially since it's something I'm really mediocre at. While I did okay in my CS classes, I struggled a lot to grasp what I was being taught. I made the switch to TIM because a lot of the lower div classes crossed over.

Currently we are using Sinatra and a custom framework that one colleague did for the API in the backend, but lately I've been fiddling with different frameworks or options to build sideprojects.

So far I've messed a bit with Hanami and Sinatra. I really love how ""light"" they feel and how the code is plain Ruby for the most part of it.

I did mention the possibility of wanting to change offices to my coach during the internship, and he said it's not a given but to go for it. And I have asked my recruiter to talk about the process (didn't flat out ask to move), but she basically cold-shouldered me.

I've done a bit of research, and it seems it's not easy to transfer offices, and that the best I can hope for is to tough it through a busy season and stick around for a year, get good performance reviews, then hope the SF or Oakland office needs people.

Obviously, I'd rather not do that, we've already had to be long distance for longer than I'd like. But I'm not delusional if there's no other possibility.

We're visiting because husband has about a 3\-week break between the semester ending and his summer internship starting. And now I'm here to vent to you lovely folks cause OH MY GOD Y'ALL.

First, Saccharinda's house. Let me set the scene. A small ranch at the end of a dead\-end street, not maintained especially well or updated since the 70s. Inside, basically a haunted house. Ceiling lights burn out and she never replaces the bulbs. Cobwebs and bug corpses in corners and behind furniture, although things in immediate view are usually clean. Paint peeling off the kitchen cabinets. Oven full of charcoaly bits that set off the fire alarm when you use it. Also, she has the most random, mismatched, half\-broken assortment of kitchen utensils, dishes, and appliances that I have ever seen. I'd never shame someone for genuinely not having the money to buy new stuff, but she has the money and still won't do it. Her toaster oven is coated in a thick coat of black grease. Most of her furniture is a random mismatched assortment, also not something I'd judge, but also a lot of it is broken or damaged to the point of barely being usable.  She covers everything with cheap dollar\-store butterfly and angel figurines and puts up sentimental Thomas Kinkade\-type art everywhere. Also there are vases of dried flowers on every surface. I feel like I'm on the island of lost tacky floral crap. Her house is very very dark, which is partly due to it being surrounded by trees but also due to her curtain and blind setup, which makes it feel like a cave in here. No wonder both my youngest brothers\-in\-law suffered from depression despite living in a sunny state.

There has been some kind of drama every day that we have been here, and we have been here for about 5 days now. Some of it doesn't translate well into an anecdote as it was mostly just Saccharinda being weird and rambling and emotional, including a long rant that mostly went, ""I will never be a burden to my children, I will kill myself if that ever happens, they need me, I will always keep my home open to them, I will die before I meet my grandchildren \(which she doesn't have yet\), or I will meet my grandchildren and I will teach them to read and paint and explore \(what?\), etc etc.""

But last night was the worst.

My husband went fishing and caught a few nice fish, so I was cooking them up for dinner. Because apparently the oven has never been cleaned, the stuff on the bottom smoked a bit and set off the fire alarm. She came into the kitchen and immediately starting trying to take over. Why was I cooking the fish in parchment paper, parchment paper isn't supposed to go in the oven??!! \(sidebar: it is.\) Why was I doing this or that, I have to do it this way. She continued fluttering and clucking until my husband came into the kitchen and shooed her away. We finished cooking the fish, ate \(it was delicious\) and cleaned up, but not without her popping in and out to bitch at us for leaving the door open \(to let the smoke out\), to ramble aimlessly about her old house and old appliances, and to try to climb a chair to get a tupperware down and almost falling even though my husband offered to help her, and then getting offended when he pointed out that she had obviously been drinking.

She doesn't own that house. It's literally falling apart around her, because her landlord is a super old man who doesn't keep up with maintenance. She could easily move to a condo, but won't because ""her children must always have a home with her."" She refuses to leave this 5\-bedroom house even though it's falling apart because she thinks \(or hopes?\) that her children will move back in with her. I just....gah. I can't believe I have to stay here another week and a half."
8l9up8,1,2018-05-22,Looking for advice on choosing my PhD project,tommeetucker,labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/8l9up8/looking_for_advice_on_choosing_my_phd_project/,"Edit: unsure why this is being downvoted. Am I missing something from the sub rules?

So, as above, I'm looking for a bit of advice. I'm currently in my first year of a four year DTP. The DTP is organised into 1 rotation year (two 4-month rotations in different labs), after which you choose one PhD project (3 years). I'm coming towards the end of my 2nd rotation, and am in the really nice, but slightly annoying, position of really liking both of my rotations. 

For a bit of background, my interests are in cancer/cell/molecular biology, and I'm keen to move into biopharma/biotech after my PhD (not interested in further academia - aware that this might change, but that's my goal for now).

The two rotations are as follows:

**1) Using mass spec analysis of a protein pathway (DNA damage response pathway) to find and characterise novel protein-protein interactors.** 

This one is mostly biochemical, which I feel more comfortable with, but also has access to mass spec work which I think could be useful for working in industry. I get on really well with the primary supervisor, but she is a relatively new PI (worked as a post-doc in a very successful lab for 9 years, before transitioning to PI in a different university a couple of years back) and is yet to publish (she has loads of data, so publication is very likely). She has had one PhD student in another country when she was a post-doc. This PhD student was successful, but the system is different in his country (Czech Republic), so I'm slightly hesitant. I'm also aware that things may change rapidly with a new PI, so how things are currently might not be accurate a couple of years down the line. The lab, being a new one, is small - there's just the PI and post-doc currently. I have a good relationship with the post-doc, but he seems fairly inexperienced, as post-docs go. Other people in the shared lab space are supportive, and I got on well with them. However, she has good links with industry and her previous lab, which is a big draw for me currently. I have to do a 3 month internship in an area outside academia, and I talked about this with her. She has contacts in Astrazeneca and a smaller biopharma, which are quite appealing as potential entry points to industry. The secondary supervisor is the mass spec specialist, successful PI etc, but I didn't see him too much during my rotation.

The university itself is slightly less well-regarded than the university of the 2nd rotation, but the project is at a small institute which has a good reputation, albeit with less funding. I quite like the feeling of a smaller, tighter community. Socially speaking, I liked this rotation, but I think I felt more comfortable in my second lab. Speaking of which...

**2) Using super-resolution/advanced microscopy techniques to investigate force-dependent tumour cytoskeletal dynamics.**

My second rotation is more involved with cell biology with a heavy emphasis on biophysics (basically loads of microscopy, which is really cool but I feel slightly more challenged by, particularly the physics side), as well as use of programming (challenging but should be fine). I'm unsure as to how desirable these techniques will be in industry. The primary and secondary supervisors are a physicist and a cell biologist, respectively. They are both very successful in their fields, both publish often in high impact journals, and the biologist in particular is very highly regarded within the department as a PhD supervisor. Also, they're both relatively young (probably late 30s/40s), so are still hungry, which I like. That being said, they're both very busy, so have a more hands-off approach. This isn't a bad thing, I quite liked the freedom and there's plenty of high-quality support in the labs in the form of post-docs (one post-doc is pursuing a project that was quite close to mine [surprise surprise!], but she's potentially leaving after Christmas) and other PhD students. I've been mainly based in the secondary's lab, and there's 5 or 6 other PhD students. This gives a really nice social setting, and I feel more comfortable socially in this lab. However, I do feel like there's a slight risk of me being 'forgotten' somewhat.

I've got a meeting this week with the two supervisors and the potentially-leaving post-doc, where I'm going to ask about future directions of the project, potential, but also whether the post-doc might extend her contract, and what kind of industry contacts they have. I think I'll be honest with them and say how I'm feeling conflicted between the two projects, so need convincing. Any tips on what else to ask about would be handy!

As I said before, the uni is really well funded, highly regarded, good support network, so I've got no problems there.

That's about it. So I guess what I really want to know is (or the TL;DR):

1) Should I take a chance with a young, but relatively unproven PI, because of industry contacts? Or should I stick with busier, but well-regarded supervisors? I'm trying to not think about it personally and be selfish, but am finding it a bit difficult, as I honestly want the supervisor from the first rotation to succeed.

2) Will the skill sets I gain from rotation 1 better position me for biotech/pharma work in industry than those skills I gain from rotation 2?

Last year I graduated High School and attempted to get my instrument rating over the summer before I started college. I got within a few weeks of the check ride before I had to leave. I couldn’t work on it at school, as it was too much of a hassle to get over to the airport.

This summer, I’m working an internship and am not available on any weekday, but weekends are completely free. I have all of the required hours and have passed the written. I still feel comfortable with approaches, cross countries, unusual attitudes, and overall instrument flying. I’m a little shaky on the book stuff, but it shouldn’t be a problem studying that. 

My questions are the following: will I be able to finish the rating by the end of the summer if I fly every weekend (2 hours sessions, maybe both Saturday and Sunday, up until mid-August)? And how much skill do you think I’ve lost (only flown twice since last August)?

I want to complete the rating, but don’t want to run out of time again. Thanks!!!"

A couple moved in next door to me a few weeks ago. I’m staying in my parents friends house, they decided to move overseas for a sabbatical year, and had generously offered me their home, on condition I looked after it. They were both professors at the college I was going to, do it worked out. They got someone to watch the house, and I got to live privately right off campus.

Back to the couple. He looked to be around 55. A handsome gentleman, looked like he worked in banking, power suit and a silver head of hair. She, on the other hand, looked to be around 40. Blonde, with a perfect hourglass figure, she was the type of woman any young man would give their left hand to have as a neighbor. I say left hand, because they would want the right hand if you know what I mean.

I didn’t have much to do with them the first week, beyond going over to welcome them and introduce myself. The husband seemed nice enough, if not a little preoccupied, and the wife was very bubbly and sweet. I did notice that she was in fantastic shape for her age, but I did catch a glimpse of a private gym in the house so that accounted for her body.

I left them my number with the offer to call if they needed anything, and I didn’t hear from them for two weeks. One morning, on a Sunday, she called me up to ask me to help set up her wifi. She explained that her husband was at work, being a workaholic, and I was happy to help. That was when I first realized she was a bit dim. The only problem with the WiFi was it was unplugged, but she didn’t seem to understand that. She also had me fix a faucet, which was only not working because she was trying to turn the knob the wrong way.

Oh, and did I mention what she was wearing when I got there?. I was happy to help, and quickly did what she needed, before chatting for a few minutes. I didn’t really pay attention, for obvious reasons. But as she droned on, and I eagerly watched and waited for her tits to slip out, I did hear a bit. She mentioned how her husband didn’t let her go to his office anymore, because she would always end up talking to the interns, and once she even let them slap her ass, but just to prove it was real. She explained how at first her husband was upset, but he wasn’t angry after she told him she did it to prove to the interns that their boss had a real wife, not a plastic one.

After we finished chatting, I went back home, but my mind was filled with ideas.

end of scene

So, if it’s not abundantly clear from the setting, I’m looking for a woman who wants to play a bimbo. Not a cock hungry whore, but rather a really sweet, innocent, and gullible woman. I’ll be the young neighbor who slowly starts to take advantage of her, first in small ways, like convincing her to model her bikinis for me, or even lingerie. But we’ll slowly take it further and further, maybe even involving her husband. Perhaps they are trying to conceive, and I explain that I know the best position to impregnate a woman, but I have to demonstrate it on her.

I think you get it. My kinks are bimbos, big tits, outfits, naive women, oily sex, public sex, exhibition, anal, eating pussy/ass, cheating, cuckolding, and much much more

Just need some help navigating this.",mirandastaceygirl,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8lchla/changing_household_situation_getting_more_income/,"Hi personal finance! My household is experiencing lots of changes and I need help sorting out how to plan for the purchase of a new-to-us car within the next year or two. Apologies for formatting in advance I’m on mobile.
My financial picture:

I currently owe about 7.5k on a used car I purchased at a 10% interest rate. 
I have about 1k balance on Amazon credit card (recently paid off about 2k credit card stupidity with Wells Fargo and Ashley’s Furniture)

Have about 11k in Subsidized and Unsubsidized student loans, auto-paying $25 monthly (they’re still deferred since I have about a year until graduation).

Credit Score is in the mid 700s, SO’s score is in the mid 500’s. We just got him a secured card and paid off his debt in collections.

My income is going up I’m going from about 20 hours a week to an internship at 13/hr., 40 hours a week.
 
My SO recently began working as a Correctional Officer making more money (overtime) than he ever has so I don’t pay rent, car insurance, anything other than my car, credit card, child care and groceries. 

So my monthly expenses are 200 for car payment, 50 for Amazon, and 400/month for the babysitter, I have a little over 
1k in savings. 

We’re wanting to purchase a used SUV when his car dies, he’s upside down on it and he has really bad credit. Right now the plan is to continue paying minimum payment and trading it in when the time comes but I’m unsure how to go from here.

 Do we pay his crap car off? Try to pay off as much of my car as possible, or do we save all my extra income and try to save up enough money to buy SUV outright (unlikely we’d be able to save enough). (We’re looking at cars in the 10-13k range max.) I’m not sure if I’ll be able to finance an SUV on my own and I know his credit score would likely result in straight denial or an atrocious APR.

The place I live has a very small town vibe and with that are some pretty natural benefits, that being almost anywhere you go, people know the business by name. However, when you're dealing with real estate and individuals that work solely on commition, you can have an issue where people assume the worst about a brand (slimey, shady salesmen that just want your money). I'm pretty fresh out of school, having a few months as an intern at a marketing agency under my belt and a couple years in social media for local companies and remote positions, however, I haven't walked in to a position where a business had so negative perception working against them.

To get around that sort of image my initial instincts go towards showing off real estate agents personalities, and humanizing the company by going to local events and involving the brand with the community. I want to make sure more than anything that the brand doesn't look like it's just trying to make a sale. I was thinking this could be a decent start and hopefully a good way to help boost engagement while the brand grows it's reach on social media.

I'm feeling defeated, but have so much passion for this field of work and I know it's my calling. My resume is solid and my experience is competitive... but I've never had a full-time position before, I've been a 3 different smaller jobs kind of girl until now - I'd love anyone's thoughts who would like to share!

I graduated in May of 2017 with my Masters in Marriage &amp; Family Therapy and worked at my former internship site until the temporary position ended in Oct. I'm working toward licensure, and have been looking for a full-time therapy position since last October. 

I spent months applying to agencies and non-profits all over town, most were looking for someone who was already licensed or with A&amp;D experience, so most of my applications went unanswered. (I'm talking like - I probably applied to 60 places or more - and maybe 5 places even replied or offered an interview. I know this is just the grind, but it's been pretty demoralizing) 

I was FINALLY hired in April as a full-time youth counselor at a level 3 detention center, and I was over the moon excited. I love working with at-risk youth &amp; their families. I couldn't have been more ready to dig in &amp; work with these kids. 

WELL: I have had issues with oversleeping and turning my alarm off in my sleep, basically my whole life. Early mornings are not my friend, and I've overslept millions of times in my life. If I had it my way, a regular work day would start at 10am - but I thought with a good sleep schedule and some time, I'd get the hang of it? I was diagnosed with DSPD (Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, a circadian rhythm issue, you can read more here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder) in March of last year, and since have just been trying to figure out how to cope, what this means for a full time position, who I should tell, and who really needs to know, etc. It's been scary and overwhelming) 

All that to say - I overslept 2 times during my new position's orientation. One day I was 20 min late and apologized PROFUSELY, but my supervisor seemed to let it slide and told me not to beat myself up about it. 1.5 weeks later, I overslept by 2 hours. 

They *let me go* that afternoon. I did not tell them about my diagnosis up front because I truly thought I had it under control, but they made it clear they would have liked to know in the interview - but I am not convinced I'd get hired if I do disclose? It didn't feel right to start off on that foot, but maybe I should have? I am simply devastated and embarrassed. I have so much in me, and so much passion - I'm trained, ready and KNOW I am beyond capable - but if I can't get there on time, I am a huge liability. I understand that. I'm scared it's going to ruin the 5 years of HARD work I've put in. My heart is broken. 


TLDR : I have trouble with early schedules. I have a newly diagnosed sleep disorder. I was just let go from a full-time position it took me months to get. I'm not sure when to disclose to employers, and when to keep it to myself? I am treating it, but there is no cure and good ""sleep hygiene"" + melatonin is about all I can do. People don't understand, and it makes me look HIGHLY unprofessional, but I am not. It's only the mornings that are difficult. I don't know where this leaves me.


**Sorry this is so long, thank you to anyone who read the whole thing. I'd love any thoughts anyone has before I speak with my supervisor or other professionals I know - I'm simply too raw right now to keep my composure in person, but I still intend to keep moving forward! "

For several years, I have been misdiagnosed as many of you can relate.

BACK STORY: In high school, my pain, lack of movement, and rehabilitation time in sports was told to be related to scoliosis. From there, I did years of physical therapy along with sports and learned several back/hip strengthening exercises that have helped me to this day. I was also given something that is known as the Twin Stem that I believe has helped my undiagnosed fibromyalgia if I catch it before my pain gets to the point I don’t want to be touched. 
After high school, I worked manual labor jobs to pay for a car, and save for college. During this time, work tasks were becoming unbearable.. driving home from 12 hour shifts, my hands would be so swollen I could barely grip the steering wheel; in most cases having to drive home with mostly my knees. I would find temporary relief in hot baths, and on my one day off a week I was bedridden. By 21, Swelling in my lower back, hips, down to my ankles was normal and figured it was associated with my scoliosis as well as work-related. I started losing feeling in my hands and would not be able to grip simple things like pens, open doors, turn on my tub faucet, or tie my shoes. I would consistently drop things without warning my hands were about to “stop working.” Eventually I realized this type of life was not how things should be, and decided to visit my PCP. He diagnosed me with RA but I was skeptical to rely solely on one doctors advice so I asked him to refer me to a Rheumatologist. Blood work was negative for RA, but was positive for HLA-B27. For the meantime, he started me on Meloxicam 15mg as needed because I was taking Goody powders to get through my work days like a crack addict. Because the NSAID did nothing, I was given an MRI and was officially diagnosed with AS. He found widening of both sacroiliac joints as well as fluid being present, a subchondral cyst and erosion in the sacral right joint, and edema present posteriorly in the iliac left joint.

SINCE THE DIAGNOSIS: I have been on 40mg/Humira once every two weeks for four months while still taking the meloxicam as needed. I moved to pursue higher education in NC, have gotten married, and in school full time. I recently had to quit my part time job as a bartender because my flare ups were getting so bad my husband was having to carry me up the stairs to our apartment because I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t drive because of my hands, and he had to declothe and bathe me which has been humiliating. Even walking around my uni’s large campus poses great difficulty for me. I have a follow up appointment on the 30th as the medication has still had no effect on my pain, swelling, or stiffness, and I just really want my life back.. My husband would prefer me home where he knows I’m not in as much pain, but I can’t stand not being busy. I want to work, I want to hike, I want to be able to do everything a 23 year old should be able to do without feeling so confined by my disease. 

FAST FOWARD TO CURRENT ISSUE: Past dental work my husband has had resulted in him being prescribed a months supply of 7.5mg oxycodone. My husband has a weak stomach with strong medication and prefers “toughing it out” so to speak (he’s such a chad 😂) so chose to use only a handful. Since that time during my really bad flares, I have taken one and been able to go about my day as normal; pain free, without having to be bed ridden from what I deem as “normal” activities. My issue is, I have considered bringing pain management up to my rheumatologist because I’m going to need to do my internship soon and has so far been my only breakthrough. BUT, North Carolina is very strict and has been on the whole opiate epidemic kick and I’m afraid he will drop me as a patient thinking I’m simply drug seeking especially because of my age. 

So, I’m really hoping I can get some advice on my next move for treatment through you guys here and maybe hear some of your past experiences with approaching pain management.."

So i recently interned at quite a prestigious company in my country. There were about 20 other interns, most of which were very extroverted and social. Luckily there 1 or 2 other interns that were on the more introverted side and I made friends and hung out with them during the numerous social events organised by the company.


I'm in my last year of university now and i've been offered a graduate role by this company for next year. The company itself is great. It's very high pay, great place to learn and a lot of talent. Problem is I don't know if i can handle all this social pressure and continuously being around highly extroverted people that I feel so different from. The two people that I was kinda friends with during the internship aren't going to be coming back next year which makes it so much more difficult. 


During the internship I avoided all the non-compulsory events e.g. lunches, drinks after work etc. The one time I had lunch with a bunch of other interns I felt completely out of place and ended up just sitting there saying nothing. There are however a lot of these events as part of the program which are compulsory. I'm fine in one to one conversations but being in large groups with highly socially competent people just leaves me lifeless. 


It's gotten to the point where i'm considering not taking the offer despite that being a horrible career decision. I just can't see myself surviving in that environment. I'm really unsure on what to do and would appreciate any advice.

Happy, but confused. Happy that you wanted to talk to me, but confused about the motive.

That was the start of everything. We began texting every day, every night, and no one knew. I confessed that I liked you a week after we started talking, using some stupid analogy in hopes that you wouldn't notice what I said. You were my first for everything \- my first love, my first kiss, and everything that follows. I hated high school until I got with you. I did well academically but never felt complete until I got with you. You completed me. You made me love coming to school and made me love you. I'm sorry for being so insecure, not trusting you, and everything that followed.

I knew you cared about me, loved me, and wanted the best for me. I knew you didn't want me to join a fraternity in college because of everything associated with it. I assured you I wouldn't. But you kept thinking I was going to, and broke up with me because you couldn't deal with me joining an organization founded on principles you hated. We broke up two months before we went to different colleges.

College happened. I pledged a fraternity, and spent most of my time either studying or partying. I became the person you wished I never did, I've hooked up countless times with countless girls, have consumed insane amounts of alcohol, and have done a lot of regrettable things. Sure, I'm doing well academically. I'm currently sitting in the internship that I used to tell you was my dream, I'm on dean's list.... But I still feel like a part of me is missing. I became the person you didn't want me to, but I did that hoping to forget about you.

You turned into the person I never wanted you to become. You started going to raves every weekend, doing drugs, and drinking a lot. It hurts. Its like we both became the person neither of us wanted the other to become. It hurts. But maybe that's just how the cookie crumbles.

I have a new girlfriend now. She makes me happy \- really happy. She told me she loved me a few weeks ago, and I said the same thing since I genuinely felt that way. But it just feels so weird. I never imagined myself being with anyone but you, you were my first love. A part of me still loves you, but it hurts. I know we'll most likely never see each other again as I moved for this summer internship, and I'm shooting for the East Coast while you want to stay in the West. But I wish I could see you one last time.

I love you, K. But I need to forget about you, but I know that is never going to happen."

Next week I'm starting a summer internship in Palo Alto and I really hope to fullfil a lifelong dream of watching an NBA game! It's been 30 years dreaming of this moment, please basketball gods let me have this!

Now, I know the finals aren't a lock yet but I do have to prepare myself.

- Where should I buy tickets? Which websites are the best?

- I've been browsing and I saw on SeatGeek (is it trustworthy?) that one can buy tickets for finals right now. How does this work? Should I take advantage of this, or should I wait for later?

- Any overall recommendations for my first NBA game? Coming from Palo Alto, what is the best way to get to the Oracle Arena (no car)?

Last, if this dream comes true my SO doesn't want to come with me since the tickets are so expensive. Any of you guys want to tag along and buy seats next to each other? I really don't feel like watching this alone.


Thanks in advance!

I'm almost done with school \(yay me!\) and will be taking the VTNE this summer.

I was wondering what advice you guys might have for when I finally make the transition from classroom to the actual field. This summer I will be doing a full\-time internship at fairly busy non\-emergency animal hospital and from there hopefully finding a job at the same place or a similar one.

Vet tech school has been an incredible experience and I'm in disbelief of how much I've learned over the past two years. However, I'm still very nervous about actually *working* as a tech, since I've had next to no actual work experience in animal medicine.

I've had stressful jobs in the past \(currently working at a Starbucks in New York City\) and I know that with time I can be a great tech. However, I expect that the breaking\-in period before that happens is going to be very trying and brutal, and would appreciate any tips you guys have that might make it go more smoothly.

Thanks!"

For most of my life I have been completely consumed with earning as much money as possible, hence why I focused my path towards high finance. However I recently got into a major accident and it caused me to reevaluate what I wanted out of life. 

I’ve always had a passion for understanding the human mind and have begun to think that I would be interested in attending a graduate program for neuroscience. Unfortunately I do not have any real background in the subject, other than my own personal studying. 

I currently have a GPA of a 3.8 and have had top business internships including some at large banks e.g (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley). Would any of that be relevant in an application?

I wanted to know if it would be possible for me to be admitted into a grad program, whether that requires a Masters first before attempting a PhD. I understand that I would be behind most other applicants, but I am more than willing to put in the work to catch up even if that would require staying in school an extra semester or two to add a full Mathematics major. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you!

I am so completely fed up. 

Ive said this many times, I know. But DAMN. The tantrums can come on so sudden.

So the bitch ordered a pair of flats for me. I have a little internship in the fall so I need some dress shoes to wear, and she found a decent deal, showed me what they looked like and ordered them. 

We got them today, I opened the box and looked at them and just nicely said ""Hmmm...I dont know if they'll fit"". I guess red flag #1, shouldnt of said that.

I got them out, put my foot in them and sure enough, no, they did not fit. Too big. Then she was like well you need your (footie thingies) to wear them with so go get those. Put those on, and, same thing. I was stepping out of them.

I boxed the one shoe back up while asking her if she gets the shipping she paid for back (along with the price of the shoe) and she didnt answer. Instead, she *took what I said about them NOT fitting and made it sound like I didn't like them*.

Then, she said what if we try the heel things that people put in the back of the shoe. I got a better idea and went to my flat sneakers and got my insoles out and put them in these shoes.

And ta da, they fit! Not the best fitting, but I can walk 85% in them at least. They are much tighter and my feet do not come up and out of the shoe. 

I told her this, and she got SO upset. Then saying ""if they dont fit we take them back"", during the 3 times I fucking told her THEY DO, AND ITS FINE NOW. I raised my voice slightly and im not proud of it but god its like a toddler. I really have a hard time controlling my frustrations with her when she just keeps repeating herself over and over and looks at me like im Satan himself. 

Then, cue the ""I dont call her anything"" (Mom). Or a ""someone asked me what you call me"" and I scoff-laughed and said ""oh who?"" And she didnt answer. Because she was getting like this I now ended up in the bathroom with the door locked, and she screamed from the laundry room: I have done EVERYTHING for you. And you dont appreciate it ONE BIT. You never thanked me for your medicine (she had the obligation to do it, I was a minor), you never TALK to me what YOUR plans are, and GOD FORBID I END UP ALL ALONE AND BY MYSELF.

Then, she got pissed I wasnt coming out of the bathroom so she came to the door and said ""(cousin) ASKED ME WHAT YOU CALL ME."" Said cousin we will see in 2 weeks and I have opened up to her about her having BPD. I have no idea if this is true or not but I really want to ask. Just not sure if I should wait till I see her in person lol. 

ANYWAY, still in the bathroom, just chilling. 

But why my life. Why is this so hard to deal with guys. God. I hate it. I really, really, hate it.

EDIT: so now she came to the door and said she has to go get a job so she wont see me as much. And that SHE'LL MISS ME BUT WHO KNOWS IF I'LL MISS HER. SHE HOPES SO, BUT WHO KNOWS. 

Fuck. My. Life."

We've had a vast amount of problems that we used to handle quite easily but it feels like we're burning out recently and he's still in denial of it.

I know I've been stressed and busier than before ever since I got my internship but I still try to talk to him if I can.

My family's really strict, a typical Asian family who wants a stable guy for their daughter. My problem is, he doesn't make an effort to get my family's approval anymore. He had to drop out of high school because his father died and he had to work full-time but he left his job for a new one that screwed him over. Since then, he's been unemployed. He had plans to sign up for the military and get his GED but I can't see him put in the effort.

Even though I'm tired from work, feeding my pets, and fending for my older brother's food, I still find time to try and talk to him. We have a 12-hour time difference with me being 12 hours ahead of him and I wait for him to wake up even until 3 or 4 am with only 4-5 hours of sleep. Unfortunately, he's always asleep 80% of the time and he claims he has other responsibilities too, which are only making calls, sending out online job applications, and making his own food. 

We also have this routine where he wakes me up in the morning and usually watches me in the nighttime because I tend to have night terrors and panic attacks in the middle of the night but he doesn't really seem to make an effort anymore.

We don't celebrate anniversaries anymore, we barely talk, and when we do it's only 2-4 hours with 80% of it being him playing on his PS4 and just saying yeah while I try to get his attention. 

He wasn't like this before. He used to surprise me with poems during anniversaries or holidays and he used to even read novels to me just to help me sleep better in times I have my attacks. He was pretty much the best boyfriend a girl could ever have during the first half of our relationship. He only became like this since he got screwed over at his job. He's also been keeping to himself more even when I keep telling him I'm willing to be there and listen to him. It feels like I'm being rejected and neglected.

I also recently have an earache that's been keeping me from sleeping and all he says is ""just go to sleep. I'm here."" again and again with a very annoyed tone. He has also been passing out on me and he's only ever awake for 6-8 hours maximum every day.

I just can't see him making as much effort as he used to before. I keep bringing this to his attention and he always says he'll work on it but he only changes for the first few days and then it's back to the usual. 

With every fight we have over these issues (which I admit can be pretty stupid) I feel that he's more and more distant. He's definitely not cheating on me but it feels like he's not even my best friend anymore either. It feels like he's become an entirety different person. I don't know how to fix this relationship if it can still be fixed. He claims that I'm overreacting and that we're just fine but I feel like he's not 'there' anymore in our relationship.

Any advice?"

I met my Nex in the healing stages a after a rough breakup but mutual breakup. She was beautiful and reminded me of a tiny blond anime character. She was 4'9"", &lt;100lb, had dark winged eyeliner, and an eye like a galaxy. The kind of girl I would have normally thought to be way out of my league. I added her on fb because I thought she was cute and one day decided to hit on her at the the local weekly electronic show after some liquid courage. We hit it off and went back to where she was staying for a Harry Potter ""marathon"" that only lasted one movie. We almost dated but I decided that I wasn't ready for a relationship and it didn't feel right and frankly, she wasn't perfect. She was disabled (blind in one eye and poor vision in the other, severe type 1 diabetes, gastrointestinal issues), didn't have the best reputation among my friends due to a previous relationship, and was kinda boring compared to previous SOs. Things were off and on over the summer, we bonded in many ways, and she seemed to have a strong affection for me still, rarely going long without inviting me over even if just to hang out when things were off. She was extremely accepting and comforting.

At one point, I tried to break it off before it became too serious and because I had met a girl that shared very similar interests where as we shared very few aside from a love for stupid adult cartoons and animals. This was the night the limerence started and she ensnared me. During that conversation, among other things, she made me to look her in the eyes and said ""Would you really walk away from someone who loves you that much?"". My heart simultaneously fluttered and dropped because I knew not only how she felt, but also that the answer to that question was undeniably no. I still avoided her for a while, but she showed up to my first time djing at a show after begging people for rides and was standing there waiting for me when I got off stage. Done deal.

Fast forward 6 months and she's living with me and we are both extremely happy, but she starts getting sicker more often. Regular serious hospitalizations due to kidney infections, home health care visits, and even a month or more long coma. I stood by her through all of it. I've carried her up the stairs when she was having seizures, given her iv medications, saved her from near-fatal blood sugar spikes, and thought she was going to die several times, only serving to severely deepen my attachment to her and incorporate childhood traumas from my father and other family members hospitalizations and deaths.

A little over a year in the health problems continue, Im still super happy and im contemplating popping the question to her. I pull away from my friends to focus on spending more time with her and start working a difficult full-time job to support us while we continue living in a section of my mom's place, as she only gets 400 dollars a month in disability and the rent is excellent. 4 to months or so later, after the coma and me telling her I'm going to step up even more than I already had with her health, she became restless and our lives stagnated, she was very conscious of the fact she couldn't work, she slowly shut down and stopped communication and I tried desperately to get her to open up to me more.

2 years in, she had started getting deeper into her hobby, reptile husbandry, and had met a lot of people through Facebook, making no real effort to introduce them to me. She drops right before Thanksgiving That she is going to go to Wisconsin for 4 months for an ""internship"" to learn how to breed reptiles professionally. I had been extremely stressed out by the holiday season at work. I was not happy. It made no sense with her health, and the idea of it made me physically ill, but we agreed that she could go up to check it out for a week instead of just going straight up there. During this time, I come to find out this guy is single, something I had been told the opposite of. This caused a fight, for me to throw accusations, and when she came home, she would barely even look at me.

She moved out 5 days before Christmas with only a day or two's notice after weeks of bargaining with her that turned into arguing after I saw a suspicious text message pop up on her phone while we were watching a video that confirmed her and this person had some sort of emotional relationship between them, and an eventual tearful agreement that she wouldn't go. She said she was moving into her moms for a bit and was just going to come get some clothes. She showed up with a full-sized U-Haul and 3 people instead. I haven't seen her since. Through all of this, even after moving out,  she was saying she doesn't want to lose me and she isn't breaking up with me. I come to find out later she had pretty much moved straight into that guy's place afterward although part of me really doubts she just hopped into a relationship with him. This could be extremely wrong though.

Now Here I am, 5 months later. I haven't heard her voice since a couple weeks after, and haven't received a text since February. You could write a book out of the unanswered questions. My anxiety has gotten so bad that I had to get on medication and that seems to be losing its effectiveness anymore. The thoughts about her haven't stopped. I dream about her, fantasize about her, I worry about her. She pops into my head thousands upon thousands of times every day. It has affected my life and my friendships. Close friends are sick of hearing about it. Shes on my mind so much, that I end up talking about her when that's the last thing I should do. It's like I'm stagnating in my thoughts and what-ifs and cant move forward with my life. I can't stop them. I legitimately don't know how to deal with it anymore and everyone just keeps telling me to pick myself up and brush myself off. I'm still in the same place. I just at a loss. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been reading up on covert narcissism after someone said she had similarities to the condition. She does. Almost every one of them. A sense of being special and not receiving what she is owed, grandiose ideas about what type of dream future she deserves, non reciprocation, preoccupation with others opinion of her, trying to play the victim in every situation, talking to others about me behind my back, projecting her own issues on others, and gaslighting and silent treatments during any confrontation between us were a regular occurrence toward the end. I'm still consumed with thinking about her though after realizing all this.

TL;DR How the hell do I get out of this hole and stop letting this ruin my life?? Please help me make better sense of this situation. I'm so lost.

So in a move not a million miles away from what Mark Waid did to Zack of Comics an Diversity and trying to harm his business not to be outdone ex Gawker property Deadspin has decided to go one step further and actually published a piece attacking rival publication Barstool Sports.

Here's some exerts (don't worry NO PERSONAL INFO)

&gt; Perhaps more importantly, though, the real value of PFT Commenter’s shtick imitating a dog-whistling, sexist, message-board idiot is tricking people—or at least certain people, whose opinions matter very much—into thinking that Barstool Sports is not in fact dominated by racist, neanderthal bullies who harass women online, videotape each other in the shower, and call underage girls hot, repeatedly, but is in fact some high-concept gag.

&gt; Well, mostly; Barstool’s reputation still managed to ruin PFT Commenter’s deal for an ESPN show after the network decided it should distance itself from Barstool personalities, which have trafficked in racist stereotypes, joked about fucking one of their interns, joked about rape, and wondered whether it was okay for Harvey Weinstein to leverage his power for sex.

Here's a nice part where it names a load of people (they're Public figures) to help point out who the twitter mobs should go after to try and damage the rival company and pressure to distance themselves from Barstool Sports

Here's some more

&gt; Neither the Post profile nor any of the others, though, pay any sort of attention to how PFT Commenter allows Barstool to launder its worst instincts through the character’s ironic detachment, nor do they even try to grapple with......how the PFT Commenter character—carefully curated over years to strike the pitch-perfect impression of an ignorant, macho, entitled white guy—is actually an apt front for exactly the stereotypes it supposedly mocks. 

&gt; As for the other stuff—what exactly does he find hilarious about the president of his company harassing me for months on end? Did [name removed] think it was funny when his boss said, about me, “I want to fucking take her out to Valentine’s Day and stick my tongue down her throat”?

&gt; PFT Commenter never spoke up once about the racism or the misogyny of the company he works for, and why would he? He’s a character; he’s not real. [real name] is, though

Now I'm no legal expert but I'd say it was pretty legally iffy to publicly release some-ones name, put out calls for them to somehow speak out or shame them for not speaking out and name other professional people associating with Barstool sports while claiming the other publication is racist and sexist.

**Just to finish off**

I'm not some-one who pays really any attention to Barstool sports, my only real experience was watching on twitter as some people from Barstool sports documented and pointed out the ridiculousness of the post superbowl riots / insane out of control celebrations.

Oh and this also looks like some very sour grapes on the part of Deadspin possibly in retaliation for some-one on the [Barstool Sports subreddit pointing out how a Deadspin writer who accused another of sexual harassment found herself fired](http://archive.fo/vRoKV) and any-one commenting about it on Deadspin was being banned"

Quality - 8/10. Smells like leather I think? Slight factory smell, but I also have an extremely sensitive nose so take that with a grain of salt. A little stiff. A little bit of a weird texture. Hoping it will break in.  I feel like it’s ever so slightly off center but don’t know if it’s my eye tricking me. Strap quality could be improved, feels a little stiff, not supple. Hoping it will break in with time. 

Accuracy: 8/10. Pretty similar to what everyone else has been saying on here. Tab is too long. The imprinting is not quite matching the authentic interns of “puffiness”, I am hoping that with wear and lots of leather conditioner that it will soften up. The engraving on the lock is slightly off, as is the hardware color. The stamping on the handle is slightly off, but not that noticeable given the color of the bag. Luckily, there is no engraving on the strap belt buckle, as that is what I was worried about when I didn’t get any pictures of that from the seller.  I don’t know if my ability to judge this bag for early is being clouded by my negative experience with the seller, and if I’m being overly harsh. I do plan to keep and wear this bag as I’m not in a position to be called out by anyone close to me. 

Communication - 1/10. Only because she offered me a discount on my next purchase and is trying to correct her lie/mistake, but I will never buy from her again and I think that this is a pretty crappy way to correct a huge misstep.  I specifically requested PSPs no fewer than 3 separate occasions in our chat, And yet she sent the bag without PSPs. To me, that undermines her integrity as a seller, as well as removes any ability for me to put trust in her. I would not recommend this seller.  Additionally, while she was very quick to immediately respond to me with all things regarding payment, She did not hold up to her timelines afterwards.  After I received the bag and told her I was disappointed with the tab length, she didn’t really acknowledge it.  Certain sellers are Known not to send PSP’s but they also have been on the trusted seller list for so long and have so many reviews. I stupidly went with a new seller thinking she would stick to her word that PSPs would be sent  before shipping, And I was wrong"

8lfwc0,0,2018-05-22,I Just Ruined My Career,PhotonParable,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/8lfwc0/i_just_ruined_my_career/,"Just to preface this, what I write is probably going to sound extremely stupid and stuck-up, but I need to put this somewhere.

So, I go to a well known tech school, and am in one of the harder engineering majors. Around here, sophomore year spring is notoriously hard. Everyone on campus agrees that people my year during sophomore year suffer a lot. Not much sleep getting group projects done, borderline unfair exams, highest suicide rate among graduate students. We call our 30-person class of 2020 in this major ""one big family"" mostly because we have to Mom over each other and check in to make sure people have enough sleep/caffeine and have eaten in the past day.  I've actually passed out in the middle of a 4-hour lab session because of back-to back exams not giving me time to eat enough.
After school, I plan to go into a field that 

A) recruits VERY early for internships. Most hiring for summer 2019 is already done, and if you don't have a summer internship that you can get a full-time offer from, getting into the industry is basically trying to win NASCAR with a Ford Fiesta. 

B) has a high GPA cutoff. 19/20 firms will automatically reject you via computer algorithm if your GPA isn't 4.5 out of 5. 

It seems like all my plans have gone to shit, because I've just gotten my first C in a class, cementing my GPA below 4.5. And given the timing of recruitment (ends in just a couple weeks), I have 0 opportunity to fix it, as junior year grades won't be considered for anything. 

I know this sounds stupid and abstract and extremely unrelatable, but I don't have many friends on campus and anyone I could tell this to would look at me like some elitist asshole. I know people have it worse but in my own mind it feeeels like everything has gone wrong at once..."

8lgacn,5,2018-05-22,Do you ever question if graphic design was the right choice for you? anyone else experiencing extreme Disappointment with how hard it is to find a job in this field?,SpicyGreasyBalls,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/8lgacn/do_you_ever_question_if_graphic_design_was_the/,"Ok a little backstory, because I feel the need to vent my problems on a greater level than my aggravation with coding.

&amp;nbsp;

11 years ago I graduated with a bachelors in Media Arts and Animation, wasn't a prodigy of any sort at drawing... and was having an impossible time finding work. I later decided maybe graphic design would be easier and have much more demand, so I got an associates in Visual Communication, at a college that was teaching it for the first year ever and didn't seem to know what to teach or the proper way to. But, when time came to get a job, most jobs I saw required coding.... and I could never really code much of anything no matter how hard I try to teach myself through tutorials, and in college they did a shit job of trying to teach us coding + java in a matter of a few weeks. I could edit pre existing html slightly, edit some css values if given an example, small stuff like that. And I made my own wordpress site for my portfolio, with a pre-existing template. I mean, I can do other things fairly well, I know Photoshop, Illustrator, and indesign very well, as well as video editing software and some motion graphics. I've had a 1 year internship, few contract jobs, few lower end paying jobs, somewhat worked my way up to working for a place like Groupon on contracts, and currently I've been at an agency job that's consisting only of 3 employees for a small company as a sub-contractor, so my boss told me what hours I get, and over time would lessen my time there after 2 years with him.

&amp;nbsp;

Right now, he's told me it's been slow with work coming in, so I haven't worked at all for him for 2 weeks. Usually I'm at the office from 10am to 4pm making 25/hr, no benefits. So, being out a few weeks with all different kind of payments to make has made me scared. I only just moved out of my parents house about a year ago, because I thought I could finally live on the money I was making in graphic design, and could find a different job while I was working for this bozo as a subcontractor. For 2 years I was searching for a better job, going to interviews and thinking I did well in them. I've had 3 different classes on interviewing for a job in the past, and I think my online portfolio is pretty decent. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I try to learn coding, I just can't get it, I can't put it to practice. Aside of online tutorials, I even started trying learning apps to help, and while I understand the concepts, I just can't do anything with it and can't remember everything. It's beyond aggravating, and scary. My parents are currently paying for me to see a life coach, though I've already tried everything I can think of. Having gone to 2 different types of art colleges, I don't really want to have all that time have gone to waste and settle for a very low paying job doing something degrading. I'm almost 36, I shouldn't be at this point in my life, and I'm scared.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I've been waiting for a professional tool to just make my life simple when it comes to coding things for design. I know there's some things out there... but often there's many different kinds, and I don't think these companies will allow them. What's The Easiest Yet Most Professional Tool To Create Responsive Websites/Email Templates/ Etc?

8lgodq,18,2018-05-23,My job was the catalyst that made me realize I was in a terrible relationship,pronounverbnoun,NarcissisticAbuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/8lgodq/my_job_was_the_catalyst_that_made_me_realize_i/,"I've been working on writing this out (I love writing, my nex thought it was dumb so I stopped doing it, well that and being in grad school where I write every day haha) but I've been reflecting on it a lot, and I wanted to share.

My nex and I dated for two and a half years. There were some red flags that I ignored...the Bojack Horseman quote ""When you're wearing rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just looked like flags"" shook me. I was completely enamored with my nex, I couldn't believe I was the girl who was able to date him. If you go through my post history, you can see some examples of how he broke me down early on.

Fast forward two years to August of 2017. I just started grad school and have an assistantship working in my campus's interfaith office. At this point, he was terrible. He was going through stuff as well (not that it excuses what he did, but I was using that as an excuse to stay with him) and he just kept getting worse and worse. As part of my job, I had to work with men and campus and community partners and he got insanely jealous. He hated me being happy and thriving in this position. There were times when I would call him after doing a successful program or meeting and he would literally tell me to shut up because he didn't want to hear it.

Fast forward to October: I was meeting with the interns I supervise as well as my supervisor. One of the interns had gotten into a car accident, so the meeting was discussing empathy. My supervisor was describing the importance of having a heart, and caring about others. He said that empathy was about understanding an emotion that someone was feeling, even if you haven't been in that same situation. While we were talking about empathy, I realized my nex had zero empathy - not even sympathy. I went home and did some research, and it came to emotional and mental abuse.

In November and December, my relationships with my colleagues grew. In the interfaith spaces, we were encouraged to be vulnerable and authentic. They did not want us to come, ready to convert others. They wanted us to bring our authentic selves to these spaces and be willing to hear new things. In these spaces, I and my opinions were so deeply cared for and wanted, I was in shock. I haven't felt truly valued in a very, very long time. At first, I felt very awkward and out of place in those spaces, but upon arriving home, I would be in tears because of how comfortable I felt and how cared for I was. They wanted feelings front and center, they wanted respect, and understanding, and love. In those spaces, I was truly loved; that is how I knew what love was. Not in my 2.5 year relationship, but the interfaith spaces. In these spaces, I not only felt the love to me, but saw the love between others. Everyone cares so deeply about each other, and I decided that was the relationship I wanted.

I could never be authentic with my nex, because it was HIM and him only. If problems arose, his feelings only mattered. I was always, always less than, and he would remind me of it. I was always the worst thing to have ever happened to him. He hated hearing my point of view, so I eventually stopped talking. I became less of myself. However, I grew being in the interfaith spaces. I regained my strength of myself, which caused more and more fights - I wanted to stand up for what I was feeling because I knew I had great people backing me.

I hope my relationship with these interfaith spaces last longer than my old relationship. I graduate in one year, and it will be the most heartbreaking thing to leave this community, more heartbreak than I felt breaking up with my nex."

When he came into the show he was shown as being a very competent doctor and I'm glad that they've not changed that but he is also a bit surplus. His relationship with Maggie was fantastic I have no idea why they culled that, beyond that and especially with Cross and the rest of his class in resident-limbo he's a spare part.

The story with Sam was pointless until 'Beautiful Dreamer'. 

He feels too familiar, too experienced and much older than the current interns to be paired with them but is far too young to really be with the attendings. I have a feeling he's going to end up with Dahlia (literally his only option at this point) but I'd love them to introduce a recurring character for him to interact with.

Cross wasn't that awful as an occasional character and they could always use Hannah Brody more often. Giacommo deserves better."

Leader Election Algorithm , not only in distributed systems but in any communication network, is an essential matter for discussion. Tremendous amount of work are happening in the research community on this Election, because many network protocols are in need of a coordinator process for the smooth running of the system. These socalled Leader or Coordinator processes are responsible for the synchronization of the system. If there is no synchronization, then the entire system would become inconsistent which intern makes the system to lose its reliability. Since all the processes need to interact with the leader process, they all must agree upon who the present leader is. Furthermore, if the leader process crashes, the new leader process should take the charge as early as possible. New leader is one among the currently running processes with the highest process id. In this paper we have presented a modified version of ring algorithm. Our work involves substantial modifications of the existing ring election algorithm and the comparison of message complexity with the original algorithm. Simulation results show that our algorithmminimizes the number of messages being exchanged in electing the coordinator..

Election, Coordinator,Message Complexity, Ring Algorithm,Distributed System."

My Motorola Moto X Play is getting pretty slow and unreliable, especially conceirning the battery. It often turns out at 30% or when I want to use the camera.

(Short facts from the ""Help uns help you""-Thing: Germany, 250-350€, circa same size as my moto x play (5,5""), Used for gaming, instagram, etc, camera and co., long living battery would be awesome too!)

So I looked for a new phone the last few weeks and tried to make a choice but am not sure, where I want to spend my money on. (I am not that uptodate what is important for a mobile phone and what is not.) My pre-choice is:

Nokia 6 (2018): Looks overall solid to me. Snapdragon 630, good Camera and Battery. At the moment my Number 1 Choice.

Motorola Moto G6 Plus: I was very happy with my Moto X Play. It also has the same Snapdragon 630 in it. I am not really sure why i should need this dual-cam-stuff.

iPhone SE: Never had an iPhone so far, so far I even fought against it to get one. but it seems to work. I am pretty happy with android, but this really seems like an alternative...(Maybe the wrong subreddit then :D)

Sony Xperia XA2: Also the Snapdragon 630, 3300 mAh...but only 32GB intern storage.

Nokia 7 Plus is a bit out of the price range but if it was worth it i maybe would take it and eat pasta the rest of the month.


I would like to have a good capacity, so 64GB would be great. Now I always have to delete stuff to install new apps, etc... a nice processor for the right speed would be cool too and I don't have a clue what is good there atm. 
Thanks for your suggestions and I hope I can buy a new one until the beginning of the next month :)"

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

Personally, I would have chosen a midnight blue to accent with the dark grey of the rest of the walls, but oh well, this wasn’t my room. Hell, it wasn’t even my house.

*Wait, why the fuck am I focusing on the goddamn wall?* “Hello?!” I call out, waiting for a response that never comes. I sigh. I guess after what feels like hours in the same room even the most mundane things become interesting. Especially if you’re not still there by choice. 

In this case, I certainly am not.

I try to pull my arms up, testing the restraints that bind me to the bed only to discover that yes, I’m still bound, and no, I haven’t magically obtained superhuman strength since last zoning out. 

“Dammit.”       
____________

It feels like an eternity since I first arrived earlier in the day. You had told me you needed help preparing for what you called ‘the party of the year’ and that I was the only one who’d be able to make it happen. How could I resist? I figured that this would be my chance with you after all this time, that you asked me to come help because *obviously* you liked me too but just hadn't admitted it. Why else would I be the *only* one who could help?

I remember when the door first opened you eagerly greeted me with a light kiss on the cheek. The house looked freshly cleaned and the kitchen counter had all sorts of alcohol waiting to be put away, most prominently of which were bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir, along with some bottles of Islay Scotch whiskies, and an assortment of beer. It was easy to see that this was going to be a *very* fun night.

Mentioning vaguely that the thing you needed help with was upstairs, you guided me to the room I now find myself in and asked that I sit on the bed. I obliged. Leaning over, you had kissed me on the cheek once more and said that you actually had a surprise for me, and requested I slide a heavy blindfold over my curious eyes, but only after removing my shirt. My heart began beating faster, my interest was piqued, and I couldn’t refuse due to a sudden release of adrenaline paired with what people call ""thinking with the wrong head.""

You had moved expertly, quickly and quietly in binding my wrists first and then my ankles. I wasn’t quite sure what was going on despite feeling the leather straps tighten against my skin, but how could I have known your intentions were devious?

“What are you doing, huh?” I laughed. “What’s going on? This isn’t the type of surprise I had in mind… wait, seriously, what’re you doing?”

As you adjusted the straps I found myself forced to lie on my back with arms sprawled either direction, securely locked at the wrists. Warm light greeted my eyes when you removed the blindfold, and you paced around the room silently until my protests were exhausted. Due to my panicking I can’t remember exactly what you said, only that you mentioned things about this being a *very* unique, special party, and that you hoped I would be a “good boy” and help the guests with their fun.             
_____________

Once you left, I found myself waiting for what felt like an eternity with no indication of life in the house. . . until now. 

Music begins to fill the downstairs, reverberations from the bass work their way through the floor to subtly shake the bed I’m tied to. Although the door is closed and it’s difficult to hear, at times I can make out what sounds like moans and cries from down the hall. I’m not sure that I want to know what “fun” you mentioned helping with, but as the door to the bedroom finally opens, it seems I’m about to find out. . .     
_____________

Hello! I’m looking to build a (hopefully) long-term RP where my crush manipulates me into being a “central attraction” for a *very* kinky sex party. This includes, primarily, having multiple different women (played by you) enter the room where I’m tied one by one so I can be forced to clean the fresh creampies from their pussies as they sit on my face. The idea is that they’ll be fucking throughout the night with partners of their choosing, and between each one they can elect to have me prepare them for the next. This’ll be slightly humiliating and I’ll be expressing the thoughts, emotions, and conflicts I’m dealing with as I slowly go from hating it to secretly enjoying it. I’m also open to some forced-bi action if that’s your type of thing.

I’d love to explore this with you and create a kinky adventure for us both. Who are you? My college-aged friend who I’ve always crushed on? My older co-worker who I intern for? Have you invited anyone special to the party? Someone from my family? An ex-girlfriend? A rival? There are many ways this can go, and I’m excited to hear your own suggestions/ideas, no matter what they are. So if this interests you, feel free to shoot me one of those dirty orange envelopes, and let’s create one of the dirtiest, kinkiest parties of the year. . ."

My girlfriend is a Chinese national moving to Bangkok for a 6 month internship starting this July. She's looking for some info prior to the move, I would really appreciate if anybody could offer me some advice relating to the following questions:

Accommodation - Her work will be on Rajadamnern Nok Avenue (Bangkok 10200). Could anybody advise nearby districts which are generally inhabited/offer suitable accommodation options for expats? She's studied in the west for years so she'd happily live in any expat community not just Chinese, but if a district exists that is predominantly Chinese-inhabited that would be a bonus. Also, If anybody could point me in the direction of some websites that offer info relating to expat accommodation in this area of Bangkok that would be fantastic.

Health Insurance - Does anybody have any experience of any sites that offer expat health insurance which would allow her to apply for cover for the 6 month period.

Safety - Finally just in relation to safety. As a woman, could anybody give me any indication as to the safety of the respective areas of Bangkok? Particularly at night.

Any help anybody could offer would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks so much in advance.

That being said, I’m considering adding another pup to the family. My boyfriend and I raised Dara last year and she’s been great, albeit she’s a late bloomer and going through her rebellious teenage stage now. 

We’ve noticed that she gets pretty sad when she leaves her dog pals.
This spring, I did an internship in a different town from my college and stayed with a family friend. She owns four Dachshunds and one was a few months older than Dara. They played nonstop and were always together. After my internship ended, I moved back to my college apartment and our dog wasn’t as lively as she was anymore. She slept a lot, she didn’t care for the dog park, but she would play with us. We took her to the vet and she was fine.
We stayed at my boyfriend’s moms house for a week and Dara wouldn’t play with the Mini Schnauzer she has despite the fact that we got our dogs the same time and they always play nonstop. After a day though, she was back to her playful ways. Again, they were together nonstop and when we went back to our city, she became sad again. We do training, go on long walks, and try our hardest to mentally stimulate her but it sometimes doesn’t work. 

The thing is that most of her puppyhood was like this: always on the go, making sure we socialized her to leaving different homes, car rides, and meeting new dogs so this is really perplexing me.

I think Dara does better living with another dog, even if they ignore her (as the three other older Dachshunds did). 

Of course, I accept the fact that maybe a second puppy and her won’t get along and be friends which is fine as I love her company and would like to add another Aussie to our lives.

Sorry for the long story, I thought I’d provide some context! "

8lmi0i,3,2018-05-23,Repeated Ghost Sightings (22M). Advice appreciated.,Trucklar,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8lmi0i/repeated_ghost_sightings_22m_advice_appreciated/,"Hey so to give a bit of background. I'm 22M, UK-based. (Sorry if formatting is bad. I'm typing this on my phone).

I went through a very very bad period, which I won't go into detail but my home life was incredibly turbulent, alongside the normal turbulence of being a teenager and puberty and exams etc etc.

During this turbulence, I lost literally all my confidence (previous to this I was very popular, top of the class and very social), and i cut several toxic family members from my life which resulted in the rest of the family turning their back on me and kicking me out. 

Because of all this I began to really eat my feelings instead of crying or whatever, which resulted in me becoming obese/super obese. After having a good long chat with myself, i began to clean my act up a lot. I went back to sixth form, tried to boost my grades up (was failing at this point). And eventually managed to get some reasonable A level grades. 

Decided I wanted to go to uni, and I still wanted to work on myself, because I was missing the kid I used to be. Started hitting the gym and have now lost a lot of that weight although I'm still a little a way off from a 6 pack (I will get one soon though!). Built a lot of my confidence back up, picked up some hobbies and sports, made new friends etc.

Girls have always been turning my head, but the last 12 months I've been turning quite of few of theirs which has been awesome, because before everybody ignored this elephant in the room.

The issue is, is that a lot of them are literally just disappearing. Like we would meet during an event, party, an internship etc we'd get along fine in a friendly manner, then she would pursue it a little more and I was cool with becoming something a bit more and we'd meet for drinks and start doing dates and getting more intimate and then all of a sudden it would just stop. Like nothing. 

So I figured the first few were flukes and it was down to my lack of understanding relationships and women in general.

But then it happened for the 6th time and I began thinking this is an issue with me. Perhaps I'm moving too fast or something, so with the next girl I slowed it down. Tried to play it cool. Got the same result. Tried slowing it down with the next few girls. Same thing they all just upped and disappeared.

So I slowed it even more to the point where it would come across that I didn't give a damn, I got an exact mirrored response. I wasnt expecting that. 

I changed tactics after that, figured I was meeting the wrong girls, met girls in different places, different cities and literally different countries....somehow managed to replicate the same thing.

I recently started talking to a girl I really really clicked with, we knew each other really well as kids and through some of school until she moved to the other side of the UK. Our unis are in the same city. We started hitting it off and doing really well....it's now been 3 weeks since she ghosted me as well.

None of these girls overlap with each other, I don't talk about previous girls with them,and it's not a 'bad sex' thing because I didn't sleep with many of these girls. 

I just can't for the life of me understand where I'm going wrong. And I desperately want to fix it. Its not normal to be ghosted in the exact same manner by 23 different girls, who are highly unlikely to know each other so I'm assuming the issue lies with me.

I honestly don't know why this is happening, can anyone shed any light on what the fuck I'm doing wrong?"

A little about me currently. I'm 22, in college, and if I'm frugal barely breaking even after my work income \(maybe \~900/m\). I'm taking out loans for college for every penny except that which FAFSA can cover. I'm not *too* too concerned about this as my degree costs about 40k, fafsa gives me the full 5k a year, and I'm a CS major with good grades. What I have in savings is little more than my loan refunds. I had more from before I returned to school but car maintenance and hospital bills have wittled it down and I can't work the hours I need to put money back into savings.

I'm about to start an internship that will have me sitting pretty right compared to what I'm used to \(17/h, full time\). I'm subletting my appartment and they're putting me up in a hotel a mile from work \(so I'm probably going to be biking to save gas\). Aside from that, I could really use some tips on how to 

a. Maximize my savings while I'm working full time agian

b. Minimize my expenses while I'm working full time agian

Any tips would be greatly appreciated "
8ln1i5,2,2018-05-23,[Discussion] Owners of high energy dogs: what’s having two like?,malsary,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/8ln1i5/discussion_owners_of_high_energy_dogs_whats/,"I didn’t think it was true when people said Australian Shepherds are like potato chips... you can’t just have one!

That being said, I’m considering adding another pup to the family. My boyfriend and I raised Dara last year and she’s been great, albeit she’s a late bloomer and going through her rebellious teenage stage now.

We’ve noticed that she gets pretty sad when she leaves her dog pals. This spring, I did an internship in a different town from my college and stayed with a family friend. She owns four Dachshunds and one was a few months older than Dara. They played nonstop and were always together. After my internship ended, I moved back to my college apartment and our dog wasn’t as lively as she was anymore. She slept a lot, she didn’t care for the dog park, but she would play with us. We took her to the vet and she was fine. We stayed at my boyfriend’s moms house for a week and Dara wouldn’t play with the Mini Schnauzer she has despite the fact that we got our dogs the same time and they always play nonstop. After a day though, she was back to her playful ways. Again, they were together nonstop and when we went back to our city, she became sad again. We do training, go on long walks, and try our hardest to mentally stimulate her but it sometimes doesn’t work.

The thing is that most of her puppyhood was like this: always on the go, making sure we socialized her to leaving different homes, car rides, and meeting new dogs so this is really perplexing me.

I think Dara does better living with another dog, even if they ignore her (as the three other older Dachshunds did).

Of course, I accept the fact that maybe a second puppy and her won’t get along and be friends which is fine as I love her company and would like to add another Aussie to our lives.

Sorry for the long story, I thought I’d provide some context!

We live in an apartment with a members only dog park down the street. We often go on hikes and are planning a trip to Acadia National Park just because we can bring a dog! (Tbh I was so jealous of all of the dogs I’d meet on the trails..)"

I'm new to Reddit and this is my first post in this group so I'm not really sure what to say, so I'll just kind of lay it all out there.

I'm in my mid-30's and in a rut. I've had a few different AP's in the past (been married 10 years) but haven't had one for a couple of years now. Coming from a DB; otherwise the marriage itself is fine I guess. It's been a DB pretty much from Day 1 but I learned to accept it as I thought it was normal (as the stereotype goes, once you're married your sex life dies!). All she ever wanted was to be a mommy and once we had two kids she jokingly told a mutual female friend that she ""got what [she] needed"" from me. While I was in the room with them. It was humiliating. On the bright side I later ended up connecting with that same mutual friend, largely because of that comment, and although it never turned physical we had a decent EA going on for a couple of years.

Wife and I are total opposites when it comes to affection. I grew up in a very loving household, both of my parents would hug me and put their arms around me, we'd say we love each other multiple times a day. My wife only hugs her father and it's rare for her to tell any other family members that she loves them. I'm a very physically-affectionate person and she is not. I play with her hair, rub her back, put my hand on her leg, kiss her forehead, smack her butt when I walk past her in the kitchen, etc. None of that is reciprocated. If anyone here is familiar with the Five Love Languages book, we read it together and my Love Language is ""touch"" while hers is ""gift-giving."" And that pretty much sums us up-- she's material, I'm physical. If I have a warm bed to sleep in and food to keep me full and someone to wrap my arms around then that's all I need. Well, and Netflix of course. I need Stranger Things 3 just as badly as anything I'm talking about here.

I've been told pretty much my whole life that I'm a good-looking guy but ever since we got married my self-esteem has plummeted. I've always been lean, but several years ago I started working out like crazy in hopes that being fit would win some affection from her. She admitted that I looked nice but it did not win any more affection. (Un)fortunately it did lead to getting noticed by some other women. As I mentioned I've had a few different AP's over the years, all women from various jobs I've had, and all women I was friends with before it developed into something more. Each affair ended when it became too much for the woman involved who ultimately ended up falling in love or wanting more than what I could give.

I started a new job two years ago and have had no APs or pAPs since. All of my encounters in the past happened naturally as I worked very closely with other young women in smaller companies. Now that I'm in my mid-30's and working for a larger corporation I'm surrounded by either older married women or hot young interns that wouldn't give me the time of day. And my department specifically is made up of mostly men. The icing on the cake is that I'm terrible at reading signals, and almost got into some pretty hot water in the past for misreading the intentions of a coworker who apparently was toying with me for whatever reason. Needless to say, even if there were some pAPs here I'd have no idea how to find them.

I guess all of this is to say that I haven't had any attention for a while and I miss the high of talking and flirting with someone else. I'm stuck in my marriage, stuck in my job (which I otherwise love--there just doesn't seem to be much opportunity here to find someone), and feeling down overall. I stopped working out regularly a year or so ago and that's not doing any favors to my self-esteem either.

Unless, of course, you're a fan of the ""I can tell you used to be muscular but now it's obvious that you sit at a desk all day"" dad bod. Then maybe we can talk.  :)"

# By Kris Felicello @KFelicello

[Kris Felicello](https://i.redd.it/q54mxfbljpz01.jpg)

It is a question I think about often. I have always had a tendency to do things a little differently to break the mold, especially if I feel in my heart it is the right thing to do. Over the years it has led to some of the decisions I am most proud of and some of my most cringe\-worthy moments. With experience I have learned that there is an art to breaking the rules, and art I am still trying to master. I now understand sometimes it is the right thing to do and sometimes it is not.

When is it ok to break the rules? That was a question I posed to prospective kindergarten teacher candidates in a recent screening interview. “Have you ever broken the rules because you thought it was in the best interest of a student? If so, please explain.”

This seemed to be the question that threw the interviewees for a loop. There was no scripted answer; this was not a question they had prepared for. This was a bit different. For all of those reasons, it was my favorite. There was no right or wrong answer, just insight into the type of person that was in front of me. Were they a rule follower no matter what? Were they willing to put themselves at risk for a student? Were they a team player that would fit in or were they a know\-it\-all who would do whatever they wanted to do, whenever they wanted to do it?

I received a few looks of confusion; some stumbled, convinced that this was a trick question posed to force a slip up. It wasn’t; I just really wanted an honest answer. How far would they go for the betterment of a child? Where would they draw the line? Their answers were telling:

“I changed special education testing scores because we all knew the child should be in special ed.”

Way too far.

“No! I would never break the rules.”

Not far enough.

“I stay after school to offer extra help.”

Great dedication, but I’m not sure in what school that is considered breaking the rules.

I was a bit discouraged until a candidate hit the sweet spot. She was a bit reluctant and seemed conflicted, but she finally shared that she had left her students with the classroom aide — a big no no in her school — because one of her students was having a melt down. This educator felt it was more important to take care of the needs of a child in crisis, a child she knew would respond best to her than to follow school protocols.

Yes! This is the type of rule breaker I want working with my students. She seemed to understand the sweat spot.

It is easy to sit on the side of the desk that asks the questions, much easier than the one on the spot, being judged. As the candidates struggled with the question, I reflected on my career.

How I would answer this question?

I have never been afraid to break the rules, cut away the red tape, go out on a limb. Looking back, I am proud of some of the times I was courageous and smart enough to do the right thing. At the same time, I thought of the mistakes, the times my pride got in the way, the times I thought I knew best and wasn’t even close. There is a fine line that must be finessed.

It is ok to disrupt, to do different, to stand up for what you believe, but we also have to step back sometimes, work within a system, trust others and avoid going too far off the rails. It is hard to discredit an educator who is not afraid to expose themselves for the betterment of a student.

I am proud of the time I was written up by my supervisor because I did not want one of my students to have to deal with one more thing in his life. I was a young physical education teacher and basketball coach. I used my prep periods to sign students out of study halls to play ball in the gym. This seemed to irk my fellow PE teachers and they brought their grievance to the principal. I was told to cease and desist immediately. This directive didn’t make sense then and makes even less now.

Although annoyed, I wasn’t yet brazen enough as an untenured teacher to disobey a directive. That’s why I was shocked when a counseling memo turned up in my mailbox. I later found out that one of my students who had been dealing with some pretty serious stuff at home came to the gym to shoot a few jumpers. When questioned, he explained to the principal that “Coach” said it was ok. With that information and knowing what my player was dealing with I signed the slap on the wrist and signed it without a moment of regret.

I am proud of those times I was brave enough to cut kids a break, take the heat for one of my teachers, find creative ways to make things better, or make a decision based on what was right rather than what was safe.

I recently laughed with a tech savvy, innovative instructor who reminded me of the year when I was the principal; I ran around our school setting up Apple Airport devices. A representative from Apple showed me how easy it was to tap into our network, allowing our teachers to access Wifi with the Ipod touch carts we were piloting. I went to the Apple Store, bought a few and rotated them around various classrooms while trying to avoid the looming eyes of Big Brother.

It was a bit of a cloak and dagger operation that got me cred with my teachers, but drew the ire of the District Tech department. This was completely evident by the official letter I received explaining “rogue devices” where exposing the entire District netwark. Looking back, maybe it wasn’t the best decision, but not one I regret. I got my teachers and students what they needed to be successful and forced the hand of the technology department to set up legit wifi in our classrooms.

That does not mean I am not ashamed of the times when a decision was based on self preservation. I am embarrassed thinking about times I was too pig headed to listen to others, times I was not a team player, times I broke the rules because I was too stubborn to see the reason why the rules were there in the first place.

One incident that comes to mind is almost too embarrassing to admit. I was doing my administrative internship and responsible for handling some low level referrals. There was a stack of about 30, one of which was one of my varsity basketball players. His offense warranted a couple days of detention. Not wanting him to miss any practice time leading up to the big game, I tossed the referral. I correctly assumed that no one would be the wiser; the problem was I knew and I knew I acted immorally. I had broken the rules not because this kid needed a break, but because I selfishly did not want his mistake to hurt the basketball team. I have never forgotten this indiscretion. The consequences being the guilt I have carried all these years, guilt that was way worse than detention would have had on the team.

This mistake led me to make a promise to myself. I didn’t promise that I wouldn’t break the rules, but I did promise that I would try to never break them for selfish reasons.

It is not black and white and there is no playbook. It takes passion, courage, and a strong backbone to break the mold, to do what you believe is right by your students, your teachers, and your school. It also takes confidence, thoughtfulness, humility to listen to others, to see an issue through a different lense, and, and even to refrain from being the rebel sometimes.

There is an art to breaking the rules, something that best educators understand, some by instinct some by experience. So, no, there isn’t a right answer to my interview question, but it sure does give me insight into the person I may be trusting with my kids for the next 30 years. I want someone who will take a risk for a student and breaks the rules for all the right reasons.

# By Dr. Christopher Nagy @DrCNagy

[Dr. Christopher Nagy](https://i.redd.it/vq50uzxbppz01.jpg)

The year 2007 created a tsunami of disruptive technologies that now impact how we work, study, live and play. In 2007, according to Tom Friedman in his latest book Thank you for Being Late \(2016\), the world experienced the greatest inflection point in history, and as a result, today’s world is forever changed due to those technological advancements in 2007. Key technologies were launched in 2007 that set the stage for the technology revolution we are experiencing today, and to a great degree, in the delivery of education.

Consider that in 2007, the Apple iPhone was introduced for the first time and Intel created non\-silicon chips for the first time to increase speed and processing. Both Facebook and Twitter were launched while Google purchased YouTube in 2007. In that same year, the Android processing system was released and Amazon set the stage for digital media with the launch of the first digital Kindle book. Companies such as Airbnb started without any real estate and IBM Watson was introduced for the first time setting up the initial phase of the artificial intelligence era.

The 2007 technology acceleration created new applications to learning. A case in point, this past year, my administrative team and I introduced for the first time, drone technology as part of our pre\-engineering program where students before graduating high school now sit for the test to be certified FAA drone pilots. We also introduced virtual reality as part of our welding, auto body painting and Law and Public Safety career programs. As a benefit of these technologies other than significant cost savings realized due to a decrease in product waste, we are seeing an increase in non\-traditional students enrolled in these programs once thought of as gender specific — the fear factor having been removed. Furthermore, as part of our three\-year strategic technology plan, we have embraced a digital learning environment that now includes the Google classroom, Google Suite of collaboration, digital books, web\-based programs such as Soundtrap, a competitor to Apple’s Garage Band as well as a host of social media channels that now capture innovation in and outside of the classroom. Furthermore, we are launching this summer, a Future Ready Institute for professional learning that will create opportunities for staff be certified in technology applications.

According to Friedman \(2016\), as the world becomes more interdependent and complex, it becomes more vital than ever to widen our view on the world and our lives and to synthesize more perspectives given that no one\-size fits all. To this point, technology venture capitalist Hemant Tanjeja in his latest book, Unscaled \(2018\), addresses the economies of unscale which is a process to unpack or unravel prior economies of scale achieved only by very large companies. With the help of new artificial intelligence technologies, emergent innovators can now compete against the giant companies. In fact, the small companies are now in a position to gain the scale of big companies by renting part of the big company platforms gaining scale almost immediately.

Another example of this shift in scale can be applied to many schools where there is unused space. I am proposing that we look at our schools, assess the availability of unused space and ask how we can create incubator spaces to rent to small companies. Depending on the size of school district and resources, the small companies could gain scale almost immediately that otherwise may take a small company five\-years to build. A benefit to the district in addition to revenue in this incubator example is the creation of a pipeline of real world internships or externships for students to apply what they have learned to inhouse company innovations.

The world today is driven by accelerations in technology, globalization, climate and geopolitics all interacting along a continuum simultaneously. This is illustrated by Nicco Mele’s seminal book The End of Big \(2013\) where he very astutely makes a case where the internet and social media make the proverbial David, the new Goliath. Supercomputers that were once only seen at IBM can now be carried in the palm of our hands as smartphones. Connectivity, immediacy and timeliness across continents, time zones and across cultures with the assistance of smartphones have been able to disrupt corporate boards and in other cases, bring down nations or mobilize a large group of people to demonstrate or protest.

ll we need to do is look at the work of Erik Qualman whose Socialnomics 2018 \(YouTube\) and his book Socialnomics \(2013\) identify key suggestions to navigate the social media age while highlighting the ten largest populations in the world. Interestingly enough, seven of the top ten are not focused on land masses such as China, Russia or the USA, but rather on people and how they are connected to one another. Among the largest populations are social media companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tencent, YouTube, Instagram and Linkedin. Depending upon the number of social networks individuals are enrolled, the degrees of separation move closer to three from six according to Niall Ferguson \(2017\). The world actually gets smaller the more connected we become. Ferguson also notes in his seminal work The Square and the Tower \(2017\) that social media companies tend to place followers in silos according to people of similar interests. This plays a major role for personal and professional lives. Today, students typically spend around five hours a day on social media. This presents an opportunity for educators to leverage that interest and seek to value social media as an interactive and informative tool that enhances the classroom experience.

The disruptive nature of technology places each of us in a position where we cannot afford to be content with the status quo or we become technologically and educationally obsolete. Futurists such as Jim Carroll and Gary Marx indicate that within a few short years, our resumes will reflect a list of discrete skills sets and credentials we have earned rather than list of jobs and degrees. Companies are interested more on problems to be solved and what skill sets are brought to their business. Some days, we feel as though we will never get to the top of the elevator because as fast as we go up, so too do technology and societal challenges.

The disruptive power of innovative technologies has also affected fields such as healthcare and social and emotional wellbeing. Recently across the nation, we celebrated in the month of April, Autism Awareness Month. Technological advancements in research noted by such neurologists as David Perlmutter in his book Brain Maker \(2015\), has bridged the gap between genetics and the environment whereupon the introduction of probiotics within the study of gut microbes has shown promise to reverse some of the symptoms of autism. Or in the area of exercise science and neurology, Zach Schonbrun’s book The Performance Cortex \(2018\) has shown how neuroscience is redefining athletic genius. Even looking back at the recent marriage of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle, the royal wedding ceremony reflected a significant shift in the normal pomp and circumstance protocol to a more modern and inclusive approach, another sign of the changing times and innovation.

Technology is also driving big changes in industry. Tesla the maker of electric cars, rockets and solar panels is seeing stiff competition as technologies become more readily available, prices for products go down. Who ever thought that Amazon would buy a grocery store chain named Whole Foods. Pilot programs are being run by UPS and Amazon with drones to deliver packages. Cell companies are looking to satellites to deliver signals to desolate areas. Companies such as Uber and Airbnb own no real estate or companies like Alibaba or Amazon own no inventory but are in the business to make connections. In recent years, Bitcoin has taken the financial world by storm. The technologies will necessarily change how financial institutions function. We have also witnessed seismic geopolitical changes be it in North Korea, China and Russia. In the end, these changes reflect this disruptive phase which has become our new normal.

When addressing my staff at the beginning of this school year, I noted that there are three ways to look at our world and our work and how we navigate within them, namely, to think inside the box, think outside of the box or look where there is no box and create a new pathway. I encouraged my staff to choose the latter for it encourages risk taking, innovation, entrepreneurship, engagement and creativity.

The world is generating more information and knowledge than ever before thanks to Moore’s Law and big technological advancements. This has a disruptive nature on our lives as educators and business men and women and necessarily changes how we think, work, process and play. As we look back to 2007 with an eye toward the future while navigating the present, we are challenged to embrace the changes technology present us and seek to be judicious, nimble and agile enough to grow personally and professionally as a result.

Today wasn't even a challenging day professionally or anything, but goddamn did I fantasize about drinking. I craved and fucking dug myself in a hole over it. At work I cruised mostly today. I had the intern around so I had her take care of some easy server closet stuff, and I basically spent my day planning my next week or two of work and making calls about apartments.

Towards the end of the day I kept thinking about stopping by my old favorite watering hole on the way home. The bartender there and I have hooked up a few times and I knew if I tried I could put the charm on and yada ya. Then I started arguing with myself and making deals with myself. *""Oh well I won't drink any more, its just to see Tiff and maybe get some."" ""Oh I won't even stop at the place if I don't see her behind the bar.""* On and on giving myself an excuse to stop by.

So I stopped by. I could see her from the curb and my requirements to drink had been met. The plan was to go inside, drink a bit with her, help her close and make a move. I was really happy about this. My weeks or whatever of sobriety have been boring as shit and I'm a super social person so I was amped for this. She looked great, had lost some weight in the last few weeks. After our hugs and hellos she asked me what I wanted to drink and I said 'Club soda with lime and ice.'

When it came time for me to pull the trigger and order the beer something stopped me. I was flooded with guilt about the promises I made myself. I was filled with so many emotions I lack the emotional maturity and literary skill to properly define them. I just didn't order beer. The club soda was awful. It tasted like copper pipes. She forgot the lime. I drank it very quickly while we talked about her recent trip. I talked to a guy about bicycles and I took a quick exit.

On my bike ride home I was flooded with anger about my inability to do what I wanted to do, anxiety about having to handle this new apartment situation, and doubt about even trying to improve myself. *""What's the point?""*

I don't have a happy ending for this. I'm angry, anxious, and sober."

I am looking for an internship over this summer while I am visiting my family back in Phnom Penh.

I have taken several computer science and electrical engineering classes such as : Data Structure, Object Oriented, Circuit Analysis, Assembly Language, and Computer Design.

I used to be a tutor at my college and I could tutor most of the math and physics classes such as calculus I II III, statics, mechanic, electromagnetic, and electricity."
8lpc20,0,2018-05-23,Lost MY Job Today And Trying To Process It,NoviceWSBer,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8lpc20/lost_my_job_today_and_trying_to_process_it/,"So I am a recent graduate-ish. I finished all of my course work at NJIT in December but I have an outstanding balance that I can't pay without a loan. I'm not allowed to take a loan due to not being currently attending the school. Eventually I found out I can take an NJClass loan but I have to be making $40,000 a year to qualify. 



So I had this job with a good contractor since last August. I was referred by my professor. It was a very small company. It was made up of the owner, his wife, a secretary, a project manager, and an estimator working out of PA. The owner is a very hands on manager. He literally goes out to work the crane on his biggest job site all day until 6 or 7 pm. 



I started out getting $15/hr with the promise that we will revisit it when school starts again (my last semester)know despsite making more in previous internships. However, I wanted to continue working there after graduation so I was willing to get less in the beginning. Also, I had just lost my job because the previous contractor had very few jobs that he didn't have much work for me. 



Fast forward, I have been back in school for a month. I asked the owner to discuss my pay as agreed (it's very hard to get a hold of him). He said, ""alright, let's revisit it next week."" 3 more weeks pass, I remind him. He just says ""they didn't change your pay?"" And was then given $18/hr. No discussion or anything. 



Fast forward to the end of school, I speak to him again about getting paid more now that I finished my coursework. He told me that they usually have a 6 month grace period to try out new hires but I have been working there for a bit so it should be shorter. He also instisted he wouldn't discuss what the raise would be. 



Fast forward 4 month, I am doing a bit of estimating and errands every now and then. I still don't feel confident estimating on my own because I don't know how things are built. I was not provided a chance to stay on a job site to learn how everything was constructed. I tried to talk to him multiple time about my pay but it was never a good time. At this point I have also been late a lot due to the job being an hour drive away and due to having problems with my old rusty car thats trying to drive 130 miles everyday. And called our a few times due to my back getting stiff in the morning (I have back problems). However, I have always done my work even when I was home. Eventually I get talking with him, he said that I have been late and called out and said let's give it another week and he still wouldn't talk about what the pay would be. 



I lease a new car to alleviate some of the issues. 2 month later (now), I'm at work and get a call from him telling me that we don't have any jobs after memorial day and we haven't been winning bids (true) and he has to lay me off. He apologized and offered to write me a recommendation if I need it. I thank him and pack my thing, they give me my paycheck and that's it. 



I couldn't believe it the whole ride home. I was counting on that job. My loans are about to hit repayment, I was counting on the raise so that I can get the loan, pay school, and have access to my degree and transcript. I'm also on the verge of getting engaged, I had just saved the down payment for the ring and was planning on buying the ring and proposing next month. Plus the extra money that I'm now paying for the new car that I got especially for this job because it was such a long drive.



Haven't told my fiancee-to-be yet because I don't want to worry her. She has always been very supportive but we are also rushing move things forward and I don't want her to stress over it. Delaying the engagement is a last resort at best because her parents already book the hall for the engagement party and I'm trying to inconvenience them as least as I can. 



My professor really like that guy and said he was ""the most honest contractor [he] has ever met."" However, I still feel like I was tricked. 



Edit: forgot to mention that I was studying civil engineering and the contractor was doing marina work (bulkhead, piles, etc.) And our construction program is bare minimum and doesn't even talk about the different types of construction so I knew nothing.



Tl;Dr: worked for $18/hr 6 month after graduation, got laid off, now I have to figure out how to pay for new car, get loan, and pay for engagement ring within a month."
8lpgdp,1,2018-05-23,"Sudden CVT Failure on 2006 Murano at 170000km no cvt codes, no signs whatsoever",redditgol,Nissan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nissan/comments/8lpgdp/sudden_cvt_failure_on_2006_murano_at_170000km_no/,"Basically what the title says, the CVT failed suddenly yesterday the car jerked and stopped at this point the engine would rev but the car does not move, no power to the wheels. I bought the vehicle at 141000 km, and used it on the Highway for 90% of the time. I took it in to the Nissan dealership and they basically said it happens sometimes but very rarely, they couldn't find any real cause for the failure; the fluids were very well taken care of, no accidents etc... Every thing works great the engine runs every time even in -20 or below (Canada), suspension, and interior is great but the CVT is shot.

Now at this point the repairs are about 4700$(CAD) and the car is worth about 6-7k, and I definitely don't want to repair a CVT cause it feels like a lottery.

Now this happened as I was leaving work luckily I wasn't going fast(pulled about a meter out of the parking spot), because the wheels locked up and the car did not budge when pushed! Luckily this happened as I was leaving the parking lot from my work, if it happened a couple of kilometers down when I was passing a freeway I would have been stuck perpendicular to oncoming traffic. The bizarre part is that it went from working to dead in a day! When I drove it to work the car behaved normally, I was driving down the highway which is about a 50km commute one way.

The dealership says its past warranty so they can't do much other than try to talk with Nissan as this could have caused serious injury, they are willing to give a me 1k(trade in) for it for now until they can get something from Nissan which is slim unfortunately; and the best trade atm is a 2005 Nissan Frontier with 224000km on for 12000$!!!!!

Do you guys have any ideas? I am a student working an internship so money is tight especially since I have to go back for a year...."
8lpi1z,6,2018-05-23,New CS Transfer,abrail,VirginiaTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/8lpi1z/new_cs_transfer/,"I just got into VT! CS students, I need advice. What classes would help me the most for maximizing my chances at getting internships for next summer? I want to factor in which classes help students get through interviews and build portfolios for internship applications. If there's any related advice you all can give, feel free!

I will have credit for CS 1114, CS 2104, MATH 2534 and two CS 2XXX courses when I transfer. I'm guessing that the best CS/math courses for next year for me are: 

First semester: CS 2114, MATH 3134 (I heard Karcher was good?), [non-CS/math classes]

Second semester: CS 3114, CS 2505, CS 3714, [non-CS/math class]

Will I die on that schedule? And can I do any better for my internship prospects than that?

Also, bit of a random question but what exactly is Koofers? It looks like I could find some really useful stuff to prepare for my classes in the fall. Can I sign up for a trial and then just scrape the stuff that will help me prepare? Or is that considered cheating in some way?"
8lpsc8,4,2018-05-24,Guess its game over. -long.-,Alyssa_Hargreaves,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/8lpsc8/guess_its_game_over_long/,"So I know I've not updated in a way and this might be a last one for a while as well. Depends on if I can get myself to update. But yea its bad. 

So the car is semi fixed, meaning it gets me to the town over but I'm not allowed to drive past that. I'm not allowed to drive the 30 miles it is to the mall where their are a lot more jobs because it won't make it apparently. But not my choice. SD's choice only. The job? its a joke. 

I work with a temp agency and they fucking suck. First job they place me in, decided to disregard all temp agency rules, *max they want us working is 10hrs.* job tried to force us to work 12 and 6 of those hours without a break. We had our last break before 4pm, and wanted us to work non-stop till 8:30/9pm without a 15 min break or any kind of break. so yea. 

Second job which was supposed to start today. HA. Guard never showed the fuck up to let us in. *Gated job, due to the fact they are packaging food items to the extreme amounts. You need a badge to activate the censor on the guard rail to get in. NONE of us had one, and none of us could follow a car and get in. we could lose our jobs doing so and they could as well* So called my supervisor and told her what the fuck, she told me to wait till 4pm *4pm is when shift STARTED, so first day we'd be late* I waited till 4:30pm to get in and no guard came up to us at all. Basically said fuck you all. So again no work. I get to try again Tuesday if I go that route, I may go to a different temp agency. Because I'm tired of SD's shit about me not working. 

Within a week of the last jobs bullshit he was asking ""did they call? did they call? did they email you? what's going on??"" meaning when the fuck are you back to work so I can stop being a father. When they called me IN FRONT OF HIM. He was like ""finally, it was getting close to the wire"" he was thinking I wasn't gonna be able to get the 5k alone and he'd have to ""Drop it all himself"" meaning hold thousands of dollars over my head like he was going to anyways. But he doesn't have to worry no more. He doesn't have to pay a fucking cent.. 

Because I can't move. At all. I've no means of going anywhere. Hell I can't even afford to drive to the gym! and its 20 mins away roughly due to traffic and being on the other end of the two towns. I can't bring myself to spend any gas if I can help it. Hell I gotta use the 6 dollars in change from dinner *that he so nicely paid for* to put it in the tank! Just to ensure I got some gas in the car. 

I have only one job I can take and that means getting my CDL but that means I can't leave for a year. I'd be in a contract because they trained me and such, even though I have to pay the bulk of the fees that are their. including $125 for a fucking permit! That I only have 6 months to pass the written exam AND Driving exam. If i can't do that in 6 months, I gotta pay another $125. SD knows this. And he knows I can't do much of shit without the book to study before practice/real exams. 

So he wins. 

I can't leave without 5K because 6 months of rent is nearly 3k. and the other 2k would have to go to bus passes for at least 6 months AND Electric payments/deposit because my credit is shit because of him. Also he won't admit he owes the cable bill now. Its in my name so he has no legal ties to it. Back then I was to naive and stupid to put it in a contract he would pay it etc. Because he made me commit fraud doing so. *I had no job, I was not self-employed. I had NOTHING in the ways of payment or jobs. I was a damn college student! I needed wifi strictly FOR CLASSES. He was the one who decided to upgrade it to fucking cable and shit! * So because I lied my ass off I can't go after him for money for it. I have to hope he decides to do the right thing and pay it. HA. 

Oh and the best part! I lose my insurance at 26 *federal law about kids on your parents plan until 26. I was a lucky one to i guess keep this shit going* But the thing is, the insurance does not leave my state. I tried for weight loss surgery OUTSIDE of -homestate- I got told sorry we don't accept it because it is specially for -state- So any surgery I need or could use done, has to be here. And NO ONE will qualify me for it. So no weight loss surgery, no breast reduction, no skin removal unless I beg and plead with a doctor to convince insurance to allow me it. That means When I somehow can move, I lose the insurance that barely is their. Its why I have metal rimmed glasses and not plastic. Because I don't have enough insurance to cover more than a pair a year and a replacement a year *I went through that with plastic and warehouse work* So somehow I have to get the money for my normal doctor to fix my medications, for a dentist somehow *been a decade since I saw one* weight issues, GYN issues and everything else. And I can't go to a good therapist without paying out of pocket because no one takes this shitty insurance. 

And a good therapist will run me 50+ dollars per copay because its a thing that to get a safe one I gotta pay outta pocket. I can't do that. I have to rely on him to see a NORMAL DOCTOR! Because I can't pay a copay, I can't pay for my meds, I can't do shit. 

Overall, I barely feel anything anymore. I have no desire to eat or even play the games I enjoy playing, I just don't care anymore. and as Morbid as its gonna sound, but at least I'll lose the weight now. Maybe then I'll be able to get a good job. Hell looking into stripping again if I could get to the clubs, but to far of a drive. And back to using a sugar daddy site again. 

oh and my friend is more likely to move before I am. They got an amazing job offer/deal and is set to work that soon and is in a contract so they can't move yet. Gotta be vague cause yea they'd kill me if I revealed anything bigger or what they make. Just know its more than I make now in a job assignment. 

oh and to top it off, I can't get into my chosen field because every law firm requires either 2yr experience in said type of work, or a 4yr degree, or a 2yr degree with 2yrs experience. So no law firm will take me. No court jobs, nothing concerning law even a unpaid internship won't take me without a 2yr degree. 7 fucking credits off *7 classes equal 7 credits in a way* I need 2 math classes, 1 English, 1 computer science *intro to PC Apps, yea stupid I know* 1 Western Civ I, and 2 humanities which can be anything under that category, like US History I &amp; II or American Lit and such. That's it. And you know how much that is? close to 10k now because the community college raised their fucking prices and I'm pretty sure the amount I saw was for ONE semester not both. And I can't go back until I pay the $1900 I owe, and SD never kept his promise on that to help me. *I shouldn't have expected the help but I was naive and before I got on here* so yea. I'm completely fucked over. 

I've nothing left, no job, no degree, a barely usable car, a medical condition that basically has told me ""use IVF or no children"" so that's no deal. I don't have the 10k It can cost me for ONE round of IVF and that is with a doner. without a doner try 15K. 

I'm just...on, its game over for me. No money, no life, no way to date, just basically gonna be alone for the rest of my pathetic life. 

And SD knows it. *yea he had to tie in a major way* He told me ""I don't know what to tell you"" when I told him the place I was gonna go to, raised their rent prices and I can't pay nearly 900 dollars for a one bedroom and I can't get onto student housing. He dangled up to 5k in my face and when it came to basically pay up he snatched it away. And to pay the weekly place its close to 1200 a month their, (250ish a week plus taxes/deposit etc) So he's once again gotten what he wanted. I can't leave unless I find a man to marry me or a sugardaddy willing to pay my way out to -state- or someone feels bad enough for me to pay the rent for both of us alone until I can get work. And I could never let that happen. so yea. he's won. I can't leave. I'm basically stuck at home paying his bills and taking care of him when I do get money....Guess I should look into filing bankruptcy after all since I can't pay my debt myself, though I don't think I'm in debt enough for it...guess I'll find out later....

night everyone...I'll check comments etc later tomorrow...yea..."
8lpuib,3,2018-05-24,How to define what I do at my current job?,Susy_La_Adelita,EngineeringJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringJobs/comments/8lpuib/how_to_define_what_i_do_at_my_current_job/,"TL;DR: I don’t know how to define the work that I do (or even the position at work) for my resume. I tried to detail my job functions in the listed items below. I am looking to switch jobs so wanted your guys’ help.

Hello all. I don’t know if this is the place to ask so I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. I am basically looking to switch jobs and wanted to make myself more desirable to new software companies than I was when I graduated. I had a rough time finding jobs out of college since I didn’t have internships and therefore wanted advice on how to describe what I do in terms that a regular software company hiring manager might be able to judge my abilities.

I recently graduated from a university in the southeast US with my Electrical Engineering degree. I learned a lot of programming and did a bunch of projects ranging from embedded systems to android apps. I finally found a job at my current company but wanted to move to an actual software engineering company with better pay.

I currently work at a service company (tutoring company) that uses Google Sheets to manage all its information and run day-to-day business. I had been hired as the web designer since they wanted someone in house with web experience (that they didn’t need to pay as much). But I quickly moved over to general IT (as I want to call it). Basically, I introduced the idea of using Google Sheets to maintain and manage data and, using Google App Scripting, make the process as automated as possible. We already have a POS System from Square. But since our company is a service company and we feel Square isn’t really geared towards service companies yet, I had to find workarounds for a bunch of daily and monthly functions.
My basic functions are:

* Created and maintained an active daily appointment sheet using Google App Scripting with Google Sheets that pulls data from our POS system and is a dashboard for our admin staff to perform daily duties such as charge customers for appointments, verify all appointment details, measure complete employee hours and mark special transactions for future keeping (such as unpaid tickets, prepaid customers, etc.).

* Made a system for logging daily student attendance with digital signatures. I built a custom front-end to let tutors see only their respective students every day while all the data is managed through Google Sheets.

* Created a messaging system between tutors and students (and their families) using Google’s Gmail Service. Basically, the back-end is managed by Gmail and again Google Sheets while the front-end was built to have tutors send session notes to students through an app.

* As the web developer, I also improved the website with structural updates that had to do with the fact they were using a theme in WordPress before. I also do daily updates such as putting in new hires on the website and setting up online booking for appointments.

Since our client base is quite large (around 1500 customers), after I joined, I have been able to reduce a lot of man hours through automation (I understand I might have to give exact numbers on my resume).

I apologize for the long post. Please let me know if there is a better place to ask this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I want to go somewhere that might provide more structure and sophisticated tools and of course better pay. Thanks so much!"
8lq2oi,1,2018-05-24,Me [19 F] with my [21 M] boyfriend? of 5 months are in a complicated situation.,DryEchidna,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8lq2oi/me_19_f_with_my_21_m_boyfriend_of_5_months_are_in/,"TLDR; [Foreign student swept me off my feet, but didn't want a serious relationship per say, though he's stuck through with me for 5 months. Really, I think he gave the relationship a more comforting label.  What should I do?]

I met him at university during first semester in one of my classes, but we didn't go on a date until the beginning of second semester. He took me out to a fancy Italian place and paid for everything. The chemistry was insane, and our date lasted six hours.

We went back to university, where he said ""the only thing that could make this night more perfect is if I could sleep next to you tonight."" So I was like ""woah, I'm not that kind of girl, but we can go out some other night."" And he said, ""no, I swear--just sleeping."" So I went back to his place, because I was attracted to him. We spent the entire night laughing, making out, giving each other massages, cuddling. The next morning came, and he didn't want to let me leave his room, and I thought it was cute. I had to study, so of course he let me go my way, and he texted me later he was already falling for me. This was too much, so I told him it wouldn't work out.

Fast forward to later that day--I told him I'm being stupid and I only like a-holes, and here I have a guy who actually likes me, and I'm letting that go. So we agreed to see where things went. I asked him later on if he wanted me to be his girlfriend, and he said that because he's from a different country and has to leave in a year, it doesn't make sense to be completely serious about this because there's a deadline to the relationship.

So, I asked then, what is this, and he replied: More than friendship, less than a relationship--still insisting this wasn't casual. (To me, this is a relationship under a different name--but he didn't want to define it so.) He later tells me he wants to be in a relationship with me, but knows he can't because of x, y, and z.

My grandma died at some point, and he came to see me on the day that she died so we could drink together and I could mourn. If I tell him I have a PTSD attack from my past after the fact that it happens, he always insists I should have called him so he could have been there.

We go on and off for a month, where I see other people. I had already fallen for someone else by the time he came back, apologizing for being so wishy-washy and saying he was still interested in me. I wasn't so receptive to him at first, but as I realized that it wouldn't work out with the other guy, then I started seeing him more. When he found out he had a summer internship, he suggested we hang out over the summer, and that I could stay with him/cook with him/have fun with him.

It feels natural to fall for him, but it's scary. He and I started seeing each other once or twice a week, even though he would pull three all-nighters a week to study for his degree because his major is difficult. It wasn't until the end of the semester that we slept together, and it was very sudden and unplanned. Being a victim of abuse, he knew my past. I was shaking and crying after, not because of him, but because of my past. He held me until I calmed down and kissed me/cuddled with me/gave me massages for hours that night. He had to go back home after the semester for a month to visit his parents, but promised he would see me when he comes back. Even on the day he left, he said he would see me when he comes back.

But, he has a reputation as player at university. It doesn't make sense for him to invest 5 months into a single girl if he's playing me, so I tried not to think about it. We were talking every single day for the first week he was gone, and now we talk maybe twice a week. He will be back in 5 days.

What do I do about my situation? Is it worth it to try and purse a relationship with him?"
8lq4ef,2,2018-05-24,How to define what I do at my current job?,Susy_La_Adelita,Engineering_Jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Engineering_Jobs/comments/8lq4ef/how_to_define_what_i_do_at_my_current_job/,"TL;DR: I don’t know how to define the work that I do (or even the position at work) for my resume. I tried to detail my job functions in the listed items below. I am looking to switch jobs so wanted your guys’ help.

Hello all. I don’t know if this is the place to ask so I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. I am basically looking to switch jobs and wanted to make myself more desirable to new software companies than I was when I graduated. I had a rough time finding jobs out of college since I didn’t have internships and therefore wanted advice on how to describe what I do in terms that a regular software company hiring manager might be able to judge my abilities.

I recently graduated from a university in the southeast US with my Electrical Engineering degree. I learned a lot of programming and did a bunch of projects ranging from embedded systems to android apps. I finally found a job at my current company but wanted to move to an actual software engineering company with better pay.

I currently work at a service company (tutoring company) that uses Google Sheets to manage all its information and run day-to-day business. I had been hired as the web designer since they wanted someone in house with web experience (that they didn’t need to pay as much). But I quickly moved over to general IT (as I want to call it). Basically, I introduced the idea of using Google Sheets to maintain and manage data and, using Google App Scripting, make the process as automated as possible. We already have a POS System from Square. But since our company is a service company and we feel Square isn’t really geared towards service companies yet, I had to find workarounds for a bunch of daily and monthly functions.
My basic functions are:

* Created and maintained an active daily appointment sheet using Google App Scripting with Google Sheets that pulls data from our POS system and is a dashboard for our admin staff to perform daily duties such as charge customers for appointments, verify all appointment details, measure complete employee hours and mark special transactions for future keeping (such as unpaid tickets, prepaid customers, etc.).

* Made a system for logging daily student attendance with digital signatures. I built a custom front-end to let tutors see only their respective students every day while all the data is managed through Google Sheets.

* Created a messaging system between tutors and students (and their families) using Google’s Gmail Service. Basically, the back-end is managed by Gmail and again Google Sheets while the front-end was built to have tutors send session notes to students through an app.

* As the web developer, I also improved the website with structural updates that had to do with the fact they were using a theme in WordPress before. I also do daily updates such as putting in new hires on the website and setting up online booking for appointments.

Since our client base is quite large (around 1500 customers), after I joined, I have been able to reduce a lot of man hours through automation (I understand I might have to give exact numbers on my resume).

I apologize for the long post. Please let me know if there is a better place to ask this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I want to go somewhere that might provide more structure and sophisticated tools and of course better pay. Thanks so much!"
8lqdpu,3,2018-05-24,"I lost my first job out of university in January, I am still unemployed.",verbing_noun,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8lqdpu/i_lost_my_first_job_out_of_university_in_january/,"At about this time last year, I was graduating from a university in DC.

As a foreign student, I thought I should take the opportunity to get a job in the states and get some overseas experience. So I applied for OPT, and set my sights on a paid job, since I did not want to do another unpaid internship. It was a very near thing. I ended up having to get an internship at a think tank, and after a month I got the call that I was hired for a market research job. I was so happy

I lasted 7 weeks at that job.

The job seemed easy enough, research markets and write reports. I knew another classmate there, she seemed to be doing well. I did my work, I did my best. I made mistakes. I did not ask enough questions, did not want to seem lazy, and my superiors did not like my work. I tried to improve but it was not enough, they let me go in the first week of December. Right before my lease on my room was ending.

I chose to go back home.

There were no opportunities to get a job in the short run. I decided it made the most sense to go back home, try it out there. I stayed with my then girlfriend for a month, partly out of necessity, partly because I was not sure when I would see her again. There were rough spots, I was really down for many days. We left saying we would try long distance. It lasted about two months. I try not to begrudge her over this, the emotional strain I was putting on her was hard, and she had her own responsibilities and interests to fulfill. She has since stopped talking to me, saying I have been putting too much effort into mending our relationship because I want to distract from my job issues. I still miss her. 

It has been nearly 5 months. I am still looking for work.

I have been applying to jobs since Febuary, and nothing has happened. Yesterday, I was rejected from 3 jobs in 4 hours. Jobs I was in the midsts of interviews for.

I feel like a complete failure. I am living at home, with my parents (who have been extremely supportive), but I feel everything I have done has been a giant mistake. I feel like I cannot do anything, that I am by definition, good for nothing. Everything I do just seems to fall short. I feel completely adrift.

Antwoord van minister Van Nieuwenhuizen Wijbenga &amp;#40;Infrastructuur en  
Waterstaat&amp;#41; &amp;#40;ontvangen 23 mei 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
Heeft u het bericht “Wachtrij voor afrijden” 1&amp;#41; gelezen? Wat is uw reactie  
op het feit dat de wachttijden om af te rijden fors worden overschreden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
Ja.  
Ik vind het heel vervelend dat de wachttijden zo oplopen, vooral voor al  
die mensen die hun rijbewijs nodig hebben voor hun werk, maar ook voor  
jongeren die klaar zijn met hun opleiding en graag zo snel mogelijk willen  
afrijden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
Deelt u de conclusie dat het probleem is ontstaan door een gebrek aan  
examinatoren in relatie tot de sterke groei van de vraag naar examens?  
Heeft dit ook te maken met de nieuwe leeftijdsgrens vanaf 17 jaar?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
Het is een kwestie van zowel vraag als aanbod. De vraag naar examens is  
zeer sterk gestegen: sinds 2014 is het totaal aantal praktijkexamens  
gestegen van 630.000 naar 735.000 &amp;#40;prognose 2018&amp;#41;, circa 17%. Om aan de  
stijgende vraag tegemoet te komen heeft het CBR afgelopen twee jaar nieuwe  
examinatoren geworven. Deze zijn sinds 2016 intern binnen het CBR opgeleid.  
Het CBR ervaart dat het steeds moeilijker wordt om geschikte kandidaten aan  
te trekken vanwege de krapte op de arbeidsmarkt.  
Het effect van 17-jarigen is inmiddels gering; dat effect is wel opgetreden  
toen de vraag naar examens van de 17-jarigen bovenop de gewone vraag kwam,  
maar is inmiddels gedempt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
Deelt u de mening dat de nu geconstateerde groei geen verrassing mag zijn?  
Kunt u aangeven hoe het komt dat het Centraal Bureau Rijvaardigheid &amp;#40;CBR&amp;#41;  
toch zo verrast is door de groei?  
   
Antwoord 3  
Het CBR is niet verrast door de groei van de vraag naar examens  
personenauto. Die is nagenoeg conform groeiprognoses. De vraag naar examens  
voor vrachtwagen, bus, trekker en taxi verloopt veel grilliger, is daarmee  
niet goed voorspelbaar en blijkt sinds 2014 jaarlijks te variëren: van 26%  
extra in 2016 &amp;#40;t.o.v. 2015&amp;#41;, via 20% extra in 2017 &amp;#40;t.o.v. 2016&amp;#41;, naar 10%  
extra in 2018 &amp;#40;t.o.v. 2017&amp;#41;.  
Naast de moeilijk voorspelbare vraag naar de beroepsexamens hebben meer  
kandidaten B-praktijkexamen gedaan dan de prognose was: 0,9% extra. De twee  
belangrijkste oorzaken hiervan zijn dat meer gebruik is gemaakt van de  
tussentijdse toets bij het CBR tijdens de rijopleiding, wat uit het oogpunt  
van kwaliteit een goede zaak is. De andere oorzaak is dat meer jongeren  
direct na hun 18e verjaardag examen willen doen dan voorheen,  
waarschijnlijk als gevolg van de verbetering van de economische situatie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
Heeft u de overtuiging dat het CBR de achterstanden werkelijk gaat inlopen  
op de wijze zoals het CBR aangeeft?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4   
Het CBR heeft een plan gemaakt met maatregelen voor zowel de korte als de  
langere termijn en zowel aan de vraagkant als aan de aanbodkant.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Aan de aanbodkant blijft het CBR nieuwe examinatoren actief werven en  
opleiden.  De interne opleiding van het CBR zal medio 2018 gecertificeerd  
worden op het vereiste wettelijke niveau voor een examinator. Daardoor  
wordt de doelgroep voor werving verbreed, immers het instroomniveau mag dan  
lager zijn dan het wettelijke niveau.  Ook zal het CBR op korte termijn  
inzetten op het zo goed mogelijk faciliteren van de transport- en  
logistieke sector: schaarse capaciteit voor beroepsexamens wordt door CBR  
gelijkmatig verdeeld over de examinatoren.  
Aan de vraagkant ondersteun ik de oproep van het CBR aan de rijscholen om  
kandidaten pas naar examen te sturen na voldoende vooropleiding en de  
rijscholen te vragen om de examens beter in te plannen. Een rijschool kan  
immers een examen zo goed mogelijk plannen en vooruit reserveren waarmee de  
wachttijd zoveel mogelijke tijdens de rijopleiding kan vallen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Echter ondanks de inzet van de maatregelen in het plan van aanpak is de  
verwachting dat de wachttijden niet snel weer op het gewenste niveau komen.  
Immers er zijn geen maatregelen in te zetten die op zeer korte termijn  
effect hebben zonder de kwaliteit van het examen aan te tasten. Ik bezie  
daarom samen met het CBR daarnaast in hoeverre prioritering van de  
verschillende examens mogelijk is.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
Deelt u de conclusie van het CBR dat de keuze voor een goede rijschool echt  
helpt? Kunt u aangeven welk deel van de wachttijden veroorzaakt wordt door  
de keuze voor slechte rijscholen?  
   
Antwoord 5  
Er zijn grote verschillen in slagingspercentages tussen regio’s en  
rijscholen. Op dit moment hebben 1.500 rijscholen van de ca. 8.000 die zijn  
ingeschreven bij het CBR een slagingspercentage voor het eerste examen van  
30% of lager. Dit betekent dat er kandidaten op examen komen die volstrekt  
onvoldoende zijn opgeleid en waar de examinator moet ingrijpen om  
ongelukken te voorkomen. Ook uit het oogpunt van verkeersveiligheid is het  
onverstandig om een dergelijk slecht opgeleide kandidaat de hele rit van  
het praktijkexamen af te laten maken. Het CBR beziet hoe daar op korte  
termijn iets aan gedaan kan worden, bijvoorbeeld door het afbreken van het  
examen in combinatie met een verplichte langere wachttijd voor het  
herexamen.  
Het is niet exact te berekenen wat het aandeel van deze slecht voorbereide  
kandidaten op de reserveringstermijn is. Wel is in algemene zin te zeggen,  
dat als het gemiddelde slagingspercentage, dat nu rond de 50% ligt, zou  
stijgen -zonder concessies te doen aan de examenvereisten voor  
verkeersveiligheid- de reserveringstermijn snel weer binnen de gewenste  
zeven weken wachttijd zou komen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
Zijn de namen van de ca. 1.500 rijscholen die kandidaten die nog niet  
voldoende opgeleid zijn naar het examen laten gaan bekend en kunnen die  
gepubliceerd worden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
Het CBR publiceert de examenresultaten van alle rijscholen al periodiek,  
zowel als open data op haar website &amp;#40;www.cbr.nl&amp;#41; als bewerkt op  
www.rijschoolgegevens.nl. Zoeken is mogelijk op plaatsnaam en op rijschool.  
Voor de zomer zullen deze gegevens op de vernieuwde website van het CBR nog  
prominenter te vinden zijn. Ik heb het CBR gevraagd om op haar website  
duidelijke informatie te geven ten behoeve van het kiezen van een  
rijschool.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
Kunt u aangeven wat de wachttijden voor de verschillende groepen nu zijn en  
in welke tempo ze worden ingelopen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
De actuele wachttijden verschillen per regio en per periode. Het CBR  
publiceert deze wekelijks op haar website www.cbr.nl.  
&amp;nbsp;    
1&amp;#41; De Telegraaf, 11 april 2018, 'Het CBR trekt een noodplan uit de kast om  
een einde te maken aan de rampzalig lange wachttijden voor het rij-examen.'

I apologize if this type of post isn't welcome, but I don't have many people to share with. My past made my job search history a bit rougher than needed. I dropped out of college twice due to mental health issues, working hard labor jobs in-between. When I was 21, I got my first IT job as an 'intern' with shit pay. Worked my way through a few jobs, advancing at every step of the way. From intern, to helpdesk, to operations engineer, to now. 

I just signed an offer letter to be a Senior Linux Engineer. 100% Linux Role. A lot of push for automation &amp; deployment. Chef, ansible, terraform, etc. The pay isn't super high (68k), but I live in a slightly lower COL area. I feel like this is a launching point for my career. I am 25 y/o, so I have time for growth. I'm most excited because this transitions my career from the mixed helpdesk/windows admin type role to dedicated linux sysadmin/engineer role. No degree...no certs. I made it! "

Hello all. I don’t know if this is the place to ask so I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. I am basically looking to switch jobs and wanted to make myself more desirable to new software companies than I was when I graduated. I had a rough time finding jobs out of college since I didn’t have internships and therefore wanted advice on how to describe what I do in terms that a regular software company hiring manager might be able to judge my abilities.

I recently graduated from a university in the southeast US with my Electrical Engineering degree. I learned a lot of programming and did a bunch of projects ranging from embedded systems to android apps. I finally found a job at my current company but wanted to move to an actual software engineering company with better pay.

I currently work at a service company (tutoring company) that uses Google Sheets to manage all its information and run day-to-day business. I had been hired as the web designer since they wanted someone in house with web experience (that they didn’t need to pay as much). But I quickly moved over to general IT (as I want to call it). Basically, I introduced the idea of using Google Sheets to maintain and manage data and, using Google App Scripting, make the process as automated as possible. We already have a POS System from Square. But since our company is a service company and we feel Square isn’t really geared towards service companies yet, I had to find workarounds for a bunch of daily and monthly functions.
My basic functions are:

* Created and maintained an active daily appointment sheet using Google App Scripting with Google Sheets that pulls data from our POS system and is a dashboard for our admin staff to perform daily duties such as charge customers for appointments, verify all appointment details, measure complete employee hours and mark special transactions for future keeping (such as unpaid tickets, prepaid customers, etc.).

* Made a system for logging daily student attendance with digital signatures. I built a custom front-end to let tutors see only their respective students every day while all the data is managed through Google Sheets.

* Created a messaging system between tutors and students (and their families) using Google’s Gmail Service. Basically, the back-end is managed by Gmail and again Google Sheets while the front-end was built to have tutors send session notes to students through an app.

* As the web developer, I also improved the website with structural updates that had to do with the fact they were using a theme in WordPress before. I also do daily updates such as putting in new hires on the website and setting up online booking for appointments.

Since our client base is quite large (around 1500 customers), after I joined, I have been able to reduce a lot of man hours through automation (I understand I might have to give exact numbers on my resume).

I apologize for the long post. Please let me know if there is a better place to ask this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I want to go somewhere that might provide more structure and sophisticated tools and of course better pay. Thanks so much!"
8lt6p6,13,2018-05-24,The Portal Of Time,Gasdark,LFTM,https://www.reddit.com/r/LFTM/comments/8lt6p6/the_portal_of_time/,"His pack heavy on his shoulders, he walked through the impermeable mist. It had fallen of a sudden over everything, thick and foreboding. Where before the distant plains extended in every direction, now there was nothing but cloudy gray. Only his feet were visible as he crunched across the gravel shoulder of the highway.

Behind him, some unknowable distance now, some countless number of steps and hitchhikes, was home. It called to him over the ebbing waves of his anger, pulling at the loose threads of loneliness and sentiment that trailed invisibly behind him no matter how far and how resolutely he marched.

But he would not turn around. To turn around was to forgive, and he refused. He held onto his righteous anger, stamping it deeper into his heart with each determined step. 

A truck came out of no where in the deep fog, swiping past him at outrageous speed. He froze in his tracks in the lingering wind, watching wisps of vapor spiral and curl in its gargantuan wake. 

In time, he began to walk again, moving or not moving, it was hard to tell, through the inscrutable haze. He walked for a long time and was getting tired when he saw a green aura in the mist up ahead. It glowed like a circular corona dispersed through the water vapor. It brightened as he approached and then disappeared, replaced first by a yellow aura and finally a bright red light. 

A stoplight. The red glow filled the air around him, lending the gloom an otherwordly tinge. His mother came to mind then, unnannounced. Her worried look. Hadn't he left without a word, without a letter? How many months had it been? 

In the glow of the red portal, he thought of home. The sedan took him from behind, lifting him up onto its hood and slamming the back of his head into its windshield. The light turned green again as he lost consciousness.

*******

He woke with a start. 

Tubes tethered him to machines and his arms did not work when he tried to reach for them. It felt like a monstrous creature was lodged in his chest and he struggled to breath. He panicked, barely able to lift his hands to bat at his mouth ineffectually, touching the plastic there. 

Someone entered the room, their strong hands on him, one under his head now, the other grasping the entity on his face and pulling firmly. He gagged at the intense sensation, like an eel being extruded from his lungs through his tight throat. 

When the ordeal was over, he gasped wetly and coughed and breathed. After a minute of struggling he calmed down and the nurse looked down at him pityingly. 

His voice would not come. He tried to move his legs and found them weak to the point of immobility. He managed a single word, slowly and as gravelly as the road he'd been walking on before.

""Wh...er...e?""

The nurse frowned and then pulled no punches. She spoke with firm, not unfriendly bluntness. 

""You're in the Hospital. There was an accident. You've been in a coma for some time.""

His mind lingered on 'some time'. What did 'some time' mean? Why didn't his limbs work? Was he paralyzed? 

""How...lon...?""

The nurse swallowed and looked to the door for help. She found none, then she closed her eyes and said. ""19 years."" Then quickly, ""Your muscles are atrophied, you'll need physical therapy."" She stood there for another long moment, not making eye contact. ""I'm so sorry"" she said and then walked out. 

If his hands worked he would have grabbed her arm. Instead she walked out and he was alone again in the fog. 

*19 years.* The number alone was terrifying. The reality of the number would come with time.

******
His mother was dead. It took the hospital several weeks to find out, but eventually an intern found her name on a public obituary along with a picture. It was her. She passed a month before he woke up. She never came to visit, of course, she had no idea where he was. 

For a long time, he was not sure how long, this news crippled him more than his dead muscles. He lingered, alone and empty in the hospital bed, being cared for like the invalid he'd become. 

In time, because he did not die and because he was too afraid to kill himself, he tried to live. He started on the long and agonizing path toward rehabilitation, teaching his dead muscles to work again, to twist and lift and pull. He was almost grateful for the pain of it, the excrutiating ache of each discrete muscle fighting against him at every turn. He viewed it as a penance, a Roman Catholic idea, he knew, but one that resonated with him now. 

It was six months before he could stand. A year before he could walk slowly on his own strength. He was set up in public housing, the shelter system, until he was signed up for disability. It took months for them to confirm his identity, but eventually he got his owm place. Within three years he was on his own again, finished with the hospital, alone. 

He never could do much after that. His muscles were too far gone and their rebound was limited. He could walk and carry a small bag and that was about it. 

So that's what he did. For years he roamed the country, surviving on government checks, looking for a place to make a life, and never finding one. 

Once he walked back to his home town and saw his old house and his old school. He had no siblings and no extended family, his father had disappeared a lifetime ago. It was always just him and his mother, and then he abandoned her over something that once felt so important, now meaningless, lost in time. 

Twenty years passed this way, roaming, always alone, always untethered, only the briefest, fleeting connections with others and then alone yet again. 

Until one cool night a fog came down over the plains. Heavy mountain clouds swelling and rolling down the cliffsides into the unbroken, sprawling steppe. It obscured his view completely, and left only the crunching of gravel underfoot. 

He remembered this fog as one remembers an old and frightful dream. He knew, as he took his steps, that a truck would pass to his left, dangerous and malevolent in the thick morass, and then it did, leaving eddies of vapor in its windy wake. 

He remembered the green aura before he saw it, and then the yellow and at last red, and once again he stood at the lip of the portal of time. 

Standing there, he fell to his knees and allowed a consuming wave of regret to pass over him as the headlights of a car approached from behind and cast his prostrate shadow into the cloud.

*****

He woke with a start. 

Tubes tethered him to machines, but he found he could breath easily. He lifted his hand to his head and felt the bandages there. 

A woman entered the room and looked at him with concern. ""Oh good, you're awake. You're a very lucky young man, you could have been killed.""

He tried to speak and found his voice was not lost or deadened with time. ""How long was I unconscious?""

The nurse looked at his chart. ""Only a few hours, we sedated you until the MRI results came back. But you should be fine in a couple of days.""

He felt different, stronger, as if a leak in himself had been sealed and life pumped back in. He made to get up and the nurse walked over to help him. 

""Careful now, you may be a bit dizzy. Need the bathroom?""

He *was* dizzy, but he nodded and together they walked over, his legs feeling strong under him, only using her hand for balance. They turned the corner and he entered the bathroom alone, shut the door and stood in the dark for a long moment before turning on the light. 

As the darkness lifted he saw himself in the mirror, his face young again, his head bandaged and bruised but no longer the face of an old, empty man. Hot tears streamed down his cheeks and he cupped his eyes in his hands, his back rising and falling with the ebb and flow of his sobs. 

From behind the bathroom door the nurse spoke gently. 

""Is everything OK in there? Do you need any help?""

He cleared his throat. ""No, thank you. I just need a minute.""

The nurse paused and then added. ""OK, in the meantime, is there anyone you want us to call? Family maybe, let them know you're OK.""

Another wave of tears washed over him bringing with them a thrill of joy. 

""Yes."""

By: Carrie Peck @MsPeckCounselor

[Carrie Peck](https://i.redd.it/1nsu41qemtz01.jpg)

Transitioning from Teacher to School Counselor has been an eye\-opening journey; one that has changed my educational mindset. No longer do I believe that students need to achieve academic success alone; I believe our students need to find their purpose in life thus creating their own goals for the future. Future planning for the next generation does not have to include college and career planning alone; a future can be as simple as “What activity do you want to try out for”, or “What organization do you want to help?” Our schools today have changed in educational need; students no longer need “JUST” the academic instructor. They often need the personal mentor; the person who is their coach in life and stability. Many educators often question this as a big task to undertake; especially when we are presented with many demands in curriculum and standardized achievement. Today our students’ demand requires time and love of the educator, more than the textbook definition. We need to find simple ways to show our students and families that education is now a work of the HEART.

**Lesson of the Heart ONE: Build School Climate Amongst Your Staff**

When I first entered my new school this year, I knew my biggest challenge was to let my staff of teachers know that I wasn’t “just” a school counselor, I was also a former educator. I was one of them for thirteen years. I knew the struggles of being a teacher; I knew the demands of education and the multiple roles that they carry. The biggest trial for school counselors is building that bridge of communication; letting the teachers know that you are on the same team sharing a common goal; helping the students succeed. Starting early in September I began sending monthly “Inspiration” emails on Fridays. Through these emails I share kudos for the week and ideas of how to make their classrooms warm and inviting with a variety of resources from various sites such as Pinterest, Teachers Pay Teachers, or education blogs created by educators themselves. The emails are detailed with links, attachments, and samples of work. I would even share tips that I utilized as a former teacher myself. Other times, these emails included resources and links to articles that describe current mental health trends and topics that educators may experience in our students today; such as trauma informed practices. Our school district, like many other, is trained to be trauma sensitive and aware. I will often share the latest research on how to place trauma sensitive practices into the classroom setting. Trauma resources can range from creating peace corners or sharing lessons on overcoming adversity and challenges thus instilling growth mindset, to placing posters in the classroom that just say “YET”, informing educators of word use and practice during specific times of the year, such as holidays. At the end of each email I always remind the staff of my availability for them, to listen and support; and even share chocolate from my office. Trust me, everyone loves chocolate, especially teachers after very long school days. Let your staff know that you are on Team “WE” not Team “Counselor” or Team “Teacher”; and watch the staff bonds grow.

Another practice of building staff bonds is working on staff projects that can be done together. One of our teachers saw my passion for change and approached me one day about creating a bulletin board together to display for the students. I jumped on this idea right away and together we created a colorful bulletin board that stated, “Lift Each Other Up” in the main hallway of the school. On the bulletin board you could see the scene from the movie “UP” with the house being held up by 3D visual handmade balloons. We reminded students to lift each other up every day; to become peacemakers of their own school. With staff continuously make plans; get EXCITED about those plans. The more excitement you share, the more others will want to join and help. Future planning is the best practice for a growing school climate. With my co\-workers we already are planning to install painting projects throughout the school in the summer; creating a warm, welcome, and inviting school that students will want to walk into each day.

Finally, plans can also be inclusive of collaborative professional development. As a teacher, I often remembered participating in various book clubs on books that shared the latest in instructional practice. Another plan that I am putting into action for the staff is to create a book club for anyone who volunteers and shows interest. The list of books shared will be books that I have discovered on the internet, Twitter and recommendations from professional learning networks. I am including staff input and hoping to have the book club be diverse in educators from teachers, counselors, instructional coaches, to administrators, etc. The best way to gain a following for the book club is to advertise to your staff through conversation, email, google surveys, and of course Tweet it out! Remember share your excitement and your staff will want to know what all the chatter is about!

**Lesson of the Heart TWO: Hook Students with Creativity**

It often takes time and creative development during lesson planning to create student buy\-in. Ask yourself this question every time you plan an activity or lesson; “Would I want to listen to this lesson?”. Lesson creativity often needs to touch a spot in students where they may forget the lesson you teach but never forget how you made them feel. During my teaching years I often would dress up; especially if it meant that it would make the students giggle for the day or remember the concept just because Ms. Peck made them laugh. We often don’t know what baggage our students carry each day, but if we can instill the love for coming to school then we made all the difference in the world. We want students to crave and thirst for coming to school; all because they want to be around us, the educators. When you remember that your students are people with a multitude of opinions and feelings, your lessons will become stronger.

For instance, every year when I taught rounding to my students not only would they learn the rules via a rap song, “Rounding Rap”; it would be performed by their very cool rap artist guest, their teacher. I would put on the sunglasses, the black derby hat, and layer on the chain necklaces with the sparkly microphone. Let the drum roll please, as the laughter would ensue. The students instantly grasped that I wanted them to have fun; not just learn. The end of my school year always included a red\-carpet ceremony. The classroom smartboard would project movie star curtains and a red carpet, made from bulletin board paper, which would be rolled out onto the floor. Students would receive awards handmade by myself celebrating their achievements, unique traits and qualities they shared throughout the year. The award always included a picture of them and students were given a chance to make their own gratitude speeches. I ended my ceremony each and every year, telling my students how much I loved them and how special each and every one of them was. They learned that I wasn’t just their teacher for the year, but I was an adult who cared about them for a lifetime.

Presently, as a school counselor I don’t have a classroom of my own anymore, instead I have a whole school to care for. For counselors, begin your year by going into the classrooms, surveying the students, and assessing how much they know about the counseling program. Once the surveys are complete, introduce how you will run the program through an engaging presentation. At the end, give them a few tips for the year. The best advice I shared with the students this year was about hallway greetings. You will often hear me say to the student body, “Be sure you give a wave and smile; I truly look forward to getting to know you and seeing you each day.” Students know you care when you compliment, say hi, or just check in to ask, “How are you doing today?”. The smiles and the waves I see each day in middle school hallways are a sight to be seen.

Student relationships can be built with your presence whether it is in the classroom, individual, or small group modes. Create an atmosphere of relatability and students will instantly connect to your story. In the middle of this year I presented Anti\-Bullying Lessons and began each lesson by sharing my own personal story of struggle when I was their age. I shared the trials and tribulations of growing up with my own hearing impairment and the difficulties of finding peer acceptance. Students recognize that you become a place of assistance when your humanity is shared. No longer are you just the “authority”; you are a person in their corner. As a person in their corner, this year I collected the information from their student surveys and collaborated with my principal to introduce a new online character program, by an outside service provider, into the school curriculum. It was important that the program be presentable to the students in an engaging way. We also infused it into the curriculum which teachers had to get on board with. Engaging a variety of stakeholders to produce programs for student social\-emotional development is the best way to advocate for your students’ needs.

**Lesson of the Heart THREE: Reach out to your Community and Families**

As a teacher I always made the time to connect with my students’ families on a personal level. I would carve out time each week for phone calls and emails; keeping in touch with parents and guardians. Scheduling this time is often important as it saves the steps in the process of comprehending possible changes in student behavior. The most important question to ask parents in conversation is, “Has anything changed at home, so that I can help him/her further in school?” As a school counselor this practice has not changed; but now extends to a larger population. Looking for transition in a student’s life helps to create understanding, empathy, and patience when academic needs require servicing through more creative modalities. In the beginning of the year, I always share a “Back to School” letter introducing myself, my educational background, and my professional experience. Inform families of your purpose, program intent, and various ways to be reached. Another new initiative that I started this year is creating a guidance newsletter. The newsletter describes current events from the counseling program, tips for students for mental health awareness, and resources for parents to utilize online in support of their children. Quarterly this is distributed and is becoming another form of communication for both families and staff; advocating the needs of the students and how to service them. Family outreach is important; as many families often need to find connection with school staff in order to support their child within the home. Furthermore, advertising school pride to the outside community builds a connection to program offerings within your building.

Cultivating school relationships within the community is another vital piece to student development and sense of school belonging. The stronger we build connections with students to others in their community; we assist in developing student identity and character. For instance, during my counseling internship I worked with a student club to create Easter baskets for donation to children in a local hospital. Students worked for several weeks filling the baskets with homemade yarn bunnies, construction paper bunnies made from recycled toilet paper rolls, and filled eggs with candy surprises. This collaborative project along with my counseling supervisor, instilled the value of helping others in need. Students felt increased self confidence and worth by helping others, thus enhancing their desire to participate in future school events.

Disrupting a school requires passion of the educator. Roles and status do not matter when it comes to bringing about change. Change can be simple and does not have to be complex; starting with a simple hello in the morning. We need to continuously remind ourselves why we entered education in the first place; thus, making a difference in the lives that we touch. Building resilience for our students includes placing ourselves as role models, mentors, and innovators. To touch a life in the history of your career is equal to saving a life in the future. Begin your tomorrow with the words, “I CARE”.

I was never an intern myself, so I don't know what it is like and I am not even going to give them the test we give out to potential hires because they won't even stand a chance. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on possible training tools I could use? We use Trouble Maker to break servers for training, but is there a tool like that for Windows, so that I can test their basic PC skills?

8lu75k,15,2018-05-24,"[Rave] I stopped paying attention, but my emergency fund and nYNAB are keeping me together for the next 6 weeks.",cidonys,ynab,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/8lu75k/rave_i_stopped_paying_attention_but_my_emergency/,"Context: I’m 22, and just graduated college and moved into my first apartment. I start work in late June. 

I’ve been using nYNAB for the past few years. I had successfully built up a $1000 emergency fund, a $5500 post-graduation buffer, and some savings. I had a category for deferred income from my summer internship to use while I was in school and working part time. 

In mid-March, I stopped paying attention. I stopped logging my expenses. I kept telling myself “I have almost $6k to spend on moving expenses. I’m fine.”

So I bought a mattress. And a bed. And a dresser. And a bean bag. And rented a moving truck. And went out for dinner with friends for most of the last week of school. 

And when I finally looked at my accounts, I was in a worse place than expected. All my accounts were down to about $4k combined, from $12k. I panicked. Called my mom to tell her I’d probably need help with rent this and next month, until I get my paycheck, kicking myself. 

And then, with a backup plan set up, I sat down, called my dad for emotional support and a sanity check, and made a fresh start in YNAB, to fill it out with the necessities for the next 2 months until I get my first full paycheck. 

Step 1) Make sure I have all account balances up to date, including Splitwise indicating what I owe my flatmate. 

Step 2) In the titles of each savings category, add the pre-binge balances so I know what to aim for again to pay myself back. 

Step 3) Add a Rent category, put $2100 in it so I have a place to live regardless of everything else. 

Step 4) Set aside the Parent Bank category - this isn’t my money, it’s the money my parents gave me to spend on my sister’s medical stuff, since she’s nearby and they aren’t. It isn’t my money to spend willy-nilly. 

Step 5) Fill in my groceries, meds, and transportation budgets. All of these things are needs that I can’t get around. 

Step 6) Put in my credit card payment, so I don’t go into debt. 

Step 7) My driver’s license expires in 3 weeks, on my birthday, and I need to get my car registered in this state, so put aside money for that, and for car insurance. 

Step 8) Put aside $100 for home maintenance, because lord knows there’s stuff we forgot for the apartment. 

Step 9) Choose between new boots, and celebrating my birthday. My Doc Martens got sliced by accident, so I need to replace them before I start work, but I can get cheap $20 boots to replace them for now, so I can put the other $150 towards celebrating my birthday with my friends for the last time before we go all over the country. Put $150 aside for clothes for work, and $250 for my birthday (for now). 

Step 10) Everything Else. Put some money into monthly subscriptions (dropbox, iCloud, headspace), and throw the rest into the emergency fund. Cry inside because I’m missing the steam summer sale this year. 

I saw I could make it. There’s still a chance that I could need help from my parents, and I’ll have to do free/cheap dates for a while unless my boyfriend pays for me, but I was able to shift stuff around and make it work, and I’m confident I’ll be able to pay myself back. I’ve also finally filled my taxes, and once I get my return, it will go straight into refilling my emergency fund and repaying my other categories. 

If it wasn’t for YNAB, I wouldn’t have realized I was in trouble. If it wasn’t for YNAB, I wouldn’t have realized I wasn’t in as much trouble as I thought. "
8lub4p,101,2018-05-24,Never fuck with a bald man wearing magic pants,Ask_me_4_a_story,TheWokeBible,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWokeBible/comments/8lub4p/never_fuck_with_a_bald_man_wearing_magic_pants/,"Ahab was a bad motherfucker. Not the captain of Moby Dick, the other Ahab, the seventh king of Israel. He was married to Jezebel, and we all know she was salty. They had a fucked up kid named Ahaziah who was also an idiot. He was fuckin around in his upper room probably drunk or stoned or whatever and he fell through the lattice and injured himself like Bill Clinton falling down the stairs after a bender. Except without the intern. He probably had interns but he just made them his concubines because that was the style back then, when women were more like possessions. Anyway his leg was all fucked up and gross since he fell through the lattice and they didn’t have penicillin back then so everybody was like, you’re probably gonna die dude. He was like what, its just a flesh wound! So they all said go see Baal-Zebub. If we learned anything from Queen (The Awesome 80s band not that bitch Jezebel) we learned that Beelzebub had a devil put aside for me. For me. For me. And then you have to get through that if you want get to the part where it says We Are the Champions of the World like the Royals in 2015 and 1985. 

So Baalzebub couldn’t do shit for his flesh wound since he didn’t have penicillin either so Ahaziah was out of luck. Then Elijah met with the kings Production Assistant and was like, the fuck are you messin with Baalzebub for? Don’t you know he loco ese? And he has a devil put aside for you? You should be fuckin with the Lord, you don’t fuck with him anymore or what? Ahaziahs people were like, I mean, we’re not tied to BaalZebub, what you got? And Elijah said too late motherfucker, that bitch is dead. He wont even be able to get out of bed. And the PA was like, okay, we’ll tell him your message but he’s gonna be super salty. 

Ahaziah hears the news and hes like God damnit why do I live in the  BCs, this kind of shit is gonna be easy to fix in the future. Im gonna die from a lattice poke? Fuck my life! And who is this motherfucker talkin shit to my PA anyway? They said oh man, he was wild, clothes made out of hair, he was rockin a leather belt, weird motherfucker. King said, Oh I know that lil bitch, that’s Elijah, fuck that guy, go get him! And he sends his captain and 50 dudes to round him up. 

Captain is like, okay where is he? Turns out he was up on top of a mountain sitting crosslegged philosophizing and shit. Of course he was. Captain said, hey Elijah, get the fuck down here, the king wants you. Elijahs like Fuck Off Im on the mountain top! Literally. Then BAM fire comes out of the sky and BBQs the captain and the 50 dudes. So the king sent another captain and 50 more fighters to take Elijah in off the mountain top. Next captain gets burnt up too and those 50 guys. King is takin Ls and now hes down 100 but he keeps chasing the flush in this poker hand, he sends 50 more dudes and one scared ass captain. Third captain takes a knee during the national anthem before the game starts and hes like hey guys, listen, ya’ll motherfuckers can sing right? We gonna mix this up, lets come at this different so we don’t get burnt up! They were like bet, bet, lets do this performance thing! So they all stop takin a knee and he goes up to Elijah and he falls down on his knees and starts singing I don’t want to die today! I feel like Im outta my mind! I finally want to be alive. I don’t want to die today. I want to be alive. And he shouts out WHO CAN RELATE? And BAM all the troops jump in, they all sing along with the beat, they are like, I DONT WANNA DIE TODAY and it sounds good as fuck cuz they mean it. Elijah is like, oh damn, that song is tight, I can see your Logic. So he lets them all live and he’s like okay, I’lll go see the king. 

So Elijah goes to see the king and he said, yo that last group was on point, great voices, good beat some great Logic, I let those Pitch Perfect Motherfuckers live, that was a yes for me dog! How you doin king? And the king said oh man, not great, I fell out of the 2nd story and fucked my shit up on some lattice and penicillin hasn’t been invented yet so I cant get out of bed. And Elijah says, yeah, no shit, that’s what I told your PA in the first place, shouldn’t have taken those two Ls and lost 100 guys, you gonna die today. And the King started singing too he was like I don’t want to die today, I want to be alSHUT THE FUCK UP Elijah said, I already heard that song Im sick of it now, its played out, you're dead motherfucker. And he turned around and walked out and then Ahaziah got knocked the fuck out and died. Everybody poured out their liquor for him on the ground but not for long cuz he was a dick. Also liquor was expensive back then, this was before Jesus was mass producin that shit out of water.

So Elijah got tired of all the miracles and shit and decided to pass on his powers to his #2 Elisha since their names were so similar. Elisha was kind of a clinger though. He was always like you love me boss, right? Im your favorite Deuce. Elijah was thinking, yeah, you're the deuce I want to drop. And really Elisha wasn’t nearly as cool as Elijah. He couldn't do magic and the ladies didn't love him like they loved Elijah. But the main thing was that he was baldheaded and that wasn’t cool back then. They didn’t have Rogaine and this was before Michael Jordan so people didn’t like bald heads back then. Elijah was cool with it though, or just tired and ready to pass on his magic powers. He didn’t want Elisha to see him go though because it would be sad like that fuckin dog at the end of Where the Red Fern Grows except that book had some heart, the Old Testament was all raping and shit and they never talked about any dogs they had as pets so the story lacks a lot of depth. Anyway he wanted to avoid the sadness so he was like Elisha stay here with your bald head, I got to go to Bethel. And that fuckin clinger Elisha said nah, Im comin with you. Then he tried to shake him a few more times so he could do his last disappearing act but Elisha was so clingy he was finally like peace, Im out, my Uber is here. And it wasn’t just a regular Uber, it was an Uber XL, this fuckin chariot had fire and horses that could fly made of fire and Elijah’s clothes fell off because this was also a nude Uber XL Chariot, I forgot to say that, and he was like see ya motherfucker, you get all my secret magic powers, Im out! And people thought he went up to heaven up in the air or whatever because this was before Isaac Newton and back then the authors thought heaven was just above the earth and they never got around to editing that part of the Bible so they just left it in. They thought you could get somewhere up above on like a quick naked Uber chariot XL ride, they didn’t know about the solar system and gravity and all that shit. 

So Elisha freaks out and rips all his clothes off and he tears them up and runs around naked and everybody knows theres nothing weirder than an old ass bald dude running around naked. All of a sudden he sees a light shining down illuminating the magic pants that Elijah had stripped off, just laying there in a pile glistening in the magic light.  This was some real Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants shit and he quickly puts the pants on and all of a sudden he can feel the power. He strikes the water and it parts right down the middle, hes like SOMEBODY STOP ME! SMOOOOOKIN! And from then on he uses the pants to help him do all his magic tricks. But everybody standing around was confused, they were like, well the naked part was weird but the traveling pants part is cool, but where did Elijah go? We’ll go look for him, maybe the Uber took him to another mountain or some valley. Elisha goes, nah, if you find him I’ll have to give back these magic pants, don’t go chasing waterfalls! But they go anyway and look for him for three days because Elijah was way cooler than this weird ass naked bald motherfucker. They all come back after three days with their heads down and were like, well, I guess we serve you now. Elisha’s like I told you not to go chasing waterfalls, he's gone bitches Im in charge now! You suckers are my servants! Fuck yeah its on, first I got magic pants and now I get servants! 

They go to the next city called Flint and the people are like, hey, you have the magic pants now, right? Can you fix our water? The water here is all fucked up. Elisha is like bet, lets get this magic thing started. First Ima fuck with the water, then Ima get myself some extra large playing cards, then some Tigers, fuck yeah, can you imagine tigers that I train in a big cage and theres like some VegaELISHA Wake the Fuck up they said, you fell asleep and now you are talking out loud about Tigers. He's like, shit guys, sorry, I fell asleep there. Time to do some magic, you kids ready? They are like we arent kids but yeah, whatever, if we are doing magic now lets do this thing I guess. 

So for Elisha's first magic trick he had them bring him a bowl and he put water in it and he did some serious desalinization of the whole town. He was like God says no town named Flint will ever have fucked up water again! But he was wrong. 

His second magic trick was unorthodox to say the least. Everyone was pretty hyped about the clean water in Flint so they were pretty giddy traveling down the road. They were like, Elisha, can I try on those Magic Traveling Pants? He was like, fuck no, Im the man now, and its all because of these traveling pants! So they were all walking down the road and some punk ass kids came up and were like HA HA LOOK AT THE BALDY! GO ON UP YOU BALDHEADED FREAK! 

And Elisha was like OH NO YOU DIIIIIIIIIII-NT! Do you even see these pants you punk ass kids?! These are magic pants! How dare you make fun of my bald head! And he hits his magic pants three times right on his thighs and he yells out Shhhhhhiiiiiiiiii-CA-CAH and calls on the name of the Lord and all of a sudden two fuckin bears came tearin out of the woods and ate those kids up. All 42 of the kids died that day and that was Elisha’s second magic trick. Also a warning to never fuck with a bald dude wearing magic pants.

I feel like I can't really specialize if I'm going into community college, even if I do get whatever internships they offer. I just don't think it will matter because I won't be able to really sell myself even if I do have the energy to work beyond the bare minimum. I won't have any social skills or network, and frankly I'm scared that I will become a discouraged worker in a bad position. That being said, I kind of want to be a teacher, because I recently have found that I like seeing students mature and develop while taking an interest in their coursework, but, again, I don't want to become discouraged and feel like I am being forced to teach a certain way, only teaching the bare minimum and being assigned to gen ed classes. I have no real network now regardless, and certainly lack the charisma that it would take to succeed in either position, and I know I can't stay like this for too much longer or I will become discouraged and braindead. I need to talk with somebody."

8lutjr,4,2018-05-24,"Chad and Ellie Take Over the World, Part 3",ManEatingCatfish,ManEatingCatfish,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManEatingCatfish/comments/8lutjr/chad_and_ellie_take_over_the_world_part_3/,"Before Chad could even think about taking a trip to the capital of the Texaco United Front, he had to finish his chores for the day. Since his parents were absent and his mum hadn’t given them some kind of schedule, he just did what he did every day to make sure the house was in tip-top shape. As he strode through the corridor leading out of the oval office, he fired off orders on the ends of too-long-sleeves to whatever aide or intern looked in his direction. He made sure to look each of them in the eye, just like dad had told him to do to anyone who entered their house, because it could be very likely that that was the last time he would ever see them. The journalism interns were a bit surprised at being hugged closely, and for a bit too long, by the First Radmaster of the United Coalition. Those who would go to feed Kevin were given the longest hugs, and often found themselves reciprocating the gesture.

&amp;nbsp;

At the double doors leading out into the landing, Chad turned around and rubbed his nose. “Nice ladies and gentlemen, I’m sorry to ask so much from you. But I have urgent business with the Texaco United Front, and my mum taught me to take care of the house while she was away. Pleaaaaase be careful when you enter, and don’t touch anything that looks green. I’ve given you each very specific instructions, and you must follow those to the letter. This is a Radmaster order!” He unrolled his left sleeve with great frustration and some help from Spackler, and saluted the men and women furiously scribbling in pocket notebooks. “Thank you for your service.”

&amp;nbsp;

An aide snuck in from a side corridor and delivered a message into Spackler’s ears, which Spackler then related to the Radmaster himself. Chad cleaned out his right ear again, before nodding. “Which way is the lawn, there’s like seven stairways in here.”

&amp;nbsp;

Spackler’s moustache performed a shimmy of veiled frustration across his upper lip. The Vice President pushed the doors behind them and the rush of air blended by helicopter blades began to whip through the hallway. “This way sir, one floor down.”

&amp;nbsp;

Chad paused for a moment as Spackler began to descend the stairs, overcome by some hesitation that he was being fooled. He knew the political people probably didn’t like him, but this would be a stretch. And also far too obvious of a ruse. He rushed down to meet the Vice President. “Mr. Spackler, I thought we were taking the jet?” he asked, tugging on the pants leg of the elderly statesman.

&amp;nbsp;

“Yes, we are, sir Radmaster,”Spackler sighed, “the helicopter will take us to air force one.”

&amp;nbsp;

At this, Chad let a smirk play across his face. “Hmmm. Air force one…and?”

&amp;nbsp;

The already crumbling façade of decency shook away entirely. “Please don’t make me do this.”

&amp;nbsp;

Chad’s voice had risen to new heights. “Mr. Spackler, I don’t know what plane you could be talking about, there are oh so many that serve the government.”

&amp;nbsp;

George Spackler inhaled and held his breath until they had reached the bottom of the stairs. His face had turned several shades of red in the process. But only in front of the beating blades of the helicopter did he let the accumulated air seep out from his nose and mouth like wisps of steam.  “Air force one-three-three-seven, sir Radmaster.” he mouthed, hoping the chopping of the air would mask the words. The syllables had no force of vitality to them, they had lost the quality of human speech somewhere along the line. It sounded as if Spackler had whispered the words into a hollow cave, but what Chad heard was an echo warped by centuries of uncaring stone.

&amp;nbsp;

Chad’s smirk evolved into a smile as his feet bounced along the tiles towards the back lawn. Spackler lumbered behind him, wiping his brow with the handkerchief his grandfather had given to his father.

&amp;nbsp;

“Cookie Commissioner, we have located three potential land routes through Aquitaine,” General Cortez placed a squat finger along the France-Spain border, which bobbed up and down along with shot suspension of the Humvee, making it hard for Ellie to get a good read on it, “I would recommend the coastal route through Biarritz, but we can go through Bayonne or wrap around the long way through Pampelune into Pau.” The newly appointed general’s hand whirred across the Pyrenees, making lines and loops that Ellie would have barely followed if her vision was stationary.

&amp;nbsp;

“Uh, mister Cortez, can we take the one that’s easiest to pronounce. Burritos?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Biarritz, mi comisionado,” the middle-aged man returned with a smile. She reminded him of his daughter, though he’d noticed that any little girl would remind him of his Isabella. He took a sun-baked and scar-ridden palm and pressed the map down into the seat between them until the creases were unmistakable from the leather surface. This was how he Isabella liked to play the capital game, that’s what she had called it. He made sure to hide his eyes underneath the shade of his cap as he did so. “I know it is hard to see the routes, but you can see the colour of the sea, yes?”

&amp;nbsp;

Ellie nodded.

&amp;nbsp;

“Good, we are going to go right along it, as close as we can to the sea without being on the beaches.” He stretched a thumb across his pointed chin and nestled his stubble in the groove between it and his index finger. “If we take the route along to Mimizan, we’ll likely run into no issues. The park at Gascogne would make a fine battliefield to rout the French threat.” It was the best he could do to put on a show. He couldn’t tell the Cookie Commissioner that he had already established a base at the beach in Biarritz.

&amp;nbsp;

Ellie, however, had been distracted by something that was not her own chin. Her fingers tapped the glossy screen of her smartphone, and after a few moments she chirped with all the assurance in the world filling her voice. “We can take the train from Burrito into Boredom! We’ll get to the beach in fifteen hours, look.” She pushed the device against General Cortez’s nose, and he blinked twice before shoving it away and apologising.

&amp;nbsp;

“Mi comisionado, my sincerest apologies, I cannot see up that close, but what you suggest I know is unworkable,” he raised an eyebrow like a caterpillar that someone had glued human hair too, “we cannot move our forces by public transportation.”

&amp;nbsp;

Ellie put her hands to her hips and scowled. “What? Why not?” She was very proud of her idea. “We just need to get everyone tickets and we’ll be okay.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Many logistical issues! Not to mention that French trains are criminally expensive, those frogs will milk our tax revenue at this rate. The soldiers will not stand for it, this I know.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Well they won’t have to stand, silly, there’ll be enough seats.” Ellie turned forward, as she noticed the Humvee’s chronic shaking had come to a stop, possibly cured by the salty sea breeze now blowing in from below them. There was not a single French soul on the beach, but there was an army of Spaniards who were unloading truckloads of tents, gear and Choco-Nutty cookies. “Oh wow, they sure move fast, we’d just decided to come to burrito. Your army is really efficient, mister Cortez.” Ellie marvelled at the evening tide mingling chilled purple and starlit orange with the golden grains of the shore. She had to bite her lip to stop herself from ordering a full-scale beach vacation. 

&amp;nbsp;

“The locals appear to have fled,” Cortez gazed on the squadron that had set up stacks of sandbags along the alleyways flanked by seaside hotels, “it is likely that the train station will not be manned, even.” He slapped a closed fist into the flat of his palm, adding another nail into Ellie’s entombed plan.

&amp;nbsp;

She pondered for a moment as the Humvee kicked up sand crawling down the roadside hill. Once it had sputtered to the beach, Ellie wasted no time in hopping out of the vehicle and ran to the nearest soldier. The man gave her the salute of the Eastern Coalition Forces, which was to hand them a cookie. “Mister Samuel! Mister Samuel! Uhh,” she cleared her throat and remembered the manners that Mrs. Hudson had once scolded her about, “ I hope you had a good drive over?”

&amp;nbsp;

Lieutenant Samuel stopped barking orders to his subordinates and told her about the cool drive and the several birds they had seen along the French coast.

&amp;nbsp;

 “Oh, that would definitely be good for your bird-spotting journal,” she added, and Samuel nodded, “if you aren’t busy, mister Samuel, can you ask miss Sofia to find mister Diego, he told me he used to work at a train station when he was in France.” Of course, Samuel would do this, but he could not help but ask for what purpose the Cookie Commissioner wanted the wisdom of a former train-station clerk. 
“Well we need to get everyone tickets for the train to Normandy, and mister Cortez said the local French people wouldn’t be here, so I was thinking to ask mister Diego.”

&amp;nbsp;

Lieutenant Samuel saw the wisdom of the small child for what it truly was and dropped everything his detachment was doing to seek out miss Sofia at the administrative camp. Ellie stood proudly over her work, arms folded over each other and covered in cookie crumbs, as General Cortez marched over and watched his men scatter like determined roaches across the beach. “We, we are moving the soldiers by train, aren’t we?” his voice was somewhat distant.

&amp;nbsp;

“I haven’t steered you wrong, mister Cortez!” Ellie turned and handed him a cookie. “Have I?” she asked with puppy eyes.

&amp;nbsp;

He had to admit, as he chewed on the delicate almond taste of the brick-baked dough, she was pretty good at guessing things. The Frenchies would never expect anyone actually using their trains.

8lutlk,0,2018-05-24,MAGIC Cast vs Cast Of Season 14,Jaleniskewl,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/8lutlk/magic_cast_vs_cast_of_season_14/,"Let’s talk about each cast. The similarities, the differences. Maybe we’ll get to the bottom of which is better!

MAGIC

Meredith, Alex, George, Izzie, Cristina, Burke, Derek, Webber and Miranda.

This was the OG cast. The five interns had dynamic and drama together. Izzie and George, Meredith and Cristina, with Alex in the middle. Each character had a different personality, but they all worked together to create a great cast. Each character interacted with another, and always had drama and things to talk about. They seemed like they actually cared about each-other. When one was down, they cared, they showed emotion.

Current (Season 14 including April and Arizona)

Owen, April, Maggie, Meredith, Amelia, Webber, Miranda, Arizona, Andrew, Jo Wilson, Alex and Jackson.

This cast is way bigger, and most don’t even interact with each other. However, those who are friends it is believe 
able, interesting and entertaining. They have more humour with each other, and they work together better. Some of the cast is married amongst themselves (Jolex) and that’s semi-well-done. Owen and Amelia’s baby story is interesting, and it leads to interesting moments. The continue to update and give new stories to most characters (other than Maggie) and the interns who are recurring, are actually likeable and funny for the most part.

Therefore, I think both casts are tied in an objective way, which there really isn’t an objective way. But personally, I will always prefer MAGIC but I also like the Season 14 cast.

8lutp9,2,2018-05-24,How to define what I do at my current job?,Susy_La_Adelita,ResumeHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ResumeHelp/comments/8lutp9/how_to_define_what_i_do_at_my_current_job/,"TL;DR: I don’t know how to define the work that I do (or even the position at work) for my resume. I tried to detail my job functions in the listed items below. I am looking to switch jobs so wanted your guys’ help.

Hello all. I don’t know if this is the place to ask so I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. I am basically looking to switch jobs and wanted to make myself more desirable to new software companies than I was when I graduated. I had a rough time finding jobs out of college since I didn’t have internships and therefore wanted advice on how to describe what I do in terms that a regular software company hiring manager might be able to judge my abilities.

I recently graduated from a university in the southeast US with my Electrical Engineering degree. I learned a lot of programming and did a bunch of projects ranging from embedded systems to android apps. I finally found a job at my current company but wanted to move to an actual software engineering company with better pay.

I currently work at a service company (tutoring company) that uses Google Sheets to manage all its information and run day-to-day business. I had been hired as the web designer since they wanted someone in house with web experience (that they didn’t need to pay as much). But I quickly moved over to general IT (as I want to call it). Basically, I introduced the idea of using Google Sheets to maintain and manage data and, using Google App Scripting, make the process as automated as possible. We already have a POS System from Square. But since our company is a service company and we feel Square isn’t really geared towards service companies yet, I had to find workarounds for a bunch of daily and monthly functions.
My basic functions are:

* Created and maintained an active daily appointment sheet using Google App Scripting with Google Sheets that pulls data from our POS system and is a dashboard for our admin staff to perform daily duties such as charge customers for appointments, verify all appointment details, measure complete employee hours and mark special transactions for future keeping (such as unpaid tickets, prepaid customers, etc.).

* Made a system for logging daily student attendance with digital signatures. I built a custom front-end to let tutors see only their respective students every day while all the data is managed through Google Sheets.

* Created a messaging system between tutors and students (and their families) using Google’s Gmail Service. Basically, the back-end is managed by Gmail and again Google Sheets while the front-end was built to have tutors send session notes to students through an app.

* As the web developer, I also improved the website with structural updates that had to do with the fact they were using a theme in WordPress before. I also do daily updates such as putting in new hires on the website and setting up online booking for appointments.

Since our client base is quite large (around 1500 customers), after I joined, I have been able to reduce a lot of man hours through automation (I understand I might have to give exact numbers on my resume).

I apologize for the long post. Please let me know if there is a better place to ask this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I want to go somewhere that might provide more structure and sophisticated tools and of course better pay. Thanks so much!"
8luvi7,149,2018-05-24,How I Became Known As Pizza Boy,cptmonty,IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/8luvi7/how_i_became_known_as_pizza_boy/,"This happened about 10 years ago.  I just found this subreddit and thought I would share this story.  

I work in the high tech industry and got my start through an internship that started in 2006 and turned into full-time position that I left in 2008.  Don't remember exactly when this happened but it was during the years mentioned above.

The office I worked was in a large neighborhood of other high tech companies with very few non-tech companies nearby.  However, across the street, there was a little strip mall with some restaurants, including a Round Table Pizza.  Employees would often order pizzas for delivery from this Round Table.  For larger orders, the delivery person would drive the delivery truck across the street and park in our visitor lot in front of the lobby.  

One afternoon, while I was in the lobby, another employee approached me and our conversation went like this:

Employee: Hey! You need to move your truck.

Me: Sorry. What?

Employee: I said you need to move your truck.  You're double parked and blocking me in.

Me: I don't own a truck...

Employee: *points outside to Round Table truck* That's your truck.  You need to move it! You can't park wherever you want!

Me: I work here. I'm not the pizza delivery person.  

Employee: Well, where's the pizza person?  They need to move the truck!

Me: OK...

During this conversation, the pizza person returned to their truck and left.  I wasn't sure what else to say, so I went back to my desk.  The event was so strange that I had to tell my coworkers. My manager thought this was hilarious and started calling me Pizza Boy.  

Fast forward to 2016 and I'm the market for a new job.  I was eventually hired by a former coworker from the company where the pizza incident went down.  After a starting, it was revealed to me that my resume was almost passed because of the Pizza Boy name. The manager that gave me the name has a bit of a reputation for being too silly at work and a bit of a chauvinist. The hiring manager remembered these things and was a worried that I would be similar.  I got the job, so its no problem but now word has spread around that my nickname is Pizza Boy. "

During this time of the year, the company hires interns to help out and train.

I was hired at the ALL TAX, a firm known for accounting and I was only in college sophomore year. They liked my marks and my attitude. I am sure that they only hired me because I was black. Traditionally, the company hired only college juniors. 

My first day in the office involved mainly HR and training. I hadn’t met my boss before, because I interviewed at another office and HR switched me to this location to help out with the workload.

Around 9a next morning, I met with my boss and had small meet and greet. From that point on it was smooth sailing. I caught on how to do my tasks and was adjusting fairly well. One thing that did distract me was my boss. She was a MILF and someone who loved big ass, she was perfect. We casually flirted with every change we got. 


After my first month and a half, I was asked to stay back later with my boss to work on a special project. Most of the partners would leave around 7, managers around 8 or so, but she told me I need to work until at least 9 at night. Of course I eagerly agreed, excited to be on an important client."

The voice of Hillary's Ads and Her Bio, Morgan Freeman is Accused of Sexual Harassment.",BrutalTruth101,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8lvz7k/trump_curse_the_voice_of_hillarys_ads_and_her_bio/,"Women accuse Morgan Freeman of inappropriate behavior, harassment
An Phung and Chloe Melas

(CNN)A young production assistant thought she had landed the job of her dreams when, in the summer of 2015, she started work on ""Going In Style,"" a bank heist comedy starring Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Alan Arkin.

But the job quickly devolved into several months of harassment, she told CNN. She alleges that Freeman subjected her to unwanted touching and comments about her figure and clothing on a near-daily basis. Freeman would rest his hand on her lower back or rub her lower back, she said.
In one incident, she said, Freeman ""kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear."" He never successfully lifted her skirt, she said -- he would touch it and try to lift it, she would move away, and then he'd try again. Eventually, she said, ""Alan [Arkin] made a comment telling him to stop. Morgan got freaked out and didn't know what to say.""

Freeman's alleged inappropriate behavior was not limited to that one movie set, according to other sources who spoke to CNN. A woman who was a senior member of the production staff of the movie ""Now You See Me"" in 2012 told CNN that Freeman sexually harassed her and her female assistant on numerous occasions by making comments about their bodies.

""He did comment on our bodies... We knew that if he was coming by ... not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms, meaning not wearing clothes that [were] fitted,"" she said.

At 80 years old, Freeman is one of Hollywood's biggest stars, with a movie career that spans nearly five decades. His starring roles in movies like ""Driving Miss Daisy"" and ""Shawshank Redemption"" in the late 1980s and early 1990s made him a household name. He won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for 2004's ""Million Dollar Baby,"" and has earned four other Oscar nominations. His voiceover work has also become iconic, including his narration for the Academy Award-winning documentaries ""The Long Way Home"" and ""March of the Penguins.""

In all, 16 people spoke to CNN about Freeman as part of this investigation, eight of whom said they were victims of what some called harassment and others called inappropriate behavior by Freeman. Eight said they witnessed Freeman's alleged conduct. These 16 people together described a pattern of inappropriate behavior by Freeman on set, while promoting his movies and at his production company Revelations Entertainment.

Of those 16, seven people described an environment at Revelations Entertainment that included allegations of harassment or inappropriate behavior by Freeman there, with one incident allegedly witnessed by Lori McCreary, Freeman's co-founder in the enterprise, and another in which she was the target of demeaning comments by Freeman in a public setting. One of those seven people alleged that McCreary made a discriminatory remark regarding a female candidate for a job at the Producers Guild of America, where McCreary is co-president.

Four people who worked in production capacities on movie sets with Freeman over the last ten years described him as repeatedly behaving in ways that made women feel uncomfortable at work. Two, including the production assistant on ""Going in Style"" whose skirt he allegedly attempted to lift, said Freeman subjected them to unwanted touching. Three said he made public comments about women's clothing or bodies. But each of them said they didn't report Freeman's behavior, with most saying it was because they feared for their jobs. Instead, some of the women -- both on movie sets and at Revelations -- said, they came up with ways to combat the alleged harassment on their own, such as by changing the way they dressed when they knew he would be around.

CNN reached out to dozens more people who worked for or with Freeman. Some praised Freeman, saying they never witnessed any questionable behavior or that he was a consummate professional on set and in the office.

Several other times during this investigation, when a CNN reporter contacted a person who had worked with Freeman to try to ask them if they had seen or been subjected to inappropriate behavior by an actor they had worked with -- not initially even naming the actor they were asking about -- the person would immediately tell them they knew exactly who the reporter had in mind: Morgan Freeman. Some of those people were sources for this investigation while others declined to comment further or did not want what they said used in this story.

The pattern of behavior described by those who spoke with CNN shows another example of the systematic problems that exist in the entertainment industry. The allegations against Freeman are not about things that happened in private; they are about things that allegedly happened in public, in front of witnesses -- even in front of cameras. Before #MeToo, many men in the industry could behave without fear of consequences, because many times when a powerful man did so, it was the victim who suffered repercussions.

CNN reached out to Freeman's spokesperson for comment and then, at his request, emailed him a detailed list of the accusations against Freeman. The spokesperson did not respond to multiple follow-ups by email seeking comment on the accusations. After this article was published, Freeman released a statement in which he said, ""Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy. I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected — that was never my intent.""

CNN also reached out to a spokesperson for McCreary, and then provided her with a detailed list of accusations regarding Freeman's alleged behavior at Revelations and details of the accusation against her as well as a number of questions for her regarding Freeman's alleged behavior at Revelations and the environment there. The spokesperson did not respond to multiple follow-ups by email seeking comment.

The allegations of inappropriate behavior by Freeman are not limited to the confines of his company or to movie sets. Three entertainment reporters who spoke to CNN said Freeman made inappropriate remarks to them during press junkets, which are publicity events for journalists who cover new films, typically attended by the movie's biggest stars.
One of the three, CNN entertainment reporter Chloe Melas, the co-author of this article, says she was subjected to inappropriate behavior by Freeman more than a year ago, when she interviewed him at a press junket for ""Going in Style."" According to Melas, who was six months pregnant at the time, Freeman, in a room full of people, including his co-stars Arkin and Caine, shook Melas' hand, not letting go while repeatedly looking her up and down and saying more than once a variation of, ""I wish I was there."" She says he also said to her, ""You are ripe."" Cameras were on and recording during one of Freeman's remarks to Melas -- ""Boy, do I wish I was there"" -- but not for the rest. As is common practice with such junkets, Melas was the only CNN employee there at the time.

Afterward, Melas reported what had happened to her supervisor, who instructed her to inform CNN human resources. According to Melas, she was told that CNN HR contacted their counterparts at human resources for Warner Bros., which produced and distributed the movie, and which like CNN is owned by Time Warner. Melas said she was also told that Warner Bros. HR could not corroborate the account because only one of Freeman's remarks was on video and the Warner Bros. employees present did not notice anything. Melas and her supervisor agreed that she would not cover the movie.
Asked for comment, a spokesperson for Warner Bros. confirmed that what Melas was told was accurate, but declined to comment further. A representative for Caine declined to comment. A representative for Arkin said he was not available for comment.

After the encounter with Freeman, Melas started making calls to see if other women had experienced anything similar, or whether this was an isolated incident. She soon learned that other women had similar stories -- and so she, and later her co-author, began this months-long reporting process.
Inside Revelations Entertainment

Freeman and Lori McCreary founded Revelations Entertainment in 1996. Variety reported last year that Freeman started the company with McCreary because he was frustrated by the lack of choice roles for black actors and because he wanted to reveal the truth about serious issues -- a mission that inspired the name ""Revelations.""

The company's credits include a list of ambitious films about religion, apartheid, astronomy and stem cell research. Revelations also produced the film ""Along Came a Spider"" and the hit CBS show ""Madam Secretary,"" both of which feature strong female leads.

But former staffers who spoke with CNN say that behind the façade of a progressive and artistic agenda the company's two founders created what one called a ""toxic"" work environment. Six former staffers said they witnessed Freeman's questionable behavior around women, which they said included sexual comments and one said included an incident of unsolicited touching. One female former staffer said she was the target of sexual comments by Freeman.

The female former employee at Revelations told CNN that Freeman was flanked by a group of men on the set of ""Through the Wormhole"" when she met the actor for the first time. He ""looked me up and down,"" she said, and then asked her, ""How do you feel about sexual harassment?""

""I was stunned,"" she told CNN. ""This is the person that I worked for, this is his company, I didn't expect it at all ... I said timidly, 'I love it' in a sarcastic way hoping to make light of the situation because I was so confused and then he turned to the guys on the crew ... and said, 'See guys, this is how you do it.'""

One woman who was a manager at Revelations told CNN that sometimes Freeman would ""come over to my desk to say hi and he'd just stand there and stare at me. He would stare at my breasts.""

""If I ever passed him he would stare at me in an awkward way, would look me up and down sometimes stopping and just staring,"" she said. ""One time he stopped, looked me up and down as I walked into a room of people, and everyone burst out laughing. And I literally froze feeling very uncomfortable and one of the people in the office said, 'Don't worry, that's just Morgan.'""

""That sort of interaction was when I stopped wearing a skirt around the office when he was there,"" said the former manager. ""I can't say it was an accident that I'd be wearing a potato sack and a ponytail on certain days when he was there and do my best to avoid him when he was in the office.""

Freeman was not in the office on a daily basis, the former employees said. But when he did show up, he behaved like a ""creepy uncle,"" in the words of a male former employee. ""One time I witnessed Morgan walk up to an intern and start massaging her"" shoulder, he said. ""The intern got visibly red and wiggled out of his grasp, it was awkward."" The incident stood out to him because Freeman was using only one hand to touch the intern, as his other was injured in a 2008 car accident that was widely covered by the press. Another former employee told CNN she was present when the male former employee told several people about this incident shortly after it occurred.

CNN spoke to two male witnesses who each saw a separate occasion in which Freeman asked women to twirl. One instance occurred at the office, while another happened at an off-site company event.
Another incident stood out to people who spoke with CNN who witnessed it. Two former staffers who were there, and a writer for the show ""Madam Secretary"" who also attended, each described the scene to CNN.

For his 79th birthday, Revelations threw Freeman a party in the office. According to the sources, roughly 30 people attended the party, some of whom were new to the company and had never met the actor. McCreary was among those in attendance, the sources said.

People at the party had to stand in a circle, a former executive at the company who attended the party told CNN, and tell Freeman who they were and what they did. Then, the former executive said, Freeman went up to women in the circle and would ""stand maybe within an inch of their face and just look them up and down and not say anything, and then would move on to the next woman and he'd stand like within an inch of their face and look them up and down and not say anything, and it was really, really strange."" The former executive added, ""It was really weird and he did it to every woman but of course he didn't do it to any of the men. He didn't speak to any of the men.""

The writer for ""Madam Secretary"" who was at the party said, ""We saw Morgan go around to the girls in the circle and get really close to their faces, he didn't do it to the men. I don't know what he said but we all thought it was strange and couldn't wait to get the hell out of there. Absolutely there were sexual undertones to it."" After the #MeToo movement began, the same writer said, writers on the show joked -- with that incident in mind -- ""that Morgan would be the next person to be called out.""
McCreary herself has also been the subject of demeaning comments by Freeman. In front of what was reportedly an audience of 400 people at 2016's Produced By conference, Freeman described what she was wearing during their first meeting, saying, ""She had on a dress cut to here.""

""She wants to be thought of as serious,"" said Freeman of McCreary, who was on the same panel. ""But you can't get away from the short dresses.""

Freeman stood by his comments when he appeared a few days later on the ""Today"" show and host Savannah Guthrie said some people were ""surprised"" by the remarks he made on the panel.
""It was just something I said in jest about when I first met her, it was more than 20 years ago,"" he said to Guthrie. ""How is that news?""

The Hollywood Reporter reported at the time that McCreary ""did not visibly react to the comment."" One of the former Revelations executives told CNN that McCreary was visibly upset when she returned to the office.

""I tried to console her and she was clearly upset and I think she was surprised and found it hurtful and embarrassing,"" said the former executive. ""She was devastated.""
We knew that if he was coming by ... not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms.

A senior member of the production staff for the movie ""Now You See Me""

Five sources told CNN that there was no formal human resources department at Revelations at the time. There was a rotation of executives who served as the point of contact for HR issues, but former staffers said they did not feel comfortable talking to senior personnel about their workplace grievances. This prompted some staffers to form a ""survivors club"" where they gathered to vent about their experiences at Revelations, according to five sources who have been to the gatherings, which take place outside of the office.

Publicly, McCreary champions the #MeToo and Time's Up movements. Two days before January's Screen Actors Guild awards, at which Freeman accepted a Lifetime Achievement Award, McCreary released a statement on behalf of the Producers Guild of America (PGA), to say that its board ratified new anti-sexual harassment guidelines for its members. ""The PGA is indebted to Time's Up as a resource in creating our protocols,"" she said in a press release issued with her co-president Gary Lucchesi, referring to the initiative aimed at fighting harassment and discrimination against women.

Yet the former Revelations employee who said Freeman asked her how she felt about sexual harassment also alleged that on a phone call with a member of PGA, McCreary said of a candidate vying for a position at PGA East, ""she'll never be able to do a good job, she has a family.""

Two former senior level Revelations employees said McCreary would openly mock women who had to leave work early for family commitments and school functions. McCreary also allegedly said that some employees couldn't handle big workloads because they had to ""run home"" to their families and therefore couldn't stay late at work, according to one of the sources. She openly advocated for work-life balance, that source said, but she would make ""snide"" remarks to those who left work early.
A spokesperson for the PGA said in a statement, ""The Producers Guild of America is an Equal Opportunity Employer that does not question or consider marital or parental status in its hiring practices. As soon as CNN notified us about the allegation, we investigated the matter and have found that it has no merit. Lori McCreary is an outstanding PGA President. In all of her work with the Guild, she has been a consistent, vocal, and proactive advocate for women and all who are underrepresented in our community.""

A spokesperson for McCreary did not respond to repeated follow-up requests for comment regarding the allegations against McCreary.

On set
One of the former male Revelations employees recounted to CNN what he called the ""shocking"" remarks that Freeman made while he was on set for a number of Freeman's movies. What he says he witnessed follows the pattern described by the women who said they were harassed by Freeman.

""[He'd say] things like 'I'd like to have an hour with her' or make vulgar and sexual comments about women,"" the former employee said. ""He would be verbally inappropriate and it was just shocking. You're more shocked than anything because it's hard to have the wherewithal to say to him 'That's inappropriate.' You're just like 'whoa.' It's hard because on any set he is the most powerful person on it. It's weird because you just don't expect it from Morgan Freeman, someone who you respect.""

Morgan Freeman at an event in California in 2016.
The female production assistant (PA) mentioned at the beginning of this story who worked on ""Going In Style"" said she was in her early 20s when Freeman, then 78 years old, harassed her. She said the experience led to her decision to leave the movie industry.
""It was constant comments about the way I looked,"" she said, adding that Freeman often made the comments within earshot of others on the production staff. She said she frequently came home from work in tears.

The woman recalled a time when she went to the set wearing a dress with a t-shirt over it to cover her exposed back, but ""Morgan said to me that I shouldn't be wearing the shirt over my dress.""
Another female production assistant who witnessed this particular alleged incident told CNN that Freeman's behavior towards the younger female production staff was an unchecked and persistent issue during filming. Both women said the t-shirt incident took place in front of a group of people and that they heard at least one other woman publicly chastise Freeman for that particular comment. The behavior was discussed among the women he targeted, the female production assistant said.
A third woman who worked on a recent movie of Freeman's recalled an incident at the film's wrap party. ""He was looking at my breasts, and I told him, 'My eyes are up here.' Then we went to take a group photo and he pressed himself up against me. It was inappropriate.""

CNN spoke to one of the woman's colleagues on the film, who said that as soon as the photo was taken, the woman walked over and told a group of people what Freeman had done to her.

[W]e all joked that Morgan would be the next person to be called out in this #MeToo movement.

Another production assistant, who worked with Freeman on ""The Dark Knight,"" told CNN that although she was never personally targeted by Freeman, she witnessed some inappropriate comments Freeman made to female members of the crew. She also said that female members of the crew would at times discuss how Freeman had made them feel uncomfortable.

""Morgan did things in a way that an older more established person can get away with because they have that power,"" she told CNN. ""They can't be replaced, but you can be replaced very easily, that's just kind of the dynamic on set. PA's can be replaced, grips can be replaced, electricians can be replaced, but the actors -- once they're in, they're in. Had it been somebody else on the crew... I would feel comfortable reporting them because I wouldn't feel like my job would be in danger by reporting them, but if you report somebody like Morgan Freeman that the movie would lose a lot of money by replacing them or getting them in trouble, then you're the trouble maker and you'll get fired because you're just a PA.""

Freeman's alleged fixation on how women dressed was apparent when he hit the road to promote his films, as was his alleged pattern of looking women up and down while making sexually suggestive comments to them.

As the entertainment producer at Chicago's WGN-TV, Tyra Martin spent hours interviewing Freeman at various press junkets. Over the course of a decade, she said, she sat down with him at least nine times and grew accustomed to his comments about her appearance. But Martin made it clear in an interview with CNN that she was always ""in on the joke."" WGN produced videos featuring some of Freeman's remarks to Martin, describing it as him flirting with her. But Martin felt that one incident crossed a line.

""When I stood up, I pulled my skirt part of my dress down and he did say, 'Oh, don't pull it down now.'"" Martin said. ""That gave me pause but I never felt uncomfortable.""
It is unclear whether video of that incident exists.

An entertainment reporter who is a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association said Freeman made comments about her skirt and her legs during two different junkets. Much like many of the women in this report and those who declined to go on the record, the reporter said Freeman's fame and power kept her from speaking out.

""I was just trying to do my job and I brushed it off,"" said the reporter, who did not want to be identified for this story because she's fearful of losing out on interviews with other celebrities.
""You don't want to put him on the spot because one, he's famous and two, it's on camera and three, you just want to do your job."""

I am an adult lookin for adults for a story that is purely fantasy.  
    
  
I am going to try to set the scene first, if you just want to see the idea for the prompt skip to the end. 
  

A couple moved in next door to me a few weeks ago. I’m staying in my parents friends house, they decided to move overseas for a sabbatical year, and had generously offered me their home, on condition I looked after it. They were both professors at the college I was going to, do it worked out. They got someone to watch the house, and I got to live privately right off campus.  

Back to the couple. He looked to be around 55. A handsome gentleman, looked like he worked in banking, power suit and a silver head of hair. She, on the other hand, looked to be around 40. [Blonde, with a perfect hourglass figure](https://i.redd.it/inp78euigbcz.jpg), she was the type of woman any young man would give their left hand to have as a neighbor. I say left hand, because they would want the right hand if you know what I mean. 


I didn’t have much to do with them the first week, beyond going over to welcome them and introduce myself. The husband seemed nice enough, if not a little preoccupied, and the wife was very bubbly and sweet. I did notice that she was in fantastic shape for her age, but I did catch a glimpse of a private gym in the house so that accounted for her body. 

I left them my number with the offer to call if they needed anything, and I didn’t hear from them for two weeks. One morning, on a Sunday, she called me up to ask me to help set up her wifi. She explained that her husband was at work, being a workaholic, and I was happy to help. That was when I first realized she was a bit dim. The only problem with the WiFi was it was unplugged, but she didn’t seem to understand that. She also had me fix a faucet, which was only not working because she was trying to turn the knob the wrong way. 


Oh, and did I mention [what she was wearing when I got there?](https://i.imgur.com/QITRGrV.jpg). I was happy to help, and quickly did what she needed, before chatting for a few minutes. I didn’t really pay attention, [for obvious reasons](https://i.redd.it/m8m86q5gpfw01.png). But as she droned on, and I eagerly watched and waited for her tits to slip out, I did hear a bit. She mentioned how her husband didn’t let her go to his office anymore, because she would always end up talking to the interns, and once she even let them slap her ass, but just to prove it was real. She explained how at first her husband was upset, but he wasn’t angry after she told him she did it to prove to the interns that their boss had a real wife, not a plastic one. 



After we finished chatting, I went back home, but my mind was filled with ideas. 

**end of scene**


So, if it’s not abundantly clear from the setting, I’m looking for a woman who wants to play a bimbo. Not a cock hungry whore, but rather a really sweet, innocent, and gullible woman. I’ll be the young neighbor who slowly starts to take advantage of her, first in small ways, like convincing her to model her bikinis for me, or even lingerie. But we’ll slowly take it further and further, maybe even involving her husband. Perhaps they are trying to conceive, and I explain that I know the best position to impregnate a woman, but I have to demonstrate it on her. 

I think you get it. My kinks are bimbos, big tits, outfits, naive women, oily sex, public sex, exhibition, anal, eating pussy/ass, cheating, cuckolding, and much much more. I can’t wait for some envelopes.

8lwoq1,17,2018-05-24,Undergrad EE/CE students needed for new student organization,sfsdfd,gmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/gmu/comments/8lwoq1/undergrad_eece_students_needed_for_new_student/,"I’ve been studying engineering at GMU for several years. Easily the biggest complaints I’ve heard and read - and what I’ve felt as well - are:

(1) “I feel like I know all this stuff, but I don’t know how to apply it. I’m worried about applying for an internship without any actual experience / I’m worried about getting an internship and then feeling like I’m in way over my head.”

(2) “I signed up in engineering to make and build robots and computers and stuff, but we never do any of that.”

Computer science students don’t have those complaints. Okay, that’s partly because it’s easier to start banging out Python or HTML as a casual project than to bust out a soldering iron and start soldering stuff together. But it’s also partly because CS students have SRCT, which does a great job of helping CS students dabble in hobbyist code, share knowledge, and contribute to interesting projects. EE/CE has nothing.

We need to change that. And by “we,” I mean: undergrad engineering students. It’s time we try to make something happen.

I’m interested in starting up a student group in the fall that’s an engineering equivalent to SRCT: a group that meets weekly or biweekly to tinker with electronics, tear things apart and see how they work, share knowledge, and talk about the practice of engineering.

This will take a team effort and some planning over the summer, especially from more advanced undergrad students who have a bit of time, skill, and an itch to start something new at Volgenau. If you’re interested, please post here or message me."
8lwsdj,1,2018-05-24,Cycle Status- Please Share Advice,fridgefriend,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/8lwsdj/cycle_status_please_share_advice/,"Hi guys, I was hoping for some advice on my options moving forward. Been one year out of college (UNC) and would prefer to go this upcoming year if possible. However, am considering waiting another year if it can yield significantly better prospects but like I said would like to go this year if possible. Goals aren't fully defined but big law is the target or one of those unicorn boutique law firms which pay decently and don't suck your time and soul out like big law. Location wise I want to practice is DC, open to option elsewhere but have a strong preference for DC. I'm pretty debt averse, ie would like to minimize it as much as possible but with the understanding I will still need to take out a lot of loans to get through law school. For most of my viable options I'm looking at at least $75,000 in debt at the end of it all. For reference my stats are (3.31/167) and for cost purposes I am considering living at home (Alexandria, Northern Virginia) which would make it possible for me to commute to DC/NOVA if applicable to save money. I sent all my apps in around Mid-February so they were quite late. However, I'm not sure if applying early next cycle would make much of a difference in the places I got into. Maybe might increase aid in some places but I can't take anything for granted. For a possible retake, if I wait a cycle I wouldn't mind retaking. But I've been working now for 3 months on a full time schedule which was not the case the first two times I took it where LSAT was basically the only thing I had to focus on. It's also been 5 months since I've looked at any LSAT material so it won't be easy to just get back into it. Basically my point is that I don't want to assume that if I wait a cycle and retake that I'll improve, in fact that would be a pretty long shot. 166 was my average during my LSAT training and that was in my prime study stage. Even back then I only hit 170 once so as much as I would love to tell myself I can retake and hit 170 it's not very realistic. For waiting a year, I want to assume that my stats remain the same and see what you guys think I can hit based on that plus apps sent in September/October.


Here's a recap of schools I applied to and my result:


Rejected from: (Duke, Michigan, Georgetown, USC)


Waitlisted: (Notre Dame, Boston University)


Waiting for: (Vanderbilt)


Accepted: (UNC $$, Florida State $, GMU $$$, William and Mary $$$,Washington and Lee $$, George Washington $$). 


Once again, remember that I applied late in the cycle for each of these.
 

Here are my top 3 prospects for this fall that I am considering in order. (GW most tempting... etc)


•	George Washington Law- It is ranked just within the top 25 and has the added boost of being in DC which could be a big plus in terms on the networking, internship, and clinic opportunities. However tuition at GW is very high so even if I save money by living at home, with their $40,000 per year scholarship offer, I'm still looking at at least $30,000 in loans for each of the three years. This is assuming I commute from home which isn't terribly exciting but doesn't make financial sense not to do.


•	Washington and Lee University:  W&amp;L is ranked decently as well, just outside of the top 25. Their scholarship offer is $40,000 per year which subtracted from the total cost of everything would leave me needing $25,000-$30,000 in loans per year there. W&amp;L is known for its loyal alumni network which is always important, however being in such a rural area the university doesn't have some of the connections and convenient opportunities that a school like GW would. Still it is a good option. And a slightly cheaper one. 


•	George Mason Law: Also known as the Anthony Scalia School of Law. Located in Arlington it heavily sells itself as being on the doorstep of DC, which admittedly is an advantage.  Though they don't quite have the access or clout as someone like a GW in the area. They are ranked lower than the other two schools but within the top 50 at least. Getting a big law job will require a lot of work in networking and distinguishing myself at law school and doing really well to get a chance at the comparatively limited big law opportunities. The upside for this option is that they are offering close to full tuition scholarship (it's an instate school so tuition isn't as high anyway). That would mean ""only"" $12,000 a year (assuming I live at home) in loans which is why it's still definitely in my consideration. 



Any and all advice on my current prospects and applying this year vs next overall is much appreciated. Thank you.

8lwyfu,1,2018-05-24,Relationship Advice. How to deal with post episode guilt and supporting your sO,IndependentInterview,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/8lwyfu/relationship_advice_how_to_deal_with_post_episode/,"Hi there. I am in my young 20's and was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 a bit more than a year ago. At first, I was a trainwreck. I had a hard time accepting it, and it made me question myself and life actions a lot and I had a super shitty doctor that just gave me high doses of medications which had horrible side effects that took me to very dark places. I don't want to extend myself much but by now I feel I can get a good handle of my life. I am able to go to school, work, excerice, go out etc etc. I do get some moments where I wont like to be as social, and want to sleep all day and I am overly emotional and cry and stuff, and days where I am hyper and outgoing and talk a lot, and days where I will pick up a fight for anything. We all know how this is. but overall, things do not go out of proportion how it used to and I am able to be aware of when it is coming and when I am in those  mood swings. I have been dating a guy for almost 6 months. He is extremely patient and kind and we have a lot of fun together. We have similar likes and interests and we are both on the same page as in what we want for our relationship and out steps in making sure we have good careers both as we finish college. 

I am currently in another state due to a summer internship and he is back in my home  state. These last two weeks we have been arguing a lot. I feel I have been very very grumpy and snapy and in one of those fights we both even broke up and said some pretty hurtful things. We recovered and these two days I have been good. However, last night he mentioned he had gone on a fb meme group and posted that we wanted help dealing with bipolar. This really upset me. I am actually still very mad about it and he insists he didnt do anything wrong. He then said this meme group was a closed group and that everyone usually posts about their issues there. He posted it in a way where it seems he is the one who was bipolar sekeing for help. Regardless. I told him what uspet me is that he didnt talk about it with me before. I have a really hard time right now with accepting this disease as part of my life. I have been feeling very ashamed lately and super guilty after the stupid fights I come up with during one of my episodes. I also feel guilty we could have had a nice skype talk rather than me crying in the camera for two hours. I feel bad and ashamed. I have no problem with him talking to his friends for advice. I just really am upset that he didnt bring it up to me first, that he was going to post in a non anonymous group about it, and then discuss it in private message with one of his friends which I have recently met. I have nothing against her, she actually gave him some good advice, but its just the fact that he doestn see that this is not his secret to spill. It is very personal to me and I should be the one who decides who to share it with. I am still very upset and he says that I am being unreasonable and that he didnt do anything wrong. I told him I was done and that we were done. I was very mad, I dont think I mean that. I am just very frustrated that he didnt consider what talking about this to other people means to me. And I feel like he still does not get it. He thinks I am trying to tell him that he is like not allowed to vent with his friends and that is 100% not what I mean. I understand it must be frustrating to him and he also has to deal with me having bipolar, so I understand why he did what he did. but I am still upset that he didnt directly said something like ""Hey I really want to help but idk how, I want ot talk to other SOs that are in my shoes"". Jsut like, discuss it with me first you know? Because ti is my disease, its my thing, at least like keep me in the loop. idk..idk if you guys can understand what I mean. I just feel very upset about this whole thing, and I feel so weird and ashamed that others are just discussing my disease behind my back because it is a very personal thing imo.

What do I do? I obviously don't want to break up with him he is very supportive and I know he is seeking for help because he cares. I am scared I just don't know how to help him help me. I am worried this will just make us fight all the time and we are apart, and we will be in the same situation of being in tow different states for a whole year next year, so what do I do? How do I keep my relationship afloat and not let my bipolar drown it into arguments and me being temperamental and snapy and mean.

I currently do not take medication but I am trying to set up an appt with a psych to start because I feel I have done as much as I could without it and there are just things that meditation and regular sleep et etc won't help fixing."
8lx73x,4,2018-05-24,A weird story about a christian internship.,JTitor5100,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/8lx73x/a_weird_story_about_a_christian_internship/,"A few years ago I took an internship at a self proclaimed 'Christian' law firm in the bible belt.  I am an atheist, but I figured that I could deal with the environment since I assumed that they simply avoided taking cases that didn't mesh with their christian values.  I was looking to get into law school and this internship looked like a good thing to put on an application.  I was very wrong about what this internship would be like.  Half of the interns were high school students and it felt more like a church summer camp than a legal internship.  I wasn't learning anything about the law, but I was determined to see the internship through to the end as I figured being able to cite an internship at a law firm would help me get into law school.  The whole internship was pretty weird, but one of the craziest things I heard was when I was grabbing lunch with one of the girls at the internship.  She mentioned that she wanted to get a scripture tattooed into her, but she was worried that if an atheist saw it they may try to carve it off with a knife.  I let her know that I was an atheist and I had no problem with her getting whatever tattoo she wants.  She didn't seem aware that just because people don't believe in god doesn't mean that they actively hate religious people.  It just kind of threw me off because I grew up religious, but I never was frightened of violent atheists.  It just seems like a weird stereotype.  "

I'm back (and okay, since my last post was a bit dramatic). The Keeper still has not calmed herself despite all the serious health issues and keeps downplaying things because, apparently, at 21 I'm overreacting if I mention pain, while my brother mentioning he feels overtired has her up in a tizzy. Anyways...

Last night, her boyfriend and I had a serious conversation about the internship. He was lining it up for me with the wife of a work friend as a favor. He asked me if I was going to be serious about it, since I've made it clear I want to be back with SO, along with my health issues, as he was taking a chance on me. We agreed to wait until after my upcoming doctor's appointments and see what needs to happen next before I give him an answer.

Now, mind you, SO predicted that the whole reason they got me this organized as a way to just,,, keep me busy because the past 3 summers, I've been unable to get a summer job. I brushed it off in hopes that it was actually just TK being decent for once.

Well, today it came out. I mentioned in passing my conversation with her BF. She didn't seem too happy with this, as she seems to think my entire health issues are purely in my head, replying ""if you don't do that, you'll have to find something else to do, because I don't want you in the house all day."" As if I don't do anything when I'm at her house. I cook, I generally at least help with cleaning, and I do my own laundry, as well as anything she asks me to do (because otherwise I get another lecture about how her parents never had to lift a finger when she came home - whatever.) 

I almost told her right there that if I didn't do the internship, I was returning to SO by July. If I'm gonna be job hunting, I'm going to do it in a place I can move from temp to full time once I graduate. But I didn't feel like fighting so I bit my tongue.

This certainly isn't her worst episode, but it's just frustrating. I've been so goddamn tired lately and I left school because the pain was so bad, I couldn't handle it in class or at work. Ugh, I just want to be taken seriously for once in my life, for fuck's sake."

As a result, I will be moving in with my Dad full time. My parents have been divorced since I was 13, and I have swapped houses weekly since then. 

My relationship with my Mom has been strained for the past couple of years, as I have often been her sole emotional support as she dealt with mental health issues and severe fallout from a failed relationship. While I support her in wanting to better her career and make positive changes in her life, I worry that her moving could have adverse effects. She hasn't even moved and is already dropping hints and suggesting places that I could work in the area that's she moving to. I go to college in my home town, and have a year left until graduation. The majority of my family, and my significant other live here. And I have an internship that I hope to turn into a career. In short, I have no intentions of moving, but fear that her desire to have me close by will eventually become a point of contention. 

I have a great relationship with my Dad, and thankfully he doesn't mind me bringing my dog along with me at all. However, we haven't lived together in a full time capacity since I was 13. I have always been able to escape to one house or the other when I needed space from one parent.  I expect this may cause some issues as we both transition to a new normal. 

What can I do to make this transition as painless as possible for all parties? 

How can I best prepare myself for this transition?

8lxrg4,259,2018-05-24,First day on the job: I was Kevin,ash_274,StoriesAboutKevin,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/8lxrg4/first_day_on_the_job_i_was_kevin/,"I was a video/film major in college.  I did great in my related classes and one of my projects was even nominated for a ^((regional)) Emmy.  I had impressed my professors enough that they had submitted my name to a internship program with a broadcast network that's part of my state's collegiate system, but I had forgotten they they even asked me if I wanted to do it.  I certainly did, but as the timing of the classes and internship were, I had completed all my video editing classes three months before the internship began.  So after over a year of spending 6-7 days a week in editing bays and studios &amp; sets, I had moved on to a stack of *non-video classes* like Geology, Calculus, and three other classes.  The mechanics of the software/hardware we used was a perishable skill, as I soon found out.

I get to the studio and the lead editor (my boss for the internship) showed me the bays and gave me my login credentials and the general do's and don'ts and handed me some raw footage and a editing script and told me to cut it together so it can be broadcast the next day and he leaves for his office.  I sit down and suddenly I realize that I still knew *what* I needed to do, but I couldn't remember *how* to make that happen.  I digitized the tapes because I remember that step, but I couldn't do even the simplest thing in the software because I had forgotten the keyboard commands (this editing software is 99.99% keyboard based, which in practice is much faster than using the mouse).

So I go to my boss' office and knock and stick my head in and ask, ""could you show me how to move a clip in the timeline?""  He stares at me thinking a punchline is coming and when one clearly isn't he face went white.  Without getting technical, this was the equivalent question in other professions: 

|Profession|Kevinish question
|-|-
|Surgeon|""The liver that we're working on today... that's in the ""tummy"" area, right?""
|Pilot, while parked at the gate|""So, how do we get this thing up in the air?""
|Railroad engineer|""Wait, how do I steer this?""

He took me back to the editing bay and showed be the right keys to use to move the clip.  He didn't make any other comments and went back to his office.  I think I heard him hit his head on his desk.  I'm moving clips and putting the video package together and I F up and now I'm getting the audio and video out of sync because I accidentally hit the key that separates them from each other.  I go back to the boss and tell him what I did wrong and he showed me what I did and how to fix it.

He's stuck with me for the next 10 weeks.  The paperwork process for the internship system means that he *could* get rid of me immediately, but he couldn't get a replacement student until the next quarter, so he would have to do my workload as well has his own.  After the second time needing his help, I knew I heard him pound his head on his desk.

The rest of the day went without incident and by the third day I was back to my regular speed.  By the end of the program I had become one of his fastest and hands-off students he had ever had in six years of running the program.  He could hand me a week's worth of assignments on Monday and they would all be ready for broadcast by Wednesday or Thursday, so I could watch *him* work on the more technical stuff the rest of the week and get hours in on the Bugatti-priced editing suite that most of the graduate students could only dream of using someday.  I also did a bunch of other nightmarishly-boring scut work that most students would either not do or complain about too much.  I had impressed my boss enough that when the term was up and they couldn't (by law) keep me that he convinced his bosses that instead of tapping the large free-labor pool that they had access to through the college that they should find budget to *pay me* to continue to work there, which I did until they couldn't keep me there per the rules and hiring practices.

To this day he uses me as an example to other interns of not taking first impressions as gospel and that if you ever get a second chance, to make the most out of it. 

TL;DR: Got picked for very-difficult-to-get internship, made boss think I had absolutely no business being there, completely turned it around.

I got conditionally accepted to WUT for electrical engineering in English. I've heard that programs in English aren't very great, and I've accumulated a lot of questions that I couldn't find answers to, so I hope people here could help me out. 

So, is the difference in the quality of education really big depending on what language you have your courses taught in? 

Does the diploma explicitly say what language the courses are taught in as well? 

Is there any way to eventually transfer from English to Polish once my language is good enough?

Is the job outlook for graduates in English a lot worse than for those who graduated in Polish? Same question goes for internships. 

Does the electrical engineering have any accreditations? I've tried to look for them, but couldn't find anything. 

Thank you guys. I'm just wondering if going there is a good choice, since Poland seems very interesting to me. "

What I experienced is nowhere close to the sexual harassment you hear on the news or read on this subreddit, but it’s still affecting me 2 days and an eternity later. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, except that maybe it’s a way to sort out all my thoughts and tell someone who I won’t have to deal with later. 

My high school has a program that allows seniors to intern at a business instead of attending class for the last month of school. Almost all of us do it. Through a family friend I secured an internship at a small Biochem company a few hours away and my first day was Tuesday. It went horribly. I knew I was already entering into the internship on my back foot; I’m only a high school student with limited STEM experience and capabilities and I tried to make that clear whenever I talked with the head of the department I was interning under. 

When I got there, I was sort of “assigned” to a 50-ish male employee (most of the researchers there were male). I was so nervous all morning and his behavior didn’t make me feel any better. They gave me a “desk” in the middle of the lab and when I accidentally knocked my feet against the employee’s when I slid to the desk on a wheel-y chair, he started kicking my feet and proclaimed loudly that we were playing “footsie”. He’d talk to me about the project he was working on and I was terrified as he asked me to mentally convert numbers to units I had never even heard of and he’d say how *simple* it was and then he’d ask me a question that boiled down to what 5 times 1 is and I’d answer correctly and he’d praise me in this horrible patronizing voice and pat me on the shoulder. I don’t really cry often and when I do it’s because I’m watching a sad movie, but after every time this happened (about every 15 minutes) I felt myself starting to tear up and want to cry. I just said it was allergies. When he wasn’t asking me difficult questions or making weird statements or jokes that were only a few winks away from sexual, he told me to read out of this textbook he gave me as he went to do other work. The introduction said it was for those who already has a “basic graduate-level knowledge” of organic chemistry, biochemistry, etc. I’d sit at my “desk” trying not to cry and wondering what was wrong with me. 

At lunch, we sat separately in the break room. My mom texted me to ask how it was going. I wanted to cry but I didn’t even know why so I texted her something positive and said I had to get back to work. 

In the afternoon, things were different. He didn’t ask me those hard questions anymore. Instead, he showed me around the lab and the equipment and asked rapid-fire questions that were much worse. “Where are you staying?” “What’s your cell number?” “Do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend?” “Do you have an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend?” “Have you ever kissed someone?” And then after we had moved on to a totally separate conversation he’d bring it back to those questions, expressing surprise out loud that I had said “no” to the question about kissing. Again, I would go back to sit at my “desk” and try not to cry. 

All day, he kept on telling me to tell him if he was being creepy or making me uncomfortable. In my head I always thought, “Isn’t it obvious what’s creepy?” Towards the end of the day he called me into his office. He started talking about he’s been married for 20 years and before that he had been in relationships with a lot of women. He said, again, to tell him if he was ever being creepy. He said I should just tell him when he was making me uncomfortable, that I shouldn’t go to HR and get him in trouble/start trouble. I didn’t know what to say. 

I was supposed to stay until 4:30 but at 3:30 I texted my mom, saying I might be coming home that night instead of staying at an empty relative’s house like I had planned. She replied saying to call her when I left the building, that maybe she could drive down and stay the night if I was lonely. At 4:00 I left and I was sobbing by the time I got into my car. It was pouring rain, I was crying, and I didn’t know the area so when I tried to drive back to the house I got hopelessly lost. I parked on a side road and called my mom, sobbing on the phone, and told her what happened. She told me to come home, that I didn’t have to go back there again. It was one of the best things I had ever heard anyone say. I drove back to the house and packed all my stuff in record time. I drove the 2 hours home and by the time I arrived I was all cried out. 

All I wanted to do was forget the whole thing, but I couldn’t. I went over the whole day— everything he said, every time he touched me— with my mom a second and third time. That night and the next morning (Wednesday) she called and emailed all the people who needed to know I was leaving the internship. I had to go over the whole experience again later that day with the HR woman on the phone. He— that same employee— emailed me that morning from his personal email address asking where I was. I forwarded it to my mom and then deleted it. 

I secured another internship with my town’s volunteer rescue squad, on which I already ride as an EMT and which basically entails sitting around and waiting to respond to a call. Everything is sorted now. But I still can’t stop thinking about it. 

I know what happened isn’t a big deal in the scope of sexual harassment. It’s hard to even use those words to describe it. But it still affected me so much more than I ever imagined something like that would. 

It was humiliating and confusing and scary and it’s made me feel so weak and vulnerable and sensitive. A call went out over the squad radio today and I was about to radio in and say I was responding but before I could another squad member— a nice guy I’ve talked with before— radioed in too, as a driver. They still needed an EMT but my immediate reaction was to shut off the radio and change out of my uniform shirt, take a shower and throw on pajamas and spend the day in bed texting my friends about movies and school. I didn’t want to see any guy, especially someone like him who’s so much taller and more muscular than I am. Similarly, I recently saw a “help wanted” sign in the window of a café/bakery downtown and before all of this I was planning to apply for a summer job there to keep busy. My mom suggested I head over there today to ask about the position but I couldn’t. I didn’t want to put myself out there, to talk to some guy I didn’t know to ask for a job. 

This was my first time interning anywhere, especially in a lab. I’ve wanted to study Biochemistry and join that field for years, and I recently committed to a college to do just that. But now I’ve found myself doubting that because I don’t ever want to go into a lab and have that happen again. 

Again, I know that most of it was only words. He never touched or hurt me sexually. But that was my first time trying to do something I had been so excited to do and make a career out of and instead I just feel vulnerable and lonely and still confused and scared because I know logically why he would ask me those questions and say those things but I’m still asking myself “why me?” 

I know all of this will pass, that in a few weeks I probably won’t even remember his voice or how he phrased his questions. I’ll probably be embarrassed I ever posted this, but goddamnit I’m only 18 and I was trying to get experience and instead I’m trying to ask myself *what did I do wrong?* even when I know in my head that the answer is *nothing*. And I realize that I’m never ashamed to tell my friends anything but I never want any of them to know about this."

**GPA**: u3.32, s3.0, c3.44 (add college classes taken at CC in High School &amp; graded EMT course all 4.0 to get the upward cGPA) There is an upward trend in the last 2-3 quarters because of a scholarship that I won that reduced my financial burden as I was fully independent.

**LizzyM score**: 67-68 depending on uGPA or cGPA

**Year in school**: Post-grad
**Residency**: WA / OR (heritage student for one b/c born and graduate HS from there)

**ECs**: I had to work full time to support myself and pay for school solo, so my hours are ridiculously high, but I am proportionately low on community service --and obviously my grades suffered.

8lzd94,1,2018-05-25,M4F My Gullible Neighbor (MILFs Preferred),Dppandpornalts,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8lzd94/m4f_my_gullible_neighbor_milfs_preferred/," 
 
I am an adult lookin for adults for a story that is purely fantasy.  
    
   
I am going to try to set the scene first, if you just want to see the idea for the prompt skip to the end. 
  

A couple moved in next door to me a few weeks ago. I’m staying in my parents friends house, they decided to move overseas for a sabbatical year, and had generously offered me their home, on condition I looked after it. They were both professors at the college I was going to, do it worked out. They got someone to watch the house, and I got to live privately right off campus.  

Back to the couple. He looked to be around 55. A handsome gentleman, looked like he worked in banking, power suit and a silver head of hair. She, on the other hand, looked to be around 40. [Blonde, with a perfect hourglass figure](https://i.redd.it/inp78euigbcz.jpg), she was the type of woman any young man would give their left hand to have as a neighbor. I say left hand, because they would want the right hand if you know what I mean. 


I didn’t have much to do with them the first week, beyond going over to welcome them and introduce myself. The husband seemed nice enough, if not a little preoccupied, and the wife was very bubbly and sweet. I did notice that she was in fantastic shape for her age, but I did catch a glimpse of a private gym in the house so that accounted for her body. 

I left them my number with the offer to call if they needed anything, and I didn’t hear from them for two weeks. One morning, on a Sunday, she called me up to ask me to help set up her wifi. She explained that her husband was at work, being a workaholic, and I was happy to help. That was when I first realized she was a bit dim. The only problem with the WiFi was it was unplugged, but she didn’t seem to understand that. She also had me fix a faucet, which was only not working because she was trying to turn the knob the wrong way. 


Oh, and did I mention [what she was wearing when I got there?](https://i.imgur.com/QITRGrV.jpg). I was happy to help, and quickly did what she needed, before chatting for a few minutes. I didn’t really pay attention, [for obvious reasons](https://i.redd.it/m8m86q5gpfw01.png). But as she droned on, and I eagerly watched and waited for her tits to slip out, I did hear a bit. She mentioned how her husband didn’t let her go to his office anymore, because she would always end up talking to the interns, and once she even let them slap her ass, but just to prove it was real. She explained how at first her husband was upset, but he wasn’t angry after she told him she did it to prove to the interns that their boss had a real wife, not a plastic one. 



After we finished chatting, I went back home, but my mind was filled with ideas. 

**end of scene**


So, if it’s not abundantly clear from the setting, I’m looking for a woman who wants to play a bimbo. Not a cock hungry whore, but rather a really sweet, innocent, and gullible woman. I’ll be the young neighbor who slowly starts to take advantage of her, first in small ways, like convincing her to model her bikinis for me, or even lingerie. But we’ll slowly take it further and further, maybe even involving her husband. Perhaps they are trying to conceive, and I explain that I know the best position to impregnate a woman, but I have to demonstrate it on her. 

I think you get it. My kinks are bimbos, big tits, outfits, naive women, oily sex, public sex, exhibition, anal, eating pussy/ass, cheating, cuckolding, and much much more. I can’t wait for some envelopes.

8m040o,80,2018-05-25,Me (25f) struggling with introverted boyfriend (28m). Together two years,introvertedbfhelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8m040o/me_25f_struggling_with_introverted_boyfriend_28m/,"Hi all,

Thanks in advance for reading my post. I am just looking for some feedback on my situation. Perhaps some have been in my shoes, and others and my boyfriend's. I'd love some insight, as this has basically gone on since the beginning of our relationship, and it's not really getting any better. 

We have been together for two years. I moved in for good a month ago, after we'd been long distance two months.  I am doing my thesis and did and internship in a foreign country, that's 10 hours way in a plane. Before that we lived together for 4 month, and before that I was in this foreign country for 8 months. 

My problem is that I consistently feel that my boyfriend would just rather be alone than be with me. Yesterday, I found out that he has been masturbating when he showers instead of having sex with me. I don't have any problem with masturbation or porn, I do it myself, but he *knows* that I'd love more sex and that very night he turned me down for sex because he was too tired. I told him I only have a problem with masturbation when it ""wins"" over sex with your partner. He says that they're completely different things, and agree that they are, but come on, go have sex with your willing partner instead of wanking in the shower. It's not a one time thing, it's something he says he does consistently.

At another time, I asked him which part of me it felt best to have sex with, and he replied that masturbation actually felt the best. I didn't ask him about masturbation, I asked him about me. I just feel it rather wank on his own than to be with me. I'd love to experiment more sexually and have fun with him, which I have told him numerous times, but nothing really happens. 

He needs *a lot* of alone time, so we've decided  that every two weeks or so I leave the house an entire day, so he can just be by himself. I don't understand why he needs it, but to each their own. When he doesn't need alone time, he needs time to wind down, so he plays computer for a few hours while I study. In this time it would be nice to talk more, but I get it, he needs to wind down after a long day. When we actually get to talk he struggles if I want to talk about ""heavy stuff"". Fine, we don't talk about heavy stuff. All other conversations are solely initiated by me, and he just answers whatever questions I ask him or listens to my stories. It does not feel like a dialogue at all, and I have to remind him to please say more than ""yes"" or to initiate conversations himself.

I can feel myself getting resentful. It hurts that he chooses masturbation over me, it hurts that needs so much alone time when we were just seperated for two months, and that it's so difficult to hold a conversaton. At the same time, I want to give him space and make him happy. He's such a lovely guy. In other ways he's amazing, he cooks for me every day, he takes care of me when I'm sick, he's a great listener and always so supportive of anything that I do. I just can't help to feel that deep inside he'd rather just be on his own, and that makes me feel inadequate. 

I've talked to him about this a million times, and he always says that he loves me, never thought he'd find someone like me and would rather be with me than be on his own. It just doesn't feel like it. 

Does anyone out there have any tips for us? Compromises? Ways we could approach the situation? Insights into my boyfriends mind? 

Thanks in advance!

**Tl:dr;**

Boyfriend of two years seems like he'd rather be on his own. Wants a lot of alone time, masturbates instead of sex and is difficult to hold conversations with. "

&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het bericht «Stapels werk door nieuwe eisen toegankelijkheid»?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is op dit moment de stand van zaken op het gebied van toegankelijkheid van websites van de rijksoverheid, de decentrale medeoverheden en de zelfstandige bestuursorganen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het op transparante wijze afleggen van verantwoording over de toegankelijkheid van overheidswebsites wordt verplicht. Binnenkort treedt het tijdelijk besluit digitale toegankelijkheid overheid in werking. Op dit moment is er echter nog geen volledig beeld, mede omdat de exacte eisen waaraan toegankelijkheidsverklaringen moeten voldoen nog door de Europese Commissie moeten worden vastgesteld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vooruitlopend op de verplichting heeft een aantal overheidsinstanties de eigen websites al laten toetsen op toegankelijkheid. Van 19 websites bij gemeenten, 4 bij provincies, 1 bij een waterschap en 18 bij de rijksoverheid kan worden aangetoond dat ze aan alle toegankelijkheidseisen voldoen. Een grotere groep overheidsinstanties heeft wel verbetering toegepast, maar nog geen volledig resultaat bereikt en/of dit nog niet voldoende inzichtelijk gemaakt. Verwachting is dat na inwerkingtreding van het besluit de verantwoording over webtoegankelijkheid nadrukkelijk zal verbeteren en dat overheidsinstanties hun websites zullen &amp;#40;laten&amp;#41; toetsen op toegankelijkheid.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Blijvende aandacht voor het onderwerp is nodig. Toegankelijkheid is  net als bij informatiebeveiliging en gegevensbescherming  geen project met een begin en een eind, maar een cyclisch proces. Daarbij dienen regelmatig verbeteringen te worden gepland, doorgevoerd, geëvalueerd en geborgd. Alleen op die manier kan een reeds behaald niveau van toegankelijkheid worden vastgehouden en aan verdere verbetering worden gewerkt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het waar dat veel gemeenten nog niet voldoende bezig zijn met het toegankelijk maken van de gemeentelijke websites? Zo ja, waarom aarzelen zij?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
De verplichting om de gemeentelijke websites toegankelijk te maken dateert van 2008. Veel gemeenten zijn er toen mee aan de slag gegaan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er waren ook overheidsinstanties die andere keuzes hebben gemaakt; momenteel geldt voor het niet nakomen van de verplichting geen sanctie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Na inwerkingtreding van het besluit krijgt de verplichting een wettelijke grondslag, met de inwerkingtreding van nationale regelgeving op basis van de Europese webtoegankelijkheidsrichtlijn 2016/2102. De richtlijn schrijft voor dat er een toegankelijkheidsverklaring moet wordt gepubliceerd en ook dat er een adequate en doeltreffende handhavingsprocedure beschikbaar komt om te waarborgen dat de richtlijn wordt nageleefd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gegevens die de afgelopen jaren voor monitoringsdoeleinden zijn verzameld onderbouwen het beeld dat in het artikel wordt geschetst. Waarom gemeenten momenteel zouden aarzelen om aan de slag te gaan met webtoegankelijkheid is mij niet bekend. Ik zal dit betrekken in mijn reguliere overleg met de VNG.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe beoordeelt u de ontwikkelingen om te komen tot toegankelijke digitale overheidswebsites? Wordt er voldoende prioriteit gegeven aan het toegankelijk maken van overheidswebsites? Zijn er voldoende middelen beschikbaar om de websites toegankelijk te maken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het uitgangspunt dat online informatie en dienstverlening door iedereen moeten kunnen worden gebruikt, wordt ook bij overheidsinstanties breed onderschreven. Uit metingen en studies blijkt echter dat de weg naar aansprekende resultaten, vooral vanwege praktische en organisatorische redenen, lang niet zo gemakkelijk is als algemeen wordt verondersteld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De brede onderschrijving van het uitgangspunt leidt tot dusverre niet bij alle overheidsinstanties tot het maken van plannen of concrete acties. In de dagelijkse praktijk wordt regelmatig aan andere onderwerpen een hogere prioriteit toegekend dan aan webtoegankelijkheid. Dat geldt ook voor het beschikbaar maken van middelen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Een verplichting met een wettelijke grondslag, inclusief toezicht en handhaving, zal er toe leiden dat meer prioriteit zal worden gegeven aan webtoegankelijkheid.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke onderdelen valt volgens u nog veel winst te behalen om de digitale toegankelijkheid van overheidswebsites te verbeteren?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik verwacht dat onder invloed van het Tijdelijk besluit digitale toegankelijkheid overheid toegankelijkheid de komende jaren meer bestuurlijke aandacht zal krijgen. Het toegankelijker maken van websites vergt bestuurlijk commitment, de reeds genoemde bestuurlijke aandacht, budget, inzet van de juiste expertise en ten slotte inzicht in de punten die nog niet in overeenstemming zijn met de toegankelijkheidscriteria. Wanneer aan de genoemde voorwaarden wordt voldaan kunnen de bestuurders van overheidsinstanties doelgerichter sturen op verbetering van de toegankelijkheid dan tot dusverre mogelijk was, omdat de toegankelijkheidsverklaring, naast het huidige inzicht of aan alle eisen wordt voldaan, voortaan ook inzicht zal geven in de vorderingen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De toegankelijkheidsverklaringen zullen het monitoren van toegankelijkheid van overheidswebsites vergemakkelijken en vertegenwoordigende organen, zoals gemeenteraden, helpen hun controlerende taak uit te oefenen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is de stand van zaken op het gebied van digitale toegankelijkheid bij andere decentrale overheden zoals de provincies, waterschappen en de bijzondere openbare lichamen in Caribisch Nederland? Moeten zij ook aan de nieuwe Europese regels voldoen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het Tijdelijk besluit digitale toegankelijkheid overheid is van toepassing op de delen van het Koninkrijk die op Europees grondgebied liggen. Decentrale overheden zoals de provincies en waterschappen behoren tot de overheidsinstanties waarop het besluit van toepassing is.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor de gevraagde stand van zaken bij decentrale overheden verwijs ik naar het antwoord op vraag 2.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7, 8 en 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
7: Verwacht u dat alle gemeenten en andere decentrale overheden in september 2018 een plan van aanpak klaar zullen hebben?  
&amp;nbsp;    
8: Wat gaat u doen als gemeenten &amp;#40;en andere overheden&amp;#41; het plan van aanpak niet tijdig klaar hebben?  
&amp;nbsp;    
9: Wordt bij de beoordeling van de plannen van aanpak ook gekeken of de gemeenten &amp;#40;en andere overheden&amp;#41; rekening houden met mensen die zelf minder digitaal vaardig zijn en hoe deze mensen op een laagdrempelige manier alsnog gebruik kunnen maken van de goed toegankelijke digitale voorzieningen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7, 8 en 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Van de in het artikel genoemde verplichting dat elke gemeente voor september met een plan van aanpak moet komen is geen sprake. Na inwerkingtreding van het besluit is het aan de verantwoordelijke overheidsinstanties zelf hieraan invulling te geven. Ik ga er vanuit dat zij deze serieus oppakken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarbij zullen overheidsinstanties de komende tijd worden gestimuleerd om intern maatregelen te nemen met als doel om aan het besluit te kunnen voldoen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De focus van mijn aanpak is om, nadat het model ervoor door de Europese Commissie is vastgesteld, overheidsinstanties te ondersteunen bij het opstellen van toegankelijkheidsverklaringen. Die verklaringen zullen inzicht bieden in hoe ver individuele overheidsinstanties gevorderd zijn met de toegankelijkheid van hun websites en apps.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast kan het team van Digitoegankelijk.nl overheidsinstanties die nog op gang moeten komen helpen met praktische informatie, tips, plannen van aanpak en ervaringen van andere overheidsinstanties.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik acht het belangrijk dat digitale informatie en dienstverlening van de overheid door iedereen kan worden gebruikt, dus ook voor mensen die minder digitaal vaardig zijn.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast onderzoek ik, onder meer in samenwerking met gemeenten, hoe ik een extra impuls kan geven aan de bevordering van digitale vaardigheden van mensen en zo hun zelfredzaamheid kan versterken. Op een eerder moment heb ik al toegezegd dat ik de Kamer nader zal informeren over een samenhangende aanpak voor digitale inclusie van het kabinet.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u gemeenten &amp;#40;en andere overheden&amp;#41; extra ondersteuning bieden als dat gewenst is? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor gemeenten en andere overheidsinstanties die aan de slag willen met toegankelijkheid is al ondersteuning beschikbaar. Een goede eerste maatregel om te gaan werken aan verbetering is gebruik van het ‘Stappenplan toegankelijke website’ op de website Digitoegankelijk.nl.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het team van Digitoegankelijk.nl treedt op als vraagbaak en biedt naast de informatie op de website ondersteuning met praktische informatie, tips, plannen van aanpak en ervaringen die andere overheidsinstanties met toegankelijkheid hebben opgedaan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid om de Kamer na september 2018 nader te informeren over de stand van zaken? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals in het antwoord op vraag 7 is gesteld is er in september 2018 geen deadline om een plan van aanpak klaar te hebben. Uiteraard ben ik wel bereid om de Kamer te informeren over de voortgang van de uitvoering van het tijdelijk besluit toegankelijkheid digitale overheid.)

Vragen van het lid Belhaj &amp;#40;D66&amp;#41; aan de minister van Defensie over het bericht dat de Koninklijke Marechaussee etnisch profileert op Eindhoven Airport. &amp;#40;ingezonden 4 mei 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het bericht “Oud-raadslid Bamenga uit Eindhoven ontzettend woedend om 'etnisch profileren' op Eindhoven Airport”? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u het er mee eens dat het een vereiste is van behoorlijk overheidsoptreden dat grondrechten van burgers worden gerespecteerd en dat artikel 1 van de Grondwet een belangrijke basis biedt voor de bestrijding van discriminatie? Bent u het er voorts mee eens dat het discriminatieverbod voor bestuursorganen inhoudt dat zij geen onderscheid mogen maken naar godsdienst, levensovertuiging, politieke gezindheid, ras, geslacht of op welke grond dan ook? Zo ja, waarom? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het voorgaande met zich meebrengt dat ambtenaren bij hun optreden personen op grond van hun uiterlijk en/of afkomst niet in negatieve zin anders mogen behandelen dan andere personen en dat ook de schijn van een dergelijk optreden op grond van iemands uiterlijk en/of afkomst dient te worden vermeden? Zo ja, waarom? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het rapport “Uit de rij gehaald”, een onderzoek naar de wijze waarop de Kmar het Mobiele Toezicht Veiligheid op Rotterdam The Hague Airport verrichtte? Zo ja, bent u voorts bekend met het advies van de Nationale Ombudsman om op basis van objectieve criteria de MTV-controles in te zetten zodat &amp;#40;de schijn van&amp;#41; discriminaties op basis van huidskleur vermeden wordt? 3&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vragen 1, 2, 3 en 11:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe duidt u de gebeurtenissen van afgelopen maandag op Eindhoven Airport, waaruit blijkt dat meerdere personen op basis van hun huidskleur apart genomen werden voor extra controle?  
&amp;nbsp;    
9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u in uw antwoord reflecteren op het gegeven dat op Eindhoven Airport niet alleen twee mannen &amp;#40;apart van elkaar&amp;#41; met een donkere huidskleur uit de rij werden gehaald, maar ook een donkere vrouw met kinderen? Bent u het eens dat de mannen en de vrouw met kinderen compleet verschillende profielen hebben behalve hun overeenkomstige huidskleur? Bent u het er mee eens dat hiermee het beeld kan ontstaan dat sprake was van etnisch profileren? Waarom wel of waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op de vragen 4 en 9:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik vind het vervelend dat betrokkene de controle als kwetsend en discriminerend ervaren heeft. Non-discriminatoir handelen is het uitgangspunt bij alle uitvoeringshandelingen van de KMar. Profileren is een belangrijk element voor de KMar om informatie gestuurd, professioneel en integer uitvoering te geven aan haar taken ten behoeve van de veiligheid van Nederland.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De Koninklijke Marechaussee heeft naar aanleiding van de berichtgeving zelf contact opgenomen met betrokkene en heeft betrokkene uitgenodigd om een klacht in te dienen. Wanneer een klacht wordt ingediend, zal de klachtenprocedure in gang worden gezet en zal de gebeurtenis worden geduid aan de hand van constateringen van beide partijen. Op dit moment is nog geen klacht van betrokkene ontvangen. De Koninklijke Marechaussee en betrokkene zijn nog in gesprek met elkaar.   
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid om te onderzoeken of deze casus duidt op een trend of past in een breder patroon?  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat klachten over discriminatie zeer ernstig dienen te worden genomen en dat wanneer er serieuze aanwijzingen zijn deze grondig dienen te worden onderzocht? Zo ja, gaat u naar aanleiding van het incident op Eindhoven Airport zelfstandig onderzoek verrichten? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat juist bij een beschuldiging als deze in het kader van de Mobiele Toezicht Veiligheidscontroles het ook in het belang is van het bestuursorgaan om deze klacht te onderzoeken en precies te achterhalen wat er is gebeurd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vragen 5, 6 en 7:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, klachten over discriminatie neem ik zeer serieus en zullen grondig moeten worden onderzocht. Ik deel de mening dat het ook in het belang van het bestuursorgaan is, om beschuldigingen als deze als klacht te onderzoeken. De Koninklijke Marechaussee heeft contact opgenomen met betrokkene en heeft hem uitgenodigd om een klacht in te dienen. Op dit moment is nog geen klacht van betrokkene ontvangen. De Koninklijke Marechaussee en de betrokkene zijn in gesprek met elkaar.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast reflecteert de Koninklijke Marechaussee intern op haar handelen zowel ten aanzien van een individuele casus als aan de hand van analyses die kunnen duiden op trends of patronen. Hierbij verwijs ik tevens naar de antwoorden op de vragen 17 t/m 20.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met de reactie van de Koninklijke Marechaussee &amp;#40;Kmar&amp;#41;, waarin het volgende werd aangeven: “Profileren is een belangrijk middel voor de Marechaussee. De profielen berusten op historische ervaringen en cijfers, informatie, inlichtingen en risico-indicatoren. Het uiterlijk voorkomen &amp;#40;waaronder etniciteit&amp;#41; kan hierbij relevant zijn, maar altijd mede op grond van andere objectieve indicatoren of informatie”? 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u het er mee eens dat huidskleur en/of &amp;#40;vermeende&amp;#41; afkomst nooit een objectieve indicator is of iemand een zware crimineel of terrorist is en nooit een reden mag zijn voor een controle?  
&amp;nbsp;    
14  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke aanvullend beleid is er ingevoerd om &amp;#40;de schijn van&amp;#41; etnisch profileren te vermijden naar aanleiding van bijvoorbeeld het rapport «Beslissen in Grensgebieden» van de Universiteit Leiden &amp;#40;april 2016&amp;#41; door professor Maartje van der Woude?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vragen 10 en 14:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Non-discriminatoir handelen is het uitgangspunt bij alle uitvoeringshandelingen van de KMar. Profileren is een belangrijk middel voor de KMar om informatiegestuurd, professioneel en integer haar taken ten behoeve van de veiligheid van Nederland te verrichten. De KMar gebruikt profielen die berusten op historische ervaringen en cijfers, informatie, inlichtingen en risico-indicatoren. Op basis van deze profielen wordt met behulp van technische middelen bepaald wie wordt gecontroleerd. Ook wordt gekeken naar afwijkingen van de norm, risico-indicatoren en specifieke signaleringen van personen. Het uiterlijk voorkomen &amp;#40;waaronder etniciteit&amp;#41; kan hier onderdeel van uitmaken, maar altijd in combinatie met andere objectieve indicatoren of informatie zoals hierboven genoemd. Daarnaast moet een controle uitlegbaar zijn en dient correcte bejegening van personen voorop te staan. Ter ondersteuning hiervan is gekozen om de Behavior Detection methode Predictive Profiling breed in de organisatie te hanteren. De methode biedt handvatten voor zelfreflectie, objectief handelen en het verbaliseren van waargenomen afwijkend gedrag.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie ook de beantwoording op de Kamervragen van 13 april 2017 &amp;#40;Aanhangsel van de Handelingen, vergaderjaar 2016-2017, nr. 1900&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
12  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke wijze is door zowel het Ministerie van Defensie als de Kmar opvolging gegeven aan het rapport “Uit de rij gehaald” en de aanbevelingen van de Nationale ombudsman? Hoe verhoudt de reactie van de woordvoerder van de Kmar in het Eindhovens Dagblad hiertoe dan wel het naar aanleiding van die aanbeveling gewijzigde beleid?  
&amp;nbsp;    
13  
&amp;nbsp;    
In welke mate heeft de KMar sinds 19 mei 2017 naar aanleiding van de beantwoording van Kamervragen over het bericht dat de marechaussee bij de Rotterdam The Hague Airport discrimineert, werkelijk objectieve criteria aangepast? Kunt u in uw antwoord reflecteren op uw beantwoording van destijds, waarin werd aangegeven dat de KMar doorlopend beziet of objectieve criteria moeten worden aangepast en aangevuld om de informatie gestuurde controles zorgvuldig te kunnen uitvoeren en op een juiste manier te kunnen profileren? 4&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
15  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke initiatieven en concrete maatregelen worden op dit moment binnen de KMar genomen om etnisch profileren te voorkomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden op vragen 12, 13 en 15:  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Koninklijke Marechaussee heeft reeds een werkgroep ‘Profileren’ ingesteld die zich bezighoudt met het verder verbeteren van profileringstechnieken en het breed uitdragen van de Behavior Detection methode Predictive Profiling in de organisatie. De medewerkers worden opgeleid afwijkend gedrag te detecteren. Hierbij wordt ook aandacht besteed aan de &amp;#40;relevantie van de&amp;#41; indicator ‘etniciteit’. Tevens wordt er in de uitvoering geïnvesteerd in specifieke profileringstechnieken gericht op gedragsonderkenning. De implementatie van deze maatregelen is nog volop aan de gang.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De KMar neemt samen met de NCTV deel aan de European Civil Aviation Conference &amp;#40;ECAC&amp;#41; Behavior Detection Studygroup &amp;#40;BDSG&amp;#41;. Doelstellingen van deze BDSG zijn het uitwisselen van kennis en ervaring op het gebied van ‘Behavior Detection’. De KMar streeft naar verbetering en vooruitgang en heeft daarom haar methode onlangs onderworpen aan de kritische blik van onze internationale ketenpartners in de luchthavenbranche en de wetenschap &amp;#40;ECAC BDSG&amp;#41;. De methode van de KMar dient nu zelfs als voorbeeld voor onze partners.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De KMar heeft een nieuwe folder Mobiel Toezicht Veiligheid &amp;#40;MTV&amp;#41; ontwikkeld. De brochure is gemaakt om de burger die staande is gehouden bij een MTV-controle informatie mee te geven. Het helpt daarmee ook de KMar-collega bij vragen van burgers over de MTV-controle en/of staande houding. Uit de rapportage is naar voren gekomen dat er behoefte is naar eenduidige uitleg over de controle zoals door ons wordt uitgevoerd. Deze nieuwe meertalige folder is vanaf 14 mei 2018 beschikbaar.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Objectieve criteria en profielen zijn plaats –en tijdsgebonden. Al naar gelang van veranderde modus operandi, trends, ervaring, risico-indicatoren, informatie van &amp;#40;internationale&amp;#41;partners worden de objectieve criteria en profielen aangepast. Deze profielen zijn vertrouwelijk en worden intern gebruikt.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Tenslotte is met de Nationale Ombudsman is afgesproken dat hij binnenkort een werkbezoek aan de Koninklijke Marechaussee brengt, zodat hij de voortgang van zijn aanbevelingen kan zien en beoordelen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
16  
&amp;nbsp;    
In hoeverre is etnisch profileren onderdeel van de scholing en opleiding binnen Defensie? In hoeverre vindt u de eerder genomen maatregelen en initiatieven voldoende?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Professioneel en integer optreden zitten in alle opleidingen verweven. Als rode draad in de opleiding komt het overal aan bod. Het is een vaardigheid die continue aangescherpt wordt. In opleidingen, trainingen en dagelijkse briefings wordt hier dan ook aandacht aan besteed. Daarnaast zijn informatie en e-learning modules over het uitvoeren van controles beschikbaar via de &amp;#40;mobiele&amp;#41; digitale werkplek en worden medewerkers getraind om elkaar aan te spreken op onjuist gedrag. De Behavior Detection methode Predictive Profiling is thans geïntegreerd in de initiële opleidingen op het taakveld bewaken en beveiligen en wordt geïntegreerd in de overige initiële opleidingen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
17  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ziet u aanleiding om actief beleid &amp;#40;en dus meer dan op basis van ingediende klachten&amp;#41; te voeren om een beeld te krijgen van de omvang van etnisch profileren door de KMar op vliegvelden? Zo ja, op welke wijze? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
18  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven hoeveel klachten er zijn ingediend sinds april 2017 met betrekking tot etnisch profileren door de KMar? Op welke wijze zijn dergelijke klachten afgehandeld?  
&amp;nbsp;    
19  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid periodiek verslaglegging doen over het aantal meldingen aan de Kamer? Zo ja, met welke frequentie? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
20  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven hoe het is gesteld met de meldingsbereidheid met betrekking tot klachten over etnisch profileren door de KMar? Zo ja, indien deze laag is, kunt u dan aangeven waardoor dit komt en bent u bereid om de meldingsbereidheid te verhogen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden op vragen 17, 18, 19 en 20:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vanaf april 2017 heef de Koninklijke Marechaussee acht klachten ontvangen over etnisch profileren. De meldingsbereidheid met betrekking tot klachten is de laatste jaren sterk vergroot. De melder/klager kan een klacht/melding indienen middels een internetformulier, een email of middels brief op het postadres. De melder kan ook contact opnemen middels het centrale 0800-1814 nummer waarbij deze telefonisch te woord wordt gestaan en melder het proces wordt toegelicht. Tot slot zijn op de doorlaatposten dan wel controle posten van de Koninklijke Marechaussee folders ter beschikking in diverse talen welke uitgereikt kunnen worden aan de melder indien deze een klacht wenst in te dienen. Alle klachten, waaronder over etnisch profileren die worden ingediend, worden afgehandeld conform de Algemene wet bestuursrecht &amp;#40;AWB&amp;#41;. Voor de behandeling van deze klachten heeft de Koninklijke Marechaussee haar eigen Klachtenregeling politietaken Koninklijke Marechaussee/krijgsmacht 2004. De klachten krijgen eerst behandeling in de eerste fase &amp;#40;ook wel informele fase genoemd&amp;#41;. Hierbij tracht de Koninklijke Marechaussee in gesprek ter gaan met melder en het eventueel geschonden vertrouwen te herstellen en te leren uit de ervaring&amp;#40;en&amp;#41; van melder. Mocht dit in de eerste fase niet zijn gelukt, dan wordt de klacht voorgelegd aan de Onafhankelijke klachtencommissie. Deze commissie bestaat niet uit medewerkers van Defensie/Koninklijke Marechaussee. Op basis van het advies van de commissie wordt door/namens de Commandant Koninklijke Marechaussee de “Beslissing op Klacht” gesteld. Mocht melder het hier niet mee eens zijn, dan kan melder zich wenden tot de Nationale Ombudsman.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Koninklijke Marechaussee analyseert de ontwikkelingen en berichten uit de maatschappij voor wat betreft de betekenis voor de uitvoering van haar processen. Ontwikkelingen voortkomend uit klachten worden zo snel mogelijk gesignaleerd en hierover wordt jaarlijks verslaglegging gedaan in het Jaarverslag Integriteit KMar. Vanaf 2018 zal in het jaarverslag expliciet ingegaan worden op het beeld en omvang van etnisch profileren door de Koninklijke Marechaussee op vliegvelden. De Koninklijke Marechaussee is daarnaast voornemens om haar ingestelde beleid te evalueren.

If anyone has worked with SEO/Google rankings before, I would greatly appreciate some words of wisdom.

I'm interning at a company this summer that is well-respected in the sports industry. It's a smaller business than some of its competitors, so faces challenges growing its online profile for organic sales.

When tasked at analyzing it's social media output, I came across something even more stupefying. They aren't even on the top few pages of Google results when I search for phrases that are keywords in links on their website. This is a company that has no problem bringing in revenue; it's not like its some obscure website. However, if it were higher on Google, I think it would help the company a ton with organic sales.

If you're willing, I'd love to just bounce some ideas off your head and see if you think I'm on the right track. I have no prior experience and am learning on the fly to try to help out this company during my internship.

Introduction:

Hello, everyone! This is my first haul from Taobao. I was looking for some dress shirts (Paul Smith, Thom Browne, Fred Perry, Polo Ralph Lauren) for an upcoming internship, along with some polos (Fred Perry) and casual tees (Vineyard Vines) for Fridays and weekends. In addition, I bought a selection of swim shorts/trunks (Vilebrequin, Lacoste, Hurley) for the beach. Finally, bought a duffle bag (Polo Ralph Lauren) for weekend travel, and a pair of joggers (Nike) for the gym. 

[Complete haul details and pics can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hZ-OjQwNfJpgrCnyDYnGGR0VyTpO1QjSuAsdGrdEes8/edit?usp=sharing)

***
Shipping:

I used Taobao Consolidated Shipping to the US. Haul took a total of 12 days to be delivered and I paid $37 for shipping with JCEX-USPS. Spent 4 days in China, then around 3 days in JFK/NYC customs, before taking 5 days for domestic shipping from NYC to the Mid-West. 
US domestic shipping was covered by FedEx Smartpost (FedEx-USPS hybrid service), which is one of the slower and less reliable options. All around decent shipping times, but I might go for EMS/DHL in the future if I wanted the haul sooner.

174cm/5ft 8.5in; 63kg/140lb

Shoulder 42cm, Chest 96cm, Waist 30-32in.

Slim, athletic build. 

I usually go for an S for my upper body, and I prefer slim-fit clothing. This is actually what drove me to start buying from Taobao as I don't like wearing baggier American-fit clothing.

I usually wear an S/30-32 for my lower body, but Chinese sizing is slightly different so sized up once or twice for this haul.

Some additional thoughts:

* The dress shirts are all of great quality and are most definitely retail. I really like the fact that the sizing is more of a slim-fit than the usual stuff I can find from American stores. Ultimately though, I will still get these altered for a better fit. Just a pity that there isn't more variety when it comes to the Paul Smith, as that is my favorite out of the four. 

* The Fred Perry polos are great. Once again, definitely retail. The back of the logos are a bit coarse on the skin, but I think some washing/sandpapering will do the trick. 

* The Vineyard Vines T-Shirt. It looks like VV might have moved some manufacturing lines to China, as this T-Shirt definitely looks like a retail version (even the price on the tag is accurate to retail!). Will keep scouring Taobao for more VV. However, I am disappointed that I was sent the wrong design. Seller was also a pain to talk to and refused to take responsibility. Let me know if you would like to buy/trade this shirt. 

* The Nike joggers are amazing. Great quality, and they feel way better than the retail Under Armour joggers I paid three times the price for. 

* The Vilebrequin shorts. Between the two sellers, it is clear that the Blue Turtles shorts ($20) is made of better material and has a higher quality as compared to the other two shorts ($8). Considering that a Vilebrequin usually retails for $290 (!!), I would highly recommend the $20 pair for the quality. But if you are price sensitive, the $8 pairs are good value and still a better choice than the Lacoste pair below. 

* Lacoste Swim Shorts. I know this is all the rage in this subreddit, but I feel that this is not worth buying, especially considering the many other available options. The material feels cheap and canvas-y. I'd recommend paying just that bit more and get the Vilebrequin or Hurley shorts instead.

* I was pleasantly surprised by these Hurley shorts. The material is so smooth and comfortable. If you prefer board shorts, this pair is the way to go. The seller has many more designs in their shop as well. Highly recommended, great find.

* Love the duffle bag. Not many left, and this looks like the only remaining link. Buy it quick. 

Overall, this was a great haul. Most things were a hit, and the decision to go with consolidated shipping paid off as only one item was sent incorrectly. I'll be giving some of the shorts to my friends, and keeping all the shirts (except the VV shirt - contact me if you are interested!). 
Hopefully this helps you with your summer haul as well. Work hard and play hard!"
8m3jbg,19,2018-05-25,Being productive on days off,finnishblood,adderall,https://www.reddit.com/r/adderall/comments/8m3jbg/being_productive_on_days_off/,"I was prescribed Adderall for ADD this past winter. I started with a 10mg XR script that my doctor said to try out. I tried 10mg the first time I took it, and can't say I noticed any effects. I was also taking 150mg WellbutrinXR at the time, and would compare the combination of the two to a cup of coffee that lasted for 12 hours. The second time I tried it, I took 20mg, and definitely noticed a difference, I had more mental and physical energy (which is definitely what I use Adderall the most for), but the motivation and focus that Adderall is known for was still lacking. The third time I tried 30mg, and is was quite intense. I actually had motivation and was finally doing things that had been on my to-do list for months. However, it was also to the point where if I wasn't doing something productive I would get anxious, or even if I was doing something I would just think to myself ""I have to get this done as quickly as possible so I can work on other stuff, since I only have so long before this wears off."" I also had a crazy headache that started around 6pm. Now I know that anxiety/jitterness was because my tolerance was basically zero, and the headache/rough comedown was because I didn't drink nearly enough water or force myself to eat anything despite the lack of appetite. 

Okay, so now after my 10mg script ran out, my doc prescribed me a 25mgXR script, since it seemed to be the sweet spot for my current body size and tolerance. I took it 2-4 times a week throughout the semester and it worked pretty well for me. I got my highest GPA since freshman year (college), and I had a semi normal sleep schedule for the first time in a long time. 

Now, I'm working a internship, and I'm on a pretty regular schedule of taking the meds Monday/Wednesday/Friday at ~6:45-7am. I try getting a little more rest until 7:30-8am when it is starting to fully kick in, and then I get up and start getting ready. I've noticed that there's always a lull in my energy/motivation around 12-1pm, which I know is because the first release is ending and the second dose hasn't started hitting yet. Normally I have no issues, but sometimes I notice some sadness and just get around it by talking to someone or changing what I'm working on. Since the end of the semester I started running, so after work I normally go for a 3-5mi run and do some strength exercises. Then I finally have an appetite for a nice dinner, before I start winding down for bed. 

Only other info really is that I normally drink ~100floz of water throughout the day, eat some small snacks throughout the morning/afternoon, and then have a good sized dinner. I drink 1-3 cups of coffee depending on how I'm feeling. I also take a Tums in the afternoon when I notice the lull, and take a vitamin/supplement pill on my off days. 

I feel like I have a good routine, and seem to not have any major comedown issues and if I have any trouble getting to sleep, I am prescribed Ambien to help with that. My issues are on the Tuesdays and Thursdays and even weekends (tho less so), I am consistently tired (even if I get 8-10 hours of sleep) and I struggle to get work done. I drink 3 or 4 cups of coffee on days off and still have no energy. By the time I leave work, all I want to do for the rest of the day is lay on the couch by myself and watch Netflix/YouTube and maybe play some video games. Since I don't run on Tuesdays or Thursdays, those are the days I have the most time to hang out with friends and go out and do things before I need to go to sleep, but I have next to zero mental/physical energy to actually get up and go do anything. 

I don't want to have to take Adderall everyday since I know my tolerance would go up and I don't want to deal with the lack of appetite, dry mouth, and constant need to go to the bathroom every day.

What do you guys do on days off to be productive and have energy to go out have fun?

We are fairly young (30) but it feels exhausting now and not many memorable moments occur anymore. I guess the problem has been there since day one, she is unable to keep up with house work (Laundry, cleaning, dishes, etc.) despite her not been employed and only having one child.  Don't think I'm one of those guys who has unrealistic and old fashioned expectations from his wife. I fully understand that being a housewife and mother are difficult jobs. However, dirty clothes will be piled in a corner for, literally, weeks. I have taken it upon myself to do my own laundry because it is the only way I know I will have clean clothes for work and to let help her out. This has been going on for years. At the beginning I thought patience and love would help her come around. However, even when I had 2 jobs, went to school full time, and was doing an internship she wouldn't pick up her slack. There is nothing worse than waking up on Saturday morning to a sink full of dirty dishes, clothes on the hallways and in every room, and a dirty living room. Instead of focusing on doing homework I begin to clean, which she takes as an insult and gives me the silent treatment. We have talked about it in the past and once she gets past her anger and defensiveness she says she will try harder. She will have the house clean for two days before she returns to her old self. This has been going on for 10 years. On top all of this, our sex life is a joke. She is very selfish, she likes and asks for me to give her oral sex, yet she will never do it for me. During the last 6 weeks we've had sex once. I do everything I can to make sure she enjoys her self, foreplay, oral sex, toys, I can go about 40 to 50 minutes or until she has 2 or 3 orgasms. All that effort and what do I get? No oral sex, no foreplay, we only have sex when she wants, and her just laying on her side with her vibrator with no effort whatsoever but that is another story for another time. I honestly don't like to go home anymore. Am I wrong to feel this way?"

Even though he is retired, he still lives in New D.C. and often comes in to offer advice \- especially around Hatching Season.*

Yes, we failed. I think it’s a damn stupid thing to try and deny it. But everyone likes to ignore why we failed.

This was a different time. The internet had wormed its way into every single part of modern society. It was in our computers, in our pockets, in our cars, in our classrooms. And for years and years now, it was being used to used to spread misinformation. Viral marketing campaigns, propaganda bots, outright lies, pranks...the internet was a cellpool of bullshit at the time. So when some intern comes to me and tells me the internet is talking about dragons in Russia? Fucking \*dragons\*? Talking like that at the CIA? Damn right I busted him down to coffee boy on the spit.

It’s not that we completely ignored it. We were already looking into the sickness as best we could. The Russians weren’t cooperating, but we wanted to know what the hell this disease that acted like an allergy but decimated a town could possibly be. The current working theory was that it wasn’t a disease, but a chemical weapon, that Putin had weaponized allergies somehow and it had gotten loose in the town. It made more sense than some sickness, or a terrorist group having their hands on a chemical agent no one had ever heard of. But there weren’t any incidents we could find that would have caused a chemical leak.

I saw the video, same as everyone else. I thought it was great CGI. Don’t give me that look, that’s what most of the planet thought when they first saw the damn thing. We did start entertaining that some new kind of drone was being used in the region. Maybe it had been a chemical, and they’d mounted flamethowers to drones to burn it away. Or maybe it was drones taking out sick people before they could spread the sickness. 

*He sighs.*

You gotta understand what the country was like back then. We’d just come out of an election that had been even more divisive than the last one. We were at each other’s throats. The FBI was tied up dealing radicals and militias, and we were busy trying to deal with propaganda \- both foreign and domestic. Asshole tech billionaires were letting pretty much anyone buy American data, and we couldn’t get Congress to stop bickering long enough to get everything done since they all wanted to put their corporate sponsors or narrow ideologies first. No one could agree on who was the real threat, and our operational objectives were completely changing every four years. It was a goddamn nightmare.

So when the dragons first were mentioned to us, we blew it off. Completely. Someday I hope I forgive myself for that. 

*What changed your mind?*

When we started getting help from the SVR. Back then working with Russia...well, lets just say we weren’t quite back to the Cold War, but general atmosphere was too damn close to it. So when the SVR started sending us unedited videos of soldiers having these giant damn lizards pounce on them, of them shooting flames that could slice through an T\-14 Armata\* like it was made of butter and cotton candy. That’s when we started to sit up and take it seriously. It was looking to be the most open exchange of information between us and Russia since World War II.

*Anthony slams his desk with his fist.*

And they blew it. 

*The Russians?*

No, not the Russians. I won’t say they wouldn’t have blown it at some point, but we didn’t need them to. The cowards on our side. Like I said, we as a country hadn’t been this divided since the first Civil War. Some analysts even thought we were heading to a second one, a messy, insurgency style Civil War. Hell, I couldn’t argue with them. I’d seen the same reports, and...well, everyone knows what happened with the Heaven’s Stalwarts and everything that happened after that. We’re still dealing with the fallout of that. I don’t know if they would have risen up if not for the dragons, but it was everything we were afraid of. Those damn cowards said it was a European problem. 

Hell, the dragons were in Russia, and lots of people that was a damn fine fate for them given all their bullshit. We tried to tell them the dragons weren’t going to fly into the Kremlin and bite Putin’s face off, that the Russian people were the ones suffering. That it could spread into Europe, and that got the other side all hot and bothered to see our ‘allies’ taken down a peg.  We even showed them the damn videos, made them watch people die to these monsters, and this one Senator, this cockhead from Alabama? He laughed over the screams. 

So America was out of it, at least at first. We had the Atlantic on the one side, the Pacific on the other. We did everything we could to stop it, but no one in Congress believed it. So we kept the American people in the dark, and devoted what we could to keeping an eye on the situation before it got any worse.

No one thought we might need to screen for damn eggs. 

\**The T\-14 Armata was the main battle tank of the Russian Army prior to the Burning. Western intelligence was unsure on how many T\-14’s the Russian Army could purchase or deploy at any given time. They were deployed against the dragons due to the better tracking speed of their armaments compared to earlier tank models.*  "

SO far, 10/10 with the logitech G403 mouse. Has good input buttons with great response, clicking is quiet yet functional enough for me to understand that the button has been pressed. Mouse wheel is crispy and tracker seems to be working fine. The mouse is well weighted as well, reccomend it to anyone who is entering gaming mice. 

I just have a question, on most gaming mice there is a button that sets DPI, its right behind the SCROLL WHEEL, a very small button that, if pressed, alternates between different DPI settings.

For my Logitech G403 is it,

Very slow

Normal

Fast \(I am using this\)

Very fast 

At my internship we use a 3rd party software to scan data from dental clients which is on anotehr server, but it fucks up my DPI. Like it gets incredibly slow, and it is so frustrating. 

I am looking for a way to configure my DPI settings \(on the button\) so my alterations become:

Very Slow

Normal

Fast \(Iam using this\)

Fastest possible on my mouse

THe reason I wanna do this is so when I  enter the softtware I can switch to the faster DPI setting by using the button on my mouse, and if I'm gaming back on y regular laptop outside of the dental program I can switch back to ""Fast"". 

Anyone know how to configure and edit this button?"
8m66an,5,2018-05-25,Computer Engineering/Relationship/Re-enlisting...can I have it all?,[deleted],AirForce,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/8m66an/computer_engineeringrelationshipreenlistingcan_i/,"I've been thinking of re\-enlisting, but this time going back to the reserves. I'm currently pursuing a computer engineering degree, and I've made a lot of progress but still have a ways to go. I'm thinking two years more. During my first service term, I fell in love with another service member, and we've been together off and on, the longest time being since 2015 till now minus a bump in relationship. Lately, I've been missing being a part of a network of people who share the same principles and priorities that dictated our professionalism on the job, but the way we lived our lives outside of uniform. In the people I worked with I saw that they had taken authority over their lives no matter what obstacle came there way and I continuously strove to emulate them. I felt like Kung Fu Panda, Po, having joined the Magnificent 5, but instead of 5 the top 1&amp;#37; in the country. Don't know why I like that kid's movie, but it has a lot of dramatically inspiring undertones I don't see that easily in other similar animated, feature length films. I miss the people in the service, but I wanted to be a computer engineer and improve the technology of Air Force aerospace technologies especially sensors on drones. I'm really good at Calculus, computer programming, and physics to my surprise especially seeing where I started, and I want to apply my skills and abilities as a computer engineer in support of Air Force objectives. Maybe I could have become a computer engineer while active duty. If true, I didn't see that option or nobody told me there was one. 

What's holding me back then? Well, I'm in love, and I want to stay together, but I'm wondering if I should just pursue my own interests. We talked about getting married next year, but that's next year and anything could happen between now and then. This conflict of interests has been on my mind nearly everyday: \(1\) join the reserves, stay where I am and stay in college, go to any 4 year university I want, possibly deploy, reach new heights in my professional career, both military and engineering or \(2\) stay together, hopefully find a 4 year college I like after we move, find  another internship to support my studies and reach new heights in my professional career as a civilian. I start working for a software development and engineering firm as an intern in a month or so following a series of interviews; the company does extensive work for a local Air Force base in aerospace technologies, additive manufacturing, and material sciences. I'm excited to do it, but if I leave for training in a new AFSC I'm not sure if that job will be there when I come back. In general it won't be an issue for me go back to the Air Force while in college, but I'm wondering if waiting until I finish a degree in computer engineering would be good enough to accomplish my goals. I felt good about being a service member, but I also found happiness in my relationship. Sometimes that happiness feels strained because I'm being pulled in two directions\-\-re\-enlisting or staying together. This sounds sort of silly as I read it, but despite that I'm hoping you all understand what I mean. Any advice would be appreciated. "

Thanks to Vancitygames for pointing out!


Hey guys,

So I've seen this everywhere online: ""CS:GO massive FPS drop with OBS open"" and it's exactly what is happening to me, but I couldn't find any fix for it. 

The proposed solution on **every forum** is ""Your PC sucks"" - ""Reduce your stream quality."" or ""Streaming + Gaming = demanding - get gudder pc"" 

And they really seem convinced- except, I am streaming games like Subnautica and Vermintide 2 which are MUCH more demanding than CS:GO and I'm running at 120-144 all the time, while streaming. Shroud had the same issue, but he doesn't talk about how he fixes it- you can hear him talking about it here: https://youtu.be/rXuZeKOIcLQ?t=114

Now if you think Shroud needs to ""upgrayd hiz pc"" I can't help you. He does seem to fix it mid game but he doesn't say how. 

My specs:

GPU: Asus 1080ti OC Edition

CPU: Watercooled 6700k OC to 4.6ghz (Performance in CS with Stream running is under 30% so it's not the CPU)

RAM: 16gb running at 2666

Stream Bitrate: 3500

Output: 720p, 60fps (and yes I've tried lowering it to 30)

My FPS is usually 300+ in CS:GO 
""But there's your problem! You're not limiting---""
Yes, I have limited my FPS to 144, 120, 165, 0, 60, everything.

""Then it must be your intern--""
Nope. 100mb fiber line, 94 down, 46 up.

Bottom line:

When OBS is open and CS is in a game capture scene, FPS **TANKS** and it is impossible that it is due to me not having a ""gudd enuf pici""

If you've heard anything useful, please let me know; I'll reiterate, I'm running far more intensive games all the time on stream and have zero issues with any of them - Shroud had the same issue, and he fixed it without relaunching the game so it couldn't be a ""Set Launch Option"" fix.

I also know of the Windows Creator update issues, but those posts seem to be from like a year or two ago; Windows has had many updates since and I'm on their newest patch. My drivers are all up to date too.

I got conditionally accepted to WUT for electrical engineering in English. I've heard that programs in English aren't very great, and I've accumulated a lot of questions that I couldn't find answers to, so I hope people here could help me out.

So, is the difference in the quality of education really big depending on what language you have your courses taught in?

Does the diploma explicitly say what language the courses are taught in as well? Or is there some sort of another difference between certificates received from courses taught in English or Polish?

Is there any way to eventually transfer from English to Polish once my language is good enough?

Is the job outlook for graduates in English a lot worse than for those who graduated in Polish? The same question goes for internships.

Does the electrical engineering have any accreditations? I've tried to look for them, but couldn't find anything.

Thank you, guys. I'm just wondering if going there is a good choice since Poland seems very interesting to me."
8m6hl6,61,2018-05-25,Your code is bad and you should feel bad about it!,HtpoHzwgBuuu,androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/8m6hl6/your_code_is_bad_and_you_should_feel_bad_about_it/,"Which beliefs or practices in your colleagues or other Android developers that you work with or read code of drives you mad, or you find at least questionable?

A place for rant, but also for serious discussion of pros and cons of habits in Android development.

So here's mine, feel free to argue:

1. **Putting each and everything into dimens.xml or colors.xml**. You have a layout, and for some reason or another, you create a margin between two buttons of 56dp. I do 

`android:layout\_margin=""56dp""`   


in the layout file and that's it. Some developers do:

`android:layout_margin=""@dimen/activity_product_details_margin_buy_button_cancel_button""`

`&lt;\dimen name=""activity_product_details_margin_buy_button_cancel_button""&gt;56dp&lt;/dimen&gt;`

the dimens.xml and link to that from their layout. What for? It's just a detour. Now if that same margin is used on another layout and it becomes your default margin between two buttons, I get it. But for these one\\\-shot kind of things ... don't see the point. Bonus points for an extra detour:

`android:layout_margin=""@dimen/activity_product_details_margin_buy_button_cancel_button""`

`&lt;dimen name=""activity_product_details_margin_buy_button_cancel_button""&gt;@dimen/very_large_margin&lt;/dimen&gt;`

`&lt;dimen name=""very_large_margin""&gt;56dp&lt;/dimen&gt;`

2. **IntDefs**. So you've watched that PerfMatters video on Youtube 5 years ago and they said enums will make your app slow and ugly and noone will want to download it. Maybe you even read an ""article"" on Medium by someone who watched the same video and felt like he needed to parrot its' content. You didn't conduct any experiments on your own, nor are you willing to accept the fact that there's loads of stuff in you app you could much more easily optimize. Screw you for making me write these horrible IntDef abominations for the sake of your premature optimization fetish. Oh, and btw: neither Android Studio nor the compiler nor any code analysis tool, to this day, enforces your precious IntDefs on any non\\\-trivial case.

3. **Copypasting from old projects**. Your company already did an app that uses an http connection to fetch stuff from an API and that code is rotting somewhere in the depths of your Git repo ... why not copy paste some of that into a fresh project? Nevermind it was written years ago by an intern, has no tests and there's tons of state\\\-of\\\-the art libs out there that do the same thing better. You go ahead, I'm not touching it should any problems arise. Very much related to ""not invented here"".

4. **Interfacing everything**. I'm going to be a bit provocative here and say that 90&amp;#37;; of interfaces created in Android code \(and probably loads of other code\) are useless. There seems to be a widespread ... not belief, but vague sentiment that interfaces make your code 'clean'. What's the purpose of an interface? a. To provide a contract on what the implementing class 'can do'. b. To make the implementations interchangable when used by another class That does make sense, but: a. That contract is often provided simply by the sum of public methods a class provides b. most interfaces are never ever interchanged. In reality, most interfaces have exactly one implementation and will never have a second one. By adding this interface you have gained nothing, except for an additional file to the project, congratulations.

Post your least favorite Android developer practices.

Edit: formatting. The new fancy pants editor is a bit weird when it comes to formatting code ..."

We’re very young and my husband just finished his masters in public health, which I was very proud of him for achieving. I am finishing my last year of residency in medical school. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately and we’ve had a lot of the same issues in the past. The kids attend daycare part time (it’s all we can afford) and I take care of the kids and have additional help from family in between my classes and clinical rotations. My husband started out as an intern working in an aquarium for free and has worked his way up to 13$/hr and 20 hrs a week. He just graduated and he wants to stay there but they currently can’t raise his hours or his pay. He’s put in other applications to other places but he wants to work for a non profit and is applying for positions that require only a bachelors and most of them pay between 25k to 40k per year but hasn’t followed up with any of them and hasn’t heard back. He told me even if he got offered a higher paying job he won’t take it because he wants to work at the aquarium. They’re very relaxed, he never comes home stressed, decides when he wants to go into work, etc. I think the low-stress aspect is nice for him but I feel that he should be reaching for a higher paying degree because he has over 40k in loans and we have 2 kids to support. I’m embarrassed to say that his parents still pay for his car insurance, phone, etc. because we can’t afford everything otherwise. Anyways, I clean the home, do the laundry, cooking, and take care of the kids on top of my schooling and clinical rotations. I’m feeling burned out and stressed over finances. I asked why he won’t consider working for a company or government where he might at least get benefits and he said because “it’s just not what he wants to do”. He wants to take out another loan for a car, which I’ve said we can’t. And in a couple years we will need to afford to buy a house as we currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment. I feel that he thinks because I’m going to be a doctor, it doesn’t matter what his income will be. It frustrates me because what was the point of taking out all these loans so that and not use his degree/field? Or why can’t he consider a higher paying job just until the kids get through middle school and we’re more financially stable and everything’s paid off and then he can work wherever? He’s also been using our money to fund his work projects which is even more frustrating to me because they barely pay him and he works more hours than he’s paid for. 

To summarize: 
- I’m burnt out from taking care of kids, cooking, cleaning, laundry and I’ve asked him to step up in his share and he always say that he will and it maybe lasts a week 
- I’m burnt out from school and I’m in a high stress career 
- he’s choosing to stay working at only 20 hrs per week 13$ an hour with no promise in increase of pay or hours. He’s not really looking at any other job. And navy has offered him 70k as industrial hygienist and he picks where he wants to work and he said no. 
- he goes to work at 8 and often is home by 2 and play video games and none of the housework is done even basic things like dishes 
- complains that I don’t have enough sex with him (minimum of twice weekly but usually 3x) and I’m just so tired 

Do you think I’m being unfair by wanting him to consider other options than just non profits? I’m getting so exhausted and I want to feel like not all of the pressure is on me and that I’m not the sole breadwinner or provider and “full time mom”. How do other spouses deal with large income gaps? When I graduate in a year I will be making a six figure salary but I don’t feel like I should have to be responsible for all finances. "

During this time of the year, the company hires interns to help out and train.

I was hired at the ALL TAX, a firm known for accounting and I was only in college sophomore year. They liked my marks and my attitude. I am sure that they only hired me because I was black. Traditionally, the company hired only college juniors. 

My first day in the office involved mainly HR and training. I hadn’t met my boss before, because I interviewed at another office and HR switched me to this location to help out with the workload.

Around 9a next morning, I met with my boss and had small meet and greet. From that point on it was smooth sailing. I caught on how to do my tasks and was adjusting fairly well. One thing that did distract me was my boss. She was a MILF and someone who loved big ass, she was perfect. We casually flirted with every change we got. 


After my first month and a half, I was asked to stay back later with my boss to work on a special project. Most of the partners would leave around 7, managers around 8 or so, but she told me I need to work until at least 9 at night. Of course I eagerly agreed, excited to be on an important client."
8m6rzl,0,2018-05-25,My (28M) girlfriend(24F) of three years wants to backpack South America solo for many months. Not sure what to do.,adventurousgf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8m6rzl/my_28m_girlfriend24f_of_three_years_wants_to/,"**Background:**

My girlfriend, ""Joan"", and I have been together for nearly three years. Ever since I've known her she's loved to travel. Hell, we met because she'd taken a summer job in my coastal city and we were long distance for a year as she went to school in Canada. Since then we've moved in together\(in a house my parents own so very low cost to us\- important later\) and taken a number of weekend trips. Our relationship is great. We have our issues but usually are able to talk them out.

**Current Issue:**

Since before we met, Joan has been daydreaming about backpacking South America. She wouldn't talk about it often, but I've always known that her goal was to get to a point in her career where she could work remotely and travel for an extended amount of time. We're both programmers and those jobs exist, they're just hard to get and nearly nonexistent at entry level so we both assumed that she wouldn't be able to make this trip until her late twenties without damage to her career prospects. Well, we were both wrong. This past year Joan was a complete badass and went from being an intern to being featured on national media for two separate hobby projects which led to a company reaching out and basically creating her dream job for her. I'm proud of her. She's been at her new, fully remote job for a couple months now and has started talking about backpacking South America. This time it's more of a plan than a daydream. She wants to leave in January and travel for 4\-5 months while working and has already started saving for it and aggressively paying off her student loans \(she could technically go now but wants a safety net for her travels\). She's invited me along \(halfheartedly, we've talked about it in the past and long term travel is not something I'm interested in\) but seems determined to go on this trip even if it means going alone. And that's where we're stuck. Neither of us wants to do long distance again but I don't want to be that jerk that says ""if you go on this trip we're breaking up"". I want her to be able to go. She's amazing and should get to do this. So that means we'll probably have to break up in January. But should we do it sooner? Is there something morbid about continuing a relationship knowing exactly when it will end?

Financially, the end of this relationship will be a lot harder on her than on me since she's the one who moved out here for me. She's offered to pack up her stuff, move out, get a storage space, whatever I want. I know it would probably cost her a lot and maybe even push back her trip. I've offered to let her keep all her stuff here while she travels. She's offered to let me use her motorcycle while she's away\(I love the thing, otherwise she'd probably sell it\). Selfishly, a part of me thinks that I could convince her not to go or convince her to still be in love with me on her trip. I know that's not a healthy mindset and probably wishful thinking. A bigger part of me thinks that it would be nice to be with her for at least a little bit longer and it's no bother to me to just put her boxes in the garage while she's gone.

She's leaving the decision up to me but says she'd like to know soon so she knows what she needs to do. I know what I want to say, but is it crazy?

TLDR: My girlfriend has always dreamed of backpacking South America. Now she can. Should we break up now or wait until she leaves in January?"

8m6y2i,4,2018-05-25,Advice about closing the distance between me [26F] and SO [26M],ldrdilemma-22,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/8m6y2i/advice_about_closing_the_distance_between_me_26f/,"Some background about us: we met 15 months ago on exchange, and we've been together as a couple for 14 months. 8 of those has been international long distance. We're not from the same continent so visits usually involve 16h+ flights, and I've made the trek for both of the visits.

Recently he had a choice between coming to my country for grad school (one of the top in the world) and a job opportunity near home. He felt the grad school route was too financially unstable so he accepted the job. Neither of us were particularly happy about the decision because it pushed our end date back another 15 months.

I'm finishing up my degree right now and have the freedom to relocate, which gives us the option to move our end date closer. However, the chances of me getting a full time regular position are low. The best chance I have is to land an internship, which will likely pay me anywhere from 10%-40% what I can make if I stay in my home country, and hope to transition to a full time position from that. Also, the area where he's currently living is extremely small town. I don't speak the local language, I've visited and didn't particularly enjoy it. It is close enough to make weekend trips to larger cities but day to day life would be less than ideal. However, I won't have to worry about housing or transportation. 

The alternative plan if I stay in my home country is to hold out for another year in this ldr and he will try to apply for a visa then, since he will have enough experience to qualify. He fully respects whatever decision I make and is not pressuring me to one or the other.

Tl;Dr - should I pause/delay my career to move to be with him?

Thoughts? Advice on surviving the long distance separation? Thanks!"

8m7uz6,1,2018-05-26,From 115 days hardmode to 0 days: 3. Lessons and a bit of my story,CL3V3L4ND,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/8m7uz6/from_115_days_hardmode_to_0_days_3_lessons_and_a/,"I've been P since 8, MO since 13. After some 7 years (nearly 5 aware of /r/NoFap), I FINALLY got to 90 days (a PR by 35 days) and then I didn't stop there nearly getting to my 120 day mark. In that time, I began working out, eating better, and using the internet less (by getting out of the house WAY more) I was in a play (wrestled social anxiety down - finally looking at people in the eyes again). I worked a seasonal gig as well as a retail gig that I got employee of the month my second month (around day 63). I drove from Cleveland to Tampa with my friends and two days later took a spontaneous trip to Chicago for a convention with a church. I then quit my jobs to take an internship at said church and follow my dreams of working on independent film and with the underprivileged. I also learned how to use parenthesis.

All this did not just come though. Work is work. Abstaining is only the start. Do not let lingering guilt make you timid. Hold your head high and get ready to go get what you want. Not by tearing others down but by building yourself up. Lift your brothers and sisters with you as you can.

3 Lessons and I'm OUT

I. Porn will always be there. 

Somehow one can fool themselves into thinking that it is not. You have a choice. It may be difficult sometimes, it may be easy sometimes, it may seem downright impossible other times. Nevertheless, you ALWAYS have a choice. I knew what I was doing.

II. Your brain's view and reaction towards it CAN change...

...if you make the proper lifestyle changes for sustained amounts of time (that's right! its a whole healthy lifestyle you ought to be after). I do not feel as if all my work is now in vain. I'm feeling motivated. Even strong. What? yes. I am right. I now know NoFap well and porn-life well. I will choose NoFap once again.

III. Its important to celebrate the mile stones as well as stay hungry. I took 90 days for granted a little bit. I should have enjoyed it more by not focusing too much on my next goal. Likewise, do not get caught in a celebration. Have your goal at hand and the next one up your sleeve.

""No sacrifice, no victory."" - The ole Witwicky Family motto

TL;DR. After 7 years, I finally got up and over 90 days. When I broke, I knew what I was doing. Keep pushing for new personal bests and progress will follow."

**5,300** people *looking at hardware gore* for  **4 Years!** 

/r/HardwareGore is the sister subreddit to /r/softwaregore. Whereas /r/softwaregore focuses on software fails and malfunctions, /r/hardwaregore is centered around problems related to hardware. 


This covers a wide variety of content, the submission may be a [fault caused by hardware issues such as a faulty GPU](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/7ylmzp/my_laptop_screens_dying/), or it may be damage to [the hardware itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/8ivivd/coffee_spilled_on_a_gpu/), as long as there's hardware, and there's gore it's accepted. The subreddit has had numerous popular submissions, with the most popular being [some food found inside a computer system](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/7vi72l/we_opened_up_a_school_computer_to_see_what_was/), and a [classic, retro battle station](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/7x4ex8/this_is_what_my_friend_actually_uses/).

As a mod there, I thought it would be a good idea to conduct an interview, so I posed the following questions to the moderators. ~~Because I don't have friends~~ I've provided my own answers to the question as some bonus reading material!

&gt;#What do you like most about the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Occlpv2**  Probably my favourite type of content here is the physical damage to objects, such as the aforementioned post with chips being found inside a computer system, or a GPU dipped in sauce. The more valuable the item, the funnier!

&gt;&gt;**/u/IwataFan** It’s a great resource for seeing all the different ways hardware fails us (or we fail it). It can be really funny to see all the ways people manage to mess hardware up. Plus, being damage-prone myself, I find many of the posts here very relatable.


&gt;##What is the biggest challenge you think the subreddit faces?

&gt;&gt;**/u/IwataFan**  Our main priority right now is to help and grow the community, primarily by finding unique content. We are very excited about the future of r/HardwareGore, as it is growing fast!

&gt;&gt;**/u/Occlpv2**  Probably sustaining the recent growth we've had, and keeping the submission quality high and relevant to the subreddit. Generally subreddit quality and there subscriber count are inversely proportional after a certain point, so we're trying to be the exception to the rule.


&gt;Speaking of growing fast, how do you feel about the recent growth?

&gt;&gt;**/u/IwataFan**  It has been very exciting for the community and for our team to see how fast the subreddit has grown! We are getting a lot of great content, which I think is drawing people in. Our hope is that, with more people being a part of the community, we will see more and more awesome posts, so the future is looking very bright for the subreddit!

&gt;&gt;**/u/Occlpv2**  Delighted! I'm glad so many people are enjoying our content.

####/r/hardwaregore

**5,300** people *looking at hardware gore* for  **4 Years!** 

/r/HardwareGore is the sister subreddit to /r/softwaregore. Whereas /r/softwaregore focuses on software fails and malfunctions, /r/hardwaregore is centered around problems related to hardware. 


This covers a wide variety of content, the submission may be a [fault caused by hardware issues such as a faulty GPU](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/7ylmzp/my_laptop_screens_dying/), or it may be damage to [the hardware itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/8ivivd/coffee_spilled_on_a_gpu/), as long as there's hardware, and there's gore it's accepted. The subreddit has had numerous popular submissions, with the most popular being [some food found inside a computer system](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/7vi72l/we_opened_up_a_school_computer_to_see_what_was/), and a [classic, retro battle station](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwaregore/comments/7x4ex8/this_is_what_my_friend_actually_uses/).

As a mod there, I thought it would be a good idea to conduct an interview, so I posed the following questions to the moderators. ~~Because I don't have friends~~ I've provided my own answers to the question as some bonus reading material!

&gt;#What do you like most about the subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Occlpv2**  Probably my favourite type of content here is the physical damage to objects, such as the aforementioned post with chips being found inside a computer system, or a GPU dipped in sauce. The more valuable the item, the funnier!

&gt;&gt;**/u/IwataFan** It’s a great resource for seeing all the different ways hardware fails us (or we fail it). It can be really funny to see all the ways people manage to mess hardware up. Plus, being damage-prone myself, I find many of the posts here very relatable.


&gt;##What is the biggest challenge you think the subreddit faces?

&gt;&gt;**/u/IwataFan**  Our main priority right now is to help and grow the community, primarily by finding unique content. We are very excited about the future of r/HardwareGore, as it is growing fast!

&gt;&gt;**/u/Occlpv2**  Probably sustaining the recent growth we've had, and keeping the submission quality high and relevant to the subreddit. Generally subreddit quality and there subscriber count are inversely proportional after a certain point, so we're trying to be the exception to the rule.


&gt;Speaking of growing fast, how do you feel about the recent growth?

&gt;&gt;**/u/IwataFan**  It has been very exciting for the community and for our team to see how fast the subreddit has grown! We are getting a lot of great content, which I think is drawing people in. Our hope is that, with more people being a part of the community, we will see more and more awesome posts, so the future is looking very bright for the subreddit!

&gt;&gt;**/u/Occlpv2**  Delighted! I'm glad so many people are enjoying our content.

8m9t39,51,2018-05-26,Well...I'm gay and was an Islamic Studies Teacher. What do I do now?,Jaaxn,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/8m9t39/wellim_gay_and_was_an_islamic_studies_teacher/,"I've been reading posts from outside of the Reddit\-verse for a while now but I have officially joined the family. Just a bit of info about myself before I share my story; I'm 21 and living up north in Canada coming from an extremely cultured and religious family and upbringing.  Alright, lets begin lol:

Do you ever feel out of place?  Sometimes I feel like I’m always on the outside, there’s this invisible line that I have to cross to really be a part of everything and I just can’t ever cross it. Don't get me wrong, I love talking and chilling with my friends and family but I sometimes I feel like i'm on the outside. I feel like I've been holding my breathe for the past couple of years and now, I don't even recognize myself....I used to be so carefree and enjoyed life.

I've always been religious for the longest I can remember. In middle school, every other boy was talking to girls and dating but not me because I thought I had more Taqwa \(piety\) than them and feared Allah more. Little did I know, it had nothing to do with that. This perceived piety later led me to go to Islamic School \(willingly\) and start my journey into conservative Islamic theology, which is  where I started memorizing Qu'ran, some Ahaddeth as well as some works from some Islamic scholars in Arabic. I later became an Isalmic Studies teacher at a well\-known Masjid while still in High\-school until I quit earlier this year after realizing that I'm a hypocrite.

I guess you could say I always knew subconsciously that I'm gay but If I could point out a moment I knew. It would have to be one time in my final year of high\-school when I was walking in the hallway in\-between classes and  a senior named Hayden walked passed me and I  subconsciously turned around checked out his ass and was like ""Crap! I'm Gay""\(True story lol\).  I ignored that thought and started to pray more, went to Umrah, deleted my social media, started reading Qu'ran more and spent time with my friends from the masjid that would remind me of Allah.

Fast Forward a couple of years, right now, I'm in my third year of university and holy crap have I changed. I quit my job at the Masjid, made new friends outside of the masjid, started listening to Music and started question everything. Naturally,  I always was a critically thinker and would question everything but the deen was off\-limits until recently.

That thought that came to my head when Hayden walked by me in the hallway came back and instead of ignoring it and saying that it was a result of lack of being religious. I started questioning it and eventually started questioning my beliefs in Islam. Started to ask questions like why did Allah create me with same\-sex attractions while at the same time he's telling  me its not natural? If this is a test, am I supposed to be alone my whole life? Isn't that a cruel test from the All\-Merciful? Even if I  do accept this as a test from Allah, am I supposed to marry a girl that I don't love? And yes, majority of scholars say that you should fast, pray, make Du'a and marry a woman but is that fair? Can you even pray the Gay away?

I have never in my wildest life thought I would contemplate suicide but I have. I thought how could I live in the closet forever or be unfair to another human being and marry her because it's the 'right' thing to do . However,  I thought Suicide is far better than living a life of homosexuality and far better than your family and friends cutting you off.

So here I am, just staying up and typing this after I just finished eating my suhoor and praying salatul\-Fajr. It's not that I'm upset with the religion nor have I left \(somethings do make sense to me in Islam\). At this moment, Its just hard for me to swallow that a God that I have learned to love and worship for so long would test me in such a cruel way. You may call me naive or that I am the  result of a long process of indoctrination but in a twisted way I still believe. Do I think I can live alone and stay in the closet forever? No.  Do I think there is a possibility that I am an bisexual and could marry a girl? What if I'm not a bisexual? Isn't that selfish on my part and unfair to the girl?

For the pass couple of months I have been just focusing on my school, my upcoming internship this summer and spending as much time with my family and friends \(even the ones from the masjid\) before my gayness drags my ass across that invisible line or my time to clock\-out of this world comes.

I'm not upset nor am I angry, I just feel like my world just flipped upside down, drastically. I was super religious to the point I would lower my gaze, read and listen to lectures non\-stop, was even an Islamic Teacher and now I am posting my one HUGE ass gay secret and my doubt of my religion to strangers.  How the tables have turned LOOL.

Sorry for the long post but thanks for the read. I had to share that with somebody, why not the internet? LOOOL"
8ma4v8,4,2018-05-26,What can I (18f) do to support my boyfriend (19m) 2 years during stressful times?,NegativeBookshop,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ma4v8/what_can_i_18f_do_to_support_my_boyfriend_19m_2/,"My boyfriend has been going through a plethora of stressful events recently. He expressed that he finds university overwhelming, anxious about an upcoming internship, disappointed because he's not seeing results at gym, a relative passed away recently, among others. With university exams coming up in around 2 weeks time it's not helping either


In the past 2-3 months I've started noticing some behaviour from him that I recognised from when I went through my own dips in mental health(apathetic, lack of motivation, diminished appetite). They're not major, and 95% of the time he's his usual self, but I'm worried the 5% will slowly start to get bigger.

We live roughly 2 hours on public transport away, so we mainly see each other on weekdays where we can meet up after classes. I try my best to remind him I support him and I'll be with him to get through all this, but I can't help but feel lost as to what I really should be doing to help. Any advice is appreciated.


**tldr;** boyfriend is going through a stressful time, lost as to how to support him"

8mbyxz,52,2018-05-26,"My mother, a rant, and what's your opinion:",MikaylaTheScrub,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/8mbyxz/my_mother_a_rant_and_whats_your_opinion/,"When I was about 5/6 years old, my mom flipped and took my dad to court. They've been separated before that and they would split everything 50/50. Time, money, clothes, everything. My dad worked nights, so, when I was at his place, my aunt or uncles would watch me, and Dad would take me to school in the morning. 

One morning, my dad didn't take me to school cause he was exhausted from the day before. My mom was calling and calling him, but he didn't pick up (he was sleeping). She eventually drove to his house and she started yelling at him, calling him irresponsible and stuff, and then, she pulled it. She told him she was going to take him to court. They did. I remember going to the courthouses and waiting in some kind of day-care for kids, while their parents were with the judge. My dad became suicidal, the fact that he could lose his only kid, the daughter he loves so much, made him want to harm himself. Mom found out, told the judge. The judge said he had to be put under protection when I was with him so, he wouldn't hurt me or himself. My dad also drank a lot, so he was ordered to go to AA meetings. We had to see each other under protection. My dad didn't want some random ass person to watch us be together. (The movie Mrs. Doubtfire comes to mind) Not to mention, Dad worked nights and the judge ordered that HE had to watch me and not my aunt or uncles, so, since age 6, I've only seen him on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th weekends of each month. 

Anyways, he fought in court to make the witness my grandmother and great grandmother. So majority of my childhood was spent at my grandma's house when I was with Dad. I never noticed before, until he told me recently. He and my mom would go back and forth in court, my dad didn't have that good of a job so, money was always tight and he was mostly always spending it in court to get some freedom. Eventually, around 8 years old, he stopped fighting. 

My mom is a lesbian. When I was 6, we moved in with her girlfriend and her son, who was a year younger than me. My dad found out that I was forced to share a room with the son (who I will call 🅱) and said that it was illegal for 2 kids who were unrelated to share a room and he said if he really wanted to, he could've called CPS. But, since parents have an unwritten rule of ""Don't call CPS, unless some crazy shit happens."" So, Dad didn't call them. 

🅱 was insane. He had behavior problems and would yell and scream, he would hit and hurt people and me. My mom was so wrapped up in love, all she would do is tell him to calm down and if he did get too insane she would tell her girlfriend to get him checked out and the girlfriend always denied it, saying ""oh he's just being a boy."" 🅱 would hit me and yell at me, we were always arguing, and he started majority of em. Mom would always tell me to stop fighting and just accept it. Mom was.. so fucking wrapped up in love, she didn't do jackshit. 🅱 would force me to undress at night and play games with him, naked. When my mom and dad found out, they made it seem like it was my fault, that I started it, that I wanted to play naked games. Ever since that event, I felt like I could *never* talk to my parents about sex or anything related to sex. 

Fast forwards to years and years in the future. I was 14. My mom's dated and broke up with many women. My mom's engaged to a girl named A. A had a daughter who was older. That one year when they were engaged was the best year of my life. I didn't have a lot of friends and all my socializing was online. I had made a small group of online friends (who I love and adore to this day). I would isolate myself in room, playing games, talking to my friends, watching TV, drawing, everything. And you bet when Pokemon Go came out, I was going outside as often as I could. 

I started high school, I was one of those freshmen who dated seniors. I dated one, who had just turned 17, that August, I was turning 15 in November. Mom said, I wasn't allowed to date anyone until I was 16. I wanted to see what it was like, dating someone older, I wanted to see if it was something I liked or not. I was trying to figure out myself. We never did anything sexual. Mom and Dad found out about the relationship. They broke us up. (which was extremely good, now that I think about it, he was a white supremacist) Around this time, my parents found out about my online friends, and to be honest, I wouldn't have been grounded for that long if I didn't have online friends. They banned me from my own laptop, they took my phone away and I was basically alone and friendless from months September-February. I eventually met my current group of friends at school. They're all great people, however, because of my sexual curiosity, I make several people hate each other and not be friends. 

June of 2017, I finally finished my first year of high school, 2 boys liked me. 1 was graduating, the other was about to be a senior the following school year. I decided to start dating the graduating one, and that made a split in the friend group. People called me a whore, a slut, they said I was manipulative, a THOT. My mom found out about my (sexual) relationship with the graduating boy. He had turned 18 that May, I was 15 and a half. She told my dad, Dad threatened to call the cops. They didn't, but all my stuff was taken away. That was mom's idea, but, she sold my phone, gave my 3ds to my dad, who said he was gonna sell it (but ended up giving it back to me). My mom sold my Wii U, my Wii games (which I bought some). Mom has every right to sell my phone and Wii U, but I bought those games with my own money, so, she took my belongings and got rid of them. I tried talking to her about that a few months after the incident, but she yelled at me, said I don't own anything in *her* house. All my clothes, stuffed animals, art supplies, everything, pfft I don't own them. They are all her's and I'm apparently ""lucky"" that she didn't go and sell the rest of my belongings. She said I had to buy my own phone and that I needed a job for that (I intern and don't get paid). I ended up getting my own phone within 2 weeks of getting my stuff taken away and it's what I'm using now to type this out. 

I remember one time when I told my dad that I was sexually assaulted in middle school, he was supportive and told me everything was going to be alright. When I told my mom, she already knew from my dad and instead of being supportive, she yelled at me, said ""This is why we can have nice things, you hide everything and don't tell us anything, (she brought up an incident when I called my friend and it was being picked up from the camera she installed in our living room and said I hide things from her. All I was going was talking to my best friend about a story). I said she tends to overreact so that's why I don't tell her anything, but, she didn't like that, and of course she overreacts more and yells at me. 

I love my mom, but, I love my dad more. My dad has acknowledged that when I'm older I'll be seeing and hanging out with him more than my mom. I've had the option to choose who I wanted to live with since I was 10. Now, I'm 16 and half. I ask Dad if I can live with him and he's 100% on board, however, everytime he tries to talk to Mom, she yells at him and says ""I don't want her to sneak around and lie at your house, I don't want (My dad's new girlfriend) to raise Mikayla, I don't want her to replace me, I don't want another woman in Mikayla's life.""

My mom is a good person, I think. She a good person, but, everytime I share the bad stuff about her, I always see myself defending her actions. About the graduating boy mentioned earlier, we were told not to see each other or he would be put in jail. We have a normal emotional relationship. We've been on and off, but, we've always tried to stay there for each other. We recently been given permission to see each other again, so, hopefully, things can be back to normal. We're coming up on 1 year together. 

...Sorry for this being *really* long. I don't like r/RBN, and maybe other teenagers can tell me if I'm overreacting about everything. Sorry if this doesn't belong here, I just.. need to get this off my chest. "
8mbz4o,17,2018-05-26,"My mother, a rant, and what's your opinion?",MikaylaTheScrub,teenagersnew,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagersnew/comments/8mbz4o/my_mother_a_rant_and_whats_your_opinion/,"When I was about 5/6 years old, my mom flipped and took my dad to court. They've been separated before that and they would split everything 50/50. Time, money, clothes, everything. My dad worked nights, so, when I was at his place, my aunt or uncles would watch me, and Dad would take me to school in the morning. 

One morning, my dad didn't take me to school cause he was exhausted from the day before. My mom was calling and calling him, but he didn't pick up (he was sleeping). She eventually drove to his house and she started yelling at him, calling him irresponsible and stuff, and then, she pulled it. She told him she was going to take him to court. They did. I remember going to the courthouses and waiting in some kind of day-care for kids, while their parents were with the judge. My dad became suicidal, the fact that he could lose his only kid, the daughter he loves so much, made him want to harm himself. Mom found out, told the judge. The judge said he had to be put under protection when I was with him so, he wouldn't hurt me or himself. My dad also drank a lot, so he was ordered to go to AA meetings. We had to see each other under protection. My dad didn't want some random ass person to watch us be together. (The movie Mrs. Doubtfire comes to mind) Not to mention, Dad worked nights and the judge ordered that HE had to watch me and not my aunt or uncles, so, since age 6, I've only seen him on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th weekends of each month. 

Anyways, he fought in court to make the witness my grandmother and great grandmother. So majority of my childhood was spent at my grandma's house when I was with Dad. I never noticed before, until he told me recently. He and my mom would go back and forth in court, my dad didn't have that good of a job so, money was always tight and he was mostly always spending it in court to get some freedom. Eventually, around 8 years old, he stopped fighting. 

My mom is a lesbian. When I was 6, we moved in with her girlfriend and her son, who was a year younger than me. My dad found out that I was forced to share a room with the son (who I will call 🅱) and said that it was illegal for 2 kids who were unrelated to share a room and he said if he really wanted to, he could've called CPS. But, since parents have an unwritten rule of ""Don't call CPS, unless some crazy shit happens."" So, Dad didn't call them. 

🅱 was insane. He had behavior problems and would yell and scream, he would hit and hurt people and me. My mom was so wrapped up in love, all she would do is tell him to calm down and if he did get too insane she would tell her girlfriend to get him checked out and the girlfriend always denied it, saying ""oh he's just being a boy."" 🅱 would hit me and yell at me, we were always arguing, and he started majority of em. Mom would always tell me to stop fighting and just accept it. Mom was.. so fucking wrapped up in love, she didn't do jackshit. 🅱 would force me to undress at night and play games with him, naked. When my mom and dad found out, they made it seem like it was my fault, that I started it, that I wanted to play naked games. Ever since that event, I felt like I could *never* talk to my parents about sex or anything related to sex. 

Fast forwards to years and years in the future. I was 14. My mom's dated and broke up with many women. My mom's engaged to a girl named A. A had a daughter who was older. That one year when they were engaged was the best year of my life. I didn't have a lot of friends and all my socializing was online. I had made a small group of online friends (who I love and adore to this day). I would isolate myself in room, playing games, talking to my friends, watching TV, drawing, everything. And you bet when Pokemon Go came out, I was going outside as often as I could. 

I started high school, I was one of those freshmen who dated seniors. I dated one, who had just turned 17, that August, I was turning 15 in November. Mom said, I wasn't allowed to date anyone until I was 16. I wanted to see what it was like, dating someone older, I wanted to see if it was something I liked or not. I was trying to figure out myself. We never did anything sexual. Mom and Dad found out about the relationship. They broke us up. (which was extremely good, now that I think about it, he was a white supremacist) Around this time, my parents found out about my online friends, and to be honest, I wouldn't have been grounded for that long if I didn't have online friends. They banned me from my own laptop, they took my phone away and I was basically alone and friendless from months September-February. I eventually met my current group of friends at school.

I live in the US and am currently a college student. I have this fantastic stylist near my college campus that I always go to, but this summer I have a 3 month internship in a faraway state and NEED my roots done (a finance job, so looking ""professional"" is necessary). I'm a natural level 3-4 and my hair is currently at a level 9, so root upkeep is super important for me as they become ugly quickly (+ the brassiness of course).

Anyways, I've had horror stories of stylists in other state's messing up my hair when I'm on break, so my regular stylist offered to write up her formula and that I take it to a salon near my internship. I did just that and the owner told me that she'll fulfill my request only this time, but that this isn't normally done, the stylist needs freedom to figure out your hair themselves, etc. I understand where she's coming from, but I've had so much miscommunication with other stylists that I thought something written would be best.

Is bringing a stylist a formula looked down on? Did I start us out on the completely wrong foot?"

Sure she has her ups and downs but I didn’t like how her character evolved.

After her internship, Mitchum is honest with her about her prospects albeit in an obnoxious way.. but she overreacts and steals a yacht with Logan. A YACHT!!!
But somehow it makes it all ok because she was in a bad mood. Lorelai’s reaction to this in the car frustrates me. She doesn’t address Rory’s actions but instead goes on a rant about Mitchum. (Whilst Kirk just about tows their car!) Correct, it’s only one man’s opinion but suck it up Rory!

Same when Richard confronted Mitchum in the bathroom at the DAR event. Why can’t Rory or any member of the family handle criticism of her? I agree that the Hunztbergers were rude to Rory at the dinner but the internship was different.

I disliked how Rory was always put on the pedestal even before she reached her accomplishments.
Now watching the revival was Mitchum somehow right in saying she “doesn’t have it”?"

We have gone through quite a lot together, finally reaching a point where we've gotten past different forms of relationship drama \(my family's disapproval due to cultural differences\). Everything has been great, but we are attending different colleges that are about \~2\-3 hours away. We are also both insanely busy with school, work, hanging with friends. We usually see each other once every 3\-4 weeks for a weekend, and when we're together everything is great. We will both be home for the summer.

Normally, we would talk every day by text or phone calls and maybe skype 2\-3 times a week. There was actually a point a point where I was feeling a bit overwhelmed by how much attention he needed from me \(but also secretly liked it because it made me feel important to him\).

The problem is that now that my semester has been winding down, he is heading into finals/planning his internship for the summer. He has been extremely busy \(understandably\) and all we can do is text sporadically throughout the day. Although I know that he is busy, it upsets me that we haven't been able to talk on the phone or skype in the past few weeks \(I hate talking by text and I prefer talking to someone in person or hearing their voice\).

Long story short, a huge argument led to him saying that I'm requiring too much attention, that I should understand that he's busy. My response is that it doesn't take much to call someone for 5 minutes once or twice a week, or even to just send a quick ""hey I'm gonna be busy today"" text. I feel like I'm low on his priority list, and that he only gives me attention when he isn't busy. This scares me because as we get older, we are only going to get busier and I don't want to be in a relationship where we can't make each other a priority. Him rejecting me has pushed us apart a bit, and I'm worried that my feelings for him have changed.

At the same time, I do have a tendency to be dramatic and overreact so that could what's happening as well. What can I do? Should I just give it time?"

I need advice regarding how long time will be enough too see most of Reykjavik, whale safari perhaps, but also rent a car and go north/east and explore the rest of the Iceland (golden tour but with rental instead of the busses maybe?..

Is it possible to combine airBNB and bring a backpacking set &amp; tent when traveling east or should I do daytrips and return back to Reykjavik at the end of the day? Does it take a long time to go around the whole iceland?
 How are the prices there, food drinks etc? Will 5 days be enough to see most of the mentioned above? How will the weather be during September?

I'm really grateful for any answers to above mentioned questions, or any insights/guidance you can give me overall. Thanks in advance, cheers! :)

8mcxmo,4,2018-05-26,My boyfriend (M/23) of a year just broke up with me (F/21),rose_goes97,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8mcxmo/my_boyfriend_m23_of_a_year_just_broke_up_with_me/,"So as the title describes, my boyfriend, let's call him Ed, ended things. Just to describe how things were, they were rocky. I went into this relationship way too soon and I was afraid of being alone after my ex, let's say Alex, and I called things after dating for 3 years. I broke up with my ex, and jumped into another one that just ended. 

Last summer, after only dating Ed for a couple months and being exclusive, I made the massive mistake of drunk texting Alex. Ed found out by seeing the notifications from my phone and ended things. After a while we tried to go out again and I thought things were good. But I could tell I really hurt Ed and I just thought we could work through it. 

In the past year we have fought a lot, and he constantly would bring up that I drunk texted alex and that I said I was single\- even though I was not. I still beat myself up about it and I really do think what I did was the worst thing. I was grateful for Ed giving me a second chance. But after so many fights and never fully gaining his trust, thing just were never the same since when we first started dating. 

I got an internship miles away, and Ed is graduating from college this fall. We talked about doing long distance and he seemed worried and that we were forcing it. But I convinced him to try and we went along thinking things were okay. Today he called and said things weren't working out and he just can't trust me. He doesn't know if I'm texting my old ex Alex. and I really don't blame Ed for feeling the way he does. 

I guess my question is, how do you move on from someone that you really love and care about but know that there was too much wrong with the relationship for it to work out? I feel awful for drunk texting my ex, and I know I need to be single for a while. I just feel guilty about ruining a relationship that could have ended a lot differently if I hadn't messed up so bad.

8md3uj,1,2018-05-26,"More lost than ever after college; I don't know who I am anymore, I have no friends or sense of identity.",thegreenestguy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8md3uj/more_lost_than_ever_after_college_i_dont_know_who/,"The title is self explanatory, also sorry for a long story. I feel like the background to my vent helps explain how I got to this position and my feelings on it. I've broken it up for easy reading. 

**Here's the background:** I started by going to a small college unsure of whether or not I wanted to get an art degree due to my original ideas coming out of high school. I always wanted to do film and spent most of my time in high school exploring this path, I was part of the high school's arts program so I gained a lot of experience with this. In this small college I became really lonely and depressed, not enjoying the college itself and realized I wanted to do science instead. So I transferred colleges after my freshman year and made a lot of friends in my new dorm at the new college. I also at the time got into a pretty on and off again relationship. I cultivated this life in the dorm and returned the next year with a stronger role in the community and I felt like I had really found my place. I was super social and had a large network of friends at this time. 

Toward the end of this time I officially ended the on and off again relationship with the guy I met from the dorm (for reasons) and moved out of the dorm and lived off campus, closer to my classes. Then I met my current boyfriend and it was amazing. Seeing how he interacted with his housemates and his attitude about life in general really changed me. Unfortunately at the same time my now ex had some issues letting go (we wavered between friends and dating for a long time and he wanted to be ""friends"" again), so I had to go full no contact. This strained my relationships with everyone from the dorm because he was a centerpiece to a lot of my social groups or had been introduced to my friend groups through me and got close to them through that. Basically my social groups from the dorm evaporated because either they graduated or it was too awkward/strained to continue while avoiding my ex. While this was happening in the background my new relationship was off to a rocky start mostly because I had really awful drinking habits but I got my act together and to add more spinning plates I made it through one of the hardest academic years I ever had. I was basically just going to class and hanging out with my boyfriend when I had the time. It was honestly fantastic and the improvement in my gpa over the course of this year made me wanna cry. I even thought to myself when I was recently looking over my transcript who is this person even who got such garbage grades at the beginning of my time at this college?! 

Needless to say my standards overall went up like crazy and I felt like I was really successful. My life was on the upswing again, I had my boyfriend, good grades, and I felt like I was getting a real handle on what I wanted to do after graduation. Although I had lost most of my friends from the dorm, I was living the adultish life and getting through college. By the end of this year a lot of my friends graduated along with my boyfriend, and I was not because of my prior academic missteps. I would have to stay a year later but it didn't really matter to me because I was getting a degree in a field I loved and I was even working in a summer job that was similar to what I wanted to do! I moved further from campus this year with my previous housemates and everything was great! Because my boyfriend got accepted to a grad school halfway across the country we would be long distance which was daunting but I knew we could make it through it. 

I managed to get a job on campus in the fall and between that and a full course load including some internships for credit I really didn't have time for a social life. This was fine to me but this also happened during the spring. Fast foreword to this May I basically graduated alone with my family watching but at the same time I was really proud of the accomplishment and know that this was my overall goal that led me to meet these people through the years, not the other way around. So I was happy but definitely feeling the isolation. 

**Here's my main issue:** Now I'm graduated and working in the same old summer job that I have been for the last two summers. I'm set up to move in with my boyfriend in August but until then I'm stuck waiting here unable to do much besides work during the day and look for jobs over there after work. I've been reading some books to help with my anxiety and one of them really made me take pause and evaluate what kind of life I'm living and who I am as a person. I realized I don't even know who I am anymore, I feel like I went into college with some sense of who I thought I was but after all of this stuff and reinvention and loss and what I think is success, I feel so hollow almost. It's like I've been building a house for years after years of obsessing over it's blueprints and landscaping it's finally complete, and I'm just sitting on the porch like ""What do I do now? I have this and love it but don't know what to do with it or if anyone wants it and I don't even have a job in town or anything besides this damn house!"" It's like being released from prison or coming out of a coma, what do I do now?? I'm living with my parents for now without any hobbies besides watching tv and playing video games and I can't make any commitments because I'm moving in August. I've been trying to start a cardio routine to prevent myself from falling into a slump during this rough time. It sounds silly but a coworker asked me what I've been watching recently and since I put that to the side for finals I haven't really been watching anything so I was actually at a loss for words! That's so crazy to me! I think this is a good time to go through this identity crisis or whatever this is and have space to figure myself out but I don't even know where to start. I feel paralyzed between not wanting to waste time on something consumptive like watching tv and not knowing what I want to do with my time after work. 

**TL;DR:** Recent college graduate asking how do you find yourself? How do you figure out what you do or don't like? How do you know what you want to do outside of work? I have no idea how I'm supposed to find out what things I enjoy or should be spending my time on outside of work. "
8mdejf,2,2018-05-26,Depressive Episode Triggered by an Arrest :/ (long post I'm sorry),princessdirtbunnyy,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/8mdejf/depressive_episode_triggered_by_an_arrest_long/,"Content Warning: drugs

I know that a lot of people who have BP have run-ins with the law so I thought I'd ask a few questions about it to see if anybody here has some insight, as well as some possible coping mechanisms regarding the situation.

So I’m the bipolar partner, but my partner (J) recently got arrested. Our school's public safety officers searched them the called the cops. They found weed in his room, which was his, but his roommate (C) had 4 other harder drugs in the room that were not my partner's. I have substance abuse issues (but I've been sober for over a year now thankfully), and my partner refuses to do anything other than smoke and do psychs because of it. When p-safe first found the harder stuff, C said they were his, and then told the cops when they showed up. However, they’re both being charged for the same thing right now because of the way my state's possession laws work; one of the charges is a felony only a class below first degree murder, and they're being charged with selling since there were so many things in the room.

I’m not in contact with C, but J’s current (the first he's been offered) plea deal is two years in prison IF C officially exonerates him of the harder drug charges. When J contacted C about the plea deal he got and asked him what he was planning to do, all C said was ""my lawyer told me not to talk to you."" J has a public defender and C has a private attorney; we're getting a little nervous about what the attorney and C's parents are pushing him to do. 

So here's where I have a couple legal questions. I totally get that nobody can ever know for sure, I'm just wondering if anybody here has any similar situational experience. Any of y'all been arrested for drugs? Either just possession or selling? Did you have to do prison time? Outside of drug charges, what were y'all's experiences with the prosecutor and plea deals? I've been trying to do research, but I'm really confused and none of it is really straight forward or understandable to me because I've never been arrested or anything before. 

Okay now onto the coping mechanisms questions. This situation is killing me. We go to college together (well used to, he had to leave when he got arrested). We've been together since our freshman year. For 2 years, we basically lived together, slept together almost every single night. He knows me better than anybody else, has stood by me through everything, knows how to help during depressive and (hypo)manic episodes, and is just such a rock. Now, he had to go back to his home state to work to try and save money for whatever fees and fines he's going to be hit with after this as well as to have somewhere to live. We're now long distance. Learning to sleep by myself has been horrible; I have nightmares a lot, have always had trouble falling/staying asleep, and I have fibromyalgia and pressure from another person's body can help alleviate the pain at night. Aside from that, I just miss him. He's my best friend. His court date isn't until September, so we have to wait months to even find out what to expect for the future. 

This not knowing is killing us both, and I’m just spiraling down. I can barely get out of bed and I can’t stop crying and I just feel so dark and empty and achy. Everything seems so hopeless. At first, it was just because of the situation. I know that mourning over this is normal. However, I know myself and the reality of the depression that I'm feeling is going beyond that; it's getting in the way of my ability to function as a human being. The thought of having to go to my internship exhausts me and more than once I've considered quitting. I was rapid cycling for about 2 years (had episodes that lasted a month or longer with only a few weeks in between), and it's finally started slowing down; it's been awhile since I've had a depressive episode. Now, I'm scared I'm going to start cycling again, though I know that's probably not the case.

Does anybody have tips on how to deal with external situations that are contributing to the episodes? Before now, everything has pretty much been internal. I've learned how to deal with that kind of stuff, at least somewhat. Now, though, things actually do suck. Everything might actually fall apart. Our future together, and his future in particular, might actually be ruined. I'm so sad, and it's completely understandable to people who don't get mental illness. However, it's become more than just sadness. It feels like the depressive episode I had last year that almost ended my life. I can't see any hope, I can't tell myself it'll be okay, I can't look forward to the future. What can I do to cope with this?"
8mdtfv,2,2018-05-26,My [23 M] gf [22 F] thinks I have unresolved feelings for my ex,DumpsterPhoenix,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8mdtfv/my_23_m_gf_22_f_thinks_i_have_unresolved_feelings/,"LONGPOST warning; skip details to PROBLEM

So I've been with my gf for ~3.5 months now, and I feel as if I'm absolutely enamored by this girl.

How we got together:
We met ~ 6 months ago when she had been dating (not bf/gf) another guy for a few months. I wasn't really looking for anything because I'd gotten out of a bad relationship earlier that year and really was looking to just focus on myself in terms of health, career, friendships/family, etc. We just started hanging out as friends initially, but it got to a point to where we were 'basically dating' and that other guy was essentially out of the picture -  hanging out every weekend, checking daily to see if we were going to meet up (usually the answer was yes), going out of our ways to make time for each other, and even checking each others hand temperatures for extended periods of time with interlocking fingers. I feel like I'm as oblivious as it gets when it comes to things like this and tend to second-guess myself a lot, so it seems to me a miracle that we even ended up in a committed relationship together, but I couldn't be happier about how things worked out.

How we interact:
We still look to spend almost every day together, eating food, going shopping, just hanging out, etc., basically looking for any excuse to spend time with one another because we enjoy each other's company a lot. I think she's hilarious and we act like idiots when we're together. She's easily become my best friend and someone I feel incredibly close with and I feel as if I can depend on to be there for me. We both have been living in our parents homes (~30 minute drive without traffic). We handwrite letters to one another to explain our feelings over sometimes complex situations or just to show appreciation of the other.

More context about us as individuals and our past (everybody's got one)

Me: I lived in the same city for pretty much my entire life except for the 4 years I spent away at University and doing various internships. When I was 14, I asked my first girlfriend out (we'll call her Alice) and we were together throughout all of high school. We had a great relationship but broke up before I left for college (largely my decision because of the distance). After a somewhat elongated breakup / fwb situation / recovery process that truly ended ~7 months after we broke up (of which I could go into further detail if need be), Alice and I have been able to maintain contact in a healthy/platonic sense. I had a quick relationship my first semester of college that I cut off because I wasn't over Alice at the time or ready to be in a relationship and it wasn't fair to either of us. I was also in a serious relationship for ~18 months during university before things became toxic about halfway through and we finally broke up during my last semester. I recently moved back to my parents home after getting my bachelor's degree where I have been living until I met my gf.

My gf: She's lived in the same city for as me for her entire life. She had a couple of crushes that turned into quick boyfriends (~1-2 month long affairs) during high school, a high school romance similar to mine, and then a more recent relationship with someone she had been long-term friends (we'll call him Mark) with that turned bad/abusive and ended a few months after my own toxic relationship earlier in 2017. After her breakup with Mark, she had a few flings with a few other guys as well as a fwb situation with Mark that she cut off a few months before we got together. She doesn't maintain much contact with any of these people, but she did tell me she has tried to set up contact with Mark during the course of our relationship (as friends), and I really do trust her. We both have a lot of friends of the opposite sex. She's done a lot for me already that she never did in previous relations.

PROBLEM
My gf feels threatened and thinks that I might have unresolved feelings for Alice. Alice and I don't talk that much anymore really. I saw her once around the time I started hanging out with my gf as friends when she was visiting (she moved away to a different state with her current boyfriend), and we texted a few times when she was dealing with some difficult circumstances in her own life. I'm pretty open about how I'm still friends with Alice, and even showed my gf texts we send and told her about things that Alice would tell me she's going with. One time I was telling my gf a story about how Alice and the girl from my toxic relationship met because we were all abroad in the same foreign country/city together (which actually went pretty badly in hindsight), and mentioned how one day my gf would probably meet Alice as well. She became pretty cold with me and talked about how that made her really uncomfortable and was having second thoughts about us. She explained that her own parents have a situation where things look pretty grim and they might split due to cheating, and she doesn't want to have a situation like that happen to her, which is fair. We ended up reconciling and things seemed to be great again.

Since I've been back, my parents have been trying to retire and to do so they need to move to a different area. I'm staying due to a new job that I've been working at and am actually moving to an area to be closer to both work and my gf. In the process, I've been having to go through all of the things that I've had growing up and deciding what's worth keeping vs. throwing away. It turns out, being in a relationship with Alice for ~4 years accumulated a lot of memorabilia (love letters, gifts, pictures, etc.) that was sort of hidden throughout the room. I don't really have anything up from my relationship with Alice but my mom keeps our prom picture up in the hallway (I've actually tried to cover it with a different picture from prom with a group photo of my friends for my gf's sake but my mom keeps putting it back up smh) I've re-read through a lot of them and decided to keep a good deal of it in one of my drawers because I'm a sentimental person. In that drawer, I've also organized a bunch of letters and notes from my other friends and family along with yearbooks and things I've decided are valuable to me on a very personal level, especially when it feels like there's a high amount of thought and care put into them. It's also where I store letters I've gotten from my current gf, for the record. Stuff like that is irreplaceable. I don't live in the past, but I'd be lying if I said that my relationship with Alice didn't influence me in a positive way that has helped my current relationship. I can read it in those letters about how far I've really come from being a shitty so (I think). One day, I text my gf about how I found a bunch of stuff like that and that I said it was nice to read. The next day she tried to break up with me because she said she felt incredibly insecure about that and how I might be missing being with Alice. I told her I couldn't accept that as a reason to break up since she said that she still loves me, and tried to reassure her that she is my only plan, which is true.

I really feel love for this girl, and I really believe she loves me. I've never felt a connection with anyone else like I've been feeling with her, and I'm more than excited to see what lies ahead for our future. A lot of what I've written here might seem kind of ugly, but the majority of our day-to-day life and experiences we share are honestly amazing. I'm just worried that this thing with Alice might break us apart somehow, and wondering what I should do if I even can do anything beyond trying to reassure her of my faith in us. A part of me wishes that I could just drop Alice from my life entirely and tell her 'I don't think we should talk anymore' to make things easier and idyllic with my gf, but I think I'd be really unhappy with that decision and lose both respect for myself as well as a good friend, which would probably damage our relationship even moreso in the long run.

tl;dr
Girlfriend feels insecure about me having unresolved feelings for my high school girlfriend from 5 years ago because I've been open about maintaining a friendship with her and finding letters from my past while moving out of my parents house. What should I do?"

So a couple of questions:

Can I switch? I know it's a general first year, but I'm technically under the Faculty of Arts right? Can I also request for the Computing Living Learning Community?

Which one would prepare me more for UX design? That's what I'm aiming for, and I'm not sure which one is more beneficial.

I'm not good at math, so how difficult would you say the math courses are? 

I saw somewhere that you code on paper, how does that work? Does this mean that laptops aren't really used in class?

Any companies that hire from Queen's computing? \(for jobs, internships, both?\)

Is the program more project or exam/test based?

Any tips for success? My other option is Waterloo Global Business and Digital Arts, but it's a relatively new program, so I'm not sure what to make of it.  Anyways, thanks so much in advance. "

Last year, I visited Australia with my family from the Netherlands and I have been absolutely blown away by how beautiful it is and the kindness of the Australians. It was an immensely great time, and especially Sydney was amazing. I mentioned to my girlfriend how cool it would be if we were to live there for a while. Well I guess some dreams do come true, as my girlfriend has been invited to do an internship with a research institute over there. 

We will be moving over in July and staying for about four to five months. We are currently dealing with all the visas and our accommodation there, but all of that will eventually be sorted out. The thing that is still left for me is to find a job. I will be on a working holiday visa, so that should cover the legal aspect. I do wonder how to best find a job. Should I just apply for every matching job on the seek.com.au website, hoping it will fit the period I will be there? Or would it be a viable option to work as a freelancer for four months?

https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/74bl86/f4a_asians/

Hey guys and girls! I want to play out a story with you that involves a desperate, slutty Asian college student. Girls, we can either set up an FF or FFM scenario, whichever you enjoy more :) or just chat about dirty ideas!

Note: I might not be able to play consecutively for long amounts of time, if we click I'm happy to go long term!

If you want to play, just message me which kind of scenario you might be interested in and what your favorite race of Asian sluts is your favorite!

***

I was a repressed teen going through a sexual transformation. After my incredibly virginal high school years at a very conservative school, watched closely by my helicopter parents, I was finally at college. Being a cute, slender Asian girl, I naturally got a lot of attention and, with my hormones going wild, I started going through a crazy boy phase.

My standards - what standards? I want dick. I want to fuck. All of my insecurities and resentments and guilt made me turn into a crazy slut overnight. But who are you exactly? How do you find your way to this desperate Asian chick determined to spend every night in someone else's bed?

I loooove raceplay. Please include it with our roleplay! Are you a white guy ready to pump some yellow pussy full of your cum? Are you a black dude ready to pound some Asian ass? Are you an Asian dude sick of seeing this cute Asian girl grinding on white dudes, who angrily gets a hold of me and fucks my brains out in a frat bro's room?

Kinks: Raceplay, cuckolding, degradation, rough sex, dirty talk, humiliation, spanking, oral, cumplay, dressup/outfits.

Just ideas: 

- the Professor: I come to your office hours, dressed somewhat provocatively. You're married with kids, but you flirt with me and, loving the attention, I reciprocate the interest. Bonus to old, geeky, dirty men.

- the Grad Student Instructor: Similar to the above, but with a younger grad student. Love even including predatory/grooming aspects lol.

- Frat Party Hoe: Either a frat bro or a friend of one? Grind me hard and humiliate me in front of everyone. Do I suck your dick in public at a party? Are you clearly feeling me up during beer pong? Or do you fuck me right in front of my guy friends on a bed?

- [Cuckold](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/67tpmf/f4a_asians/): Are you my best friend, my brother, my cousin, etc? Or a friend crushing on me who's only seen my good girl side? Maybe we go out to a frat or house party and you find my inner hoe when I start sucking the first white or black guy I see there.

- [Asian Gals](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ao86a/f4a_asian_girl/): Dirty as fuck :P so I'm going to start writing some scenario ideas for girls! Haven't gotten any yet so I hope to attract some of y'all 

- [Non-Asian Gals]:

I have so many ideas and I love brainstorming with y'all!

**Asian Women in Business Association:** AWBA is a strong club on campus for Asian girls who want to be strong business leaders. We have lots of outreach events, we get our members excellent internships and jobs, and have huge donations from industry. That's because of the great climate of supporting women and minorities, right?

Wrong. AWBA has a secret approach - targeting the yellow fever of successful white men. Sophia Chen's internship at that big bank? She was the CEO's mistress. Amy Liu? She's the ""diversity chair"", making $500,000 a year introducing the executives and top investors to ""Asian issues"". All of these members give back and all Asian-crazed white executives know about us and donate for our attention.

There are a bunch of ways we can go with this: "
8mfhnp,7,2018-05-27,Stuck in a weird situation. Need some advice.,EchoesUndead,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8mfhnp/stuck_in_a_weird_situation_need_some_advice/,"So me (22M) and my partner (23F) are in a weird spot. We’ve been together for almost two years. I recently got an internship out of state and we’ve had many problems in our past. This prompted her to “focus on herself” over the summer and for us to think about if we are going to be good for each other in the future.

We recently had a talk where she said she wanted to take a break, after having thought, and I asked if that meant break up or break just cause she wasn’t clear about it. She then tells me she needs more time to think about it to see if she even wants a break because her biggest fear is losing me as a friend. I’ve told her I’d still be friends with her but we would never be the same kind of friends we currently are.

I stopped texting her so she could have her space and I’ve done some thinking too. The feelings I’m experiencing are similar to other break ups I’ve had in my life. I keep seeing her posts on social media about how happy she is and everything cause she’s with her friends this weekend and so I unfollowed her so I wouldn’t have to see that stuff to make it a little easier and this caused her to get all weird with me and text me asking about it and asking if “this is how things are going to be.”

Through my own thinking I feel like I don’t necessarily want to be in this with her anymore. I don’t know what I should do if I should ask her if she still wants a break or come out and say I want one as well. Furthermore I don’t know how I can be friends with someone I loved to death for over two years. We are locked into a lease until December and I don’t know if i can live with her either and all of these things are things she doesn’t want to happen. She wants me to live there and still act like I’m best friends with her even if we break up and I don’t know if I can emotionally do that. I don’t want to ignore her either but I’d need a little time to be alone and cleanse my feelings. Anyone else ever been in a similar place?

TLDR: How do you be friends after a serious relationship?"
8mfk42,4,2018-05-27,Totally disillusioned,jinglebells89,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/8mfk42/totally_disillusioned/,"Some background on myself: 28 years old about to turn 29 in July. I was a really shy kid growing up. Never had a girlfriend in school, high school or even college. Always had a great group of guy friends and still do. I grew up in Indiana. Around my freshman year of college I started trying to change myself. I started lifted weights, eating healthy and focusing hard on my grades. 

After school I got an internship in Washington, D.C. This led to a full time job and eventually a job in New York City. It was a sales job but it was with a fast growing startup. For the first time in my life I really felt good about myself. I had become more social and was still lifting weights. I even finally got a girlfriend. We dated for a year and a half. I got promoted at work and was actually managing a team of 15 people. My shyness was something no one I worked with knew about. I had worked hard to overcome it and everyone thought I was a naturally extroverted guy. 

The girlfriend, now ex, came from a dysfunctional family. There were a few red flags there that I ignored. But for a while we really got along great. She really did seem to care about me. Her Mom and her Dad hated each other and this really affected her views on relationships. Long story short she broke my heart. I went off the deep end and got fired from work and kept trying to reach out to her to get her to change her mind. After a year and a half she went from this girl who seemed to be obsessed with me and care about me so deeply to a girl that was now calling the police on me because in her words ""I wouldn't leave her alone"".

Got arrested. She hit me with a restraining order. I started drinking heavily. It's like my insecurities from childhood all came back in full force. I got another job in NYC and only lasted 6 months before I got fired for not hitting my numbers. My previous job I was at for 2 years and I thought I had a few close friends there but when I was fired everyone dropped me. I was all alone in that city after 2 and a half years of building up a life for myself. In a matter of a month or two it was all burned to the ground. 

On the other side of the coin, the professional/coporate world, I can't believe how quickly people can turn on you. I can't people how so many companies and businesses don't care about anything other than profits. I'm also amazed at how many unempathetic and unenlightened people there are in upper management. It's almost like they are robots. People in general for the most part seem to exist in their own little bubbles and don't seem to care much for anything or anyone else but themselves. 

I've got a good friend I grew up with in Indiana who now lives in LA. Last year I moved to LA too and now live right next door to him. We're trying to start a video production company out here. He's got a wife who's a strong minded feminist type. Her friends are the same way. They all drink a\-lot and the single women in her circle of friends seem to sleep around a\-lot and have intimacy issues. They are also all very immature. Their responses to things are bizarre. No communication skills whatsoever. It's like dealing with little kids. I find a\-lot of women my age to be like this. 

The point I'm trying to make is that I feel very disillusioned with people and life in general. While I'm not shy anymore, I feel like I've been to the top of the mountain and discovered nothing was there. I am finding it hard to motivate myself to keep trying and not just move back to Indiana and spend time with my parents. I'd like to meet a woman out here I can date but they all seem so shallow and immature. Again, a\-lot of them sleep around and don't seem to be able to communicate maturely. They are basically just out sewing their oats. I mean I can understand that, too but I don't see how they don't want something deeper or longer lasting. Even when I was in New York after my breakup I slept with a few different women who immediately ghosted me after words. It's like why have sex with me and not try to continue the relationship? One of these women, during sex, shouted out ""You can fuck!"". I know I'm good in bed but it doesn't seem to matter to women. 

Same thing at work. I'm disillusioned by how many insecure shallow people there are. I feel alone and empty and like there is no hope \- \- but I'm not sad. Can anyone related to this feeling? It's like an empitness that is numb. Don't know how else to describe it. If anyone can relate, how do you get past this?

Thanks, 

Lonely in Los Angeles. "

I went to a bridge and sat on the edge of it for a few minutes thinking of taking the plunge. The same thing is happening this summer but this time almost everyone I know is out on internships or enjoying their lives, but I'm still stuck here with no job, and money is running out. The few people I know here are mostly doing their own thing, so I feel extra alone. My depression is starting to hit me pretty hard again and I've been thinking (for the past couple months) that I won't make it to the end of this year. My social anxiety is killing me and keeping me from doing anything. I can barely even talk to the cashier at a fast food place. Im not doing well in school and thinking about the future and how hard it's going to be to find a job is killing me. Ive stopped enjoying the things I used to love doing. Idk I was trying not to vent out about all my problems which I doubt are unique but I can't handle my life any longer. I want to change but there's so much I've fucked up because of my depression. I don't know what I need to fix this. "
8mgr2p,338,2018-05-27,Attack speed displayed in the HUD today is totally messed up &amp; incorrect for any hero with BAT that is not 1.7,icefr4ud,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/8mgr2p/attack_speed_displayed_in_the_hud_today_is/,"So, according to [wiki] (https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Attack_speed#Attack_speed_representation), what is displayed in the HUD is *supposed* to be:

(100 + IAS) * 1.7 / BAT

Here, IAS = increased attack speed = agility + attack speed gained through items + buffs, and BAT = base attack time, which is 1.7 for most heroes.

What this means that what's displayed here **should be** attack speed \*normalised* to the 1.7 BAT space (so that you can compare these numbers between heroes easily ingame, without worrying about different BATs).

However, this is absolutely not the case in practice. It's very easy to verify, open up a demo lobby with Alchemist, level to 25, and check HUD. It'll show you have 45 agility, so net AS should be:

(100 + 45) * 1.7 / 1.7 = 145

This is indeed the case, makes sense. However, pop your ulti, and now your BAT goes to 1. What should be displayed:

(100 + 45) * 1.7 / 1 = 246.5

What's actually displayed: 215. WTF??

On first glance, this looks like something very fishy is going on. In reality what seems to have happened is that the IAS term has gone from inside the parentheses to outside, so the calculation it's doing is:

(100) * 1.7 / 1 + 45 = 170 + 45 = 215  -- the 45 IAS never gets amplified by 1.7.

It's a simple parenthesis error that's totally fucking up the AS displayed for any hero with BAT != 1.7.

In all this though, it also does show the time-between-attacks next to the AS, and that number is always accurate.

(Credits to BSJ's stream, was watching the VODs of ESL Birmingham, came across him digging into this. This same bug is causing the weirdness that makes you think Attack Speed slows are more effective vs high BAT heroes than low BAT heroes @BSJ, it's just a visual bug, they're actually not in practice.)

**TL;DR** intern fucked up parentheses, causing displayed AS to be lower than it should for any hero with BAT != 1.7.

As a side note valve, if this ""displaying AS in the 1.7-BAT space"" is so confusing for the devs in the first place, I'm sure you can imagine just how confusing it is for most players. Just don't do it, display the AS as it is, no modifications. We have enough heroes that have BAT higher or lower than 1.7 now that it no longer feels useful to normalize to that number."

Da ich jedoch ziemlich paranoid unterwegs bin würde ich gerne auf Hersteller-unabhängige Systeme setzten. IoT-Geräte die einfach angestöpselt werden und die Firewall per UPNP aufbohren sind mir ein Graus.

Software-mäßig gibt es genug OSS Angebote, die auf die persönliche Vorlieben angepasst werden können und nicht nach Hause telefonieren. Allerdings habe ich mit der Hardware so meine Probleme, da ich in dem Bereich bisher null Erfahrung habe.

Kennt sich jemand aus und kann Tipps oder Empfehlungen geben? Meine Vorstellung ist eine webcam die per USB an einen Raspi angeschlossen werden kann, ggf. mit Bewegungs-Sensor.

8mh8pn,5,2018-05-27,How would you rank the seasons and why?,mercy_death,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/8mh8pn/how_would_you_rank_the_seasons_and_why/,"Rewatched Greys leading up to the new season and my opinion has changed on some of the seasons.

14. Season 13 - Messy plots, poor pacing, character assasination, bad continuity, too many cast absences, unlikable recurring characters

13. Season 4 - Failed stories such as George and Izzie, Meredith was awful, Hahn sucks

12. Season 9 - Interns were great but the hospital takeover story went on for-ev-er and Callie was intolerable for most of the season

11. Season 8 - Apart from the plane crash and the drunk soft ball I don't even remember this season. 

10. Season 5 - Ghost sex, lack of George, too much Izzie. Wins points for bad-ass Owen, loses them for anything to do with Sadie. The soapiest season at this point.

9. Season 14 - Innofensive season but also unmemorable. Too many exits and rushed plots. Lack of legitimate drama and resolution to long running stories. Gets points for returns and throwbacks and not being entirely miserable.

8.  Season 7 - Cristinas PTSD was interesting, Jackson and April refreshed things, some interesting stand alone episodes. Weakest points was far too much focus on Callie this season.

7. Season 11 - Great great start. Maggies intro was great and she was (for this one season) instantly likeable, Amelia too. The April and Jackson story was brilliantly done and everyone got their share of screentime. Loses points for not knowing what to do with Steph and Jo after losing half of their class (and therefore chosing to give Jo a personality transplant).

Wins points for finally breaking up Calzona after two seasons of terrible behaviour to each other. It's clear that they changed their plans half way through as the back end of the season (except for the finale) was messy.

6. Season 6 - Much needed new life in the show, Izzie finally left and the shooting episode will always be the best episode of the entire run of Grey's. 

5. Season 2 - The show had found its feet and so many major moments of the series happened in this season. It's probably got some of the most memorable patients from the shows run too. 

4. Season 12 - Proving the show could survive/thrive without Derek. April 2.0 (who sadly only existed in this one season before reverting back to being meak in season 13), DeLuca, Steph &amp; Amelia, Bailey as chief, Herman. It was a really strong season for me and felt re-energised. Weaknesses were the back end of the season. The steph arc was a weak copy of Teddy and Izzies stories, the marriage was ridiculous and the custody battle was so out of character for both.

3. Season 3 - The full-time additions of Callie and Mark really rounded out the show as we had a good mix of interns, residents and attendings. There was a large enough cast with enough on-screen history to create really interesting dynamics. 

2. Season 1 - This is so high simply because it's where it all began. Very few shows find their feet so quickly but Greys really did. THe pilot - infact the first five episodes are all incredibly strong.

1. Season 10 - Perhaps a constroversial one but I am a bigger fan of the middle years / later years of Grey's due to my dislike of Izzie, Burke and Hahn. Season 10 was just very well balanced for me. They gave all of this group of residents personalities and found ways to integrate them into the main group like they did with the original interns. It also showed them fighting to get surgeries and actually learning. The season 14 interns are comic relief extras that serve no real depth.

As far as the older cast whilst I felt the Meredith/Cristina fight went on too long, everyone got a chance to shine and it was a brilliant send off for Cristina. The only pitfalls of the season was the pacing of some stories - Richards recovery lasted too long and Baileys recovery didn't even last past an episode. As a whole though - this is the only season that truely gave a full story arc to everyone of it's regular characters in the later years.

**56,305** Heisters *robbing banks* for **6 Years** (And they never got featured? WOW!)

In the year 2013, a daring crew of reckless criminals unleashed a torrent of chaos upon Washington D.C. The world was full of crime. Armed robbery, car theft, looting, bank robbery! Backed by the reclusive genius mastermind, Bain, these clown-masked culprits stop at absolutely nothing to drain the city's vaults and fill their own greedy pockets, causing chaos and destruction wherever they go. Fact of the matter is, there's crime amok, and no one is doing a thing about it: except you, and your team of experts. Together, you and your three friends will continue this crime spree, stealing from those who deserve it, and keeping it all for yourselves. [These are the adventures of: The Payday Crew.](https://youtu.be/sJr6K9NVuQw)

/r/PaydayTheHeist is the subreddit dedicated to chronicling your adventures and heists as a member of this elusive crew. As well, as providing you with information on the two games in the series: Payday: The Heist and Payday 2 [^(every single day of the weeeeeeeeeeek.)](https://youtu.be/Jq4_LTTCO7s?t=3m1s) Littered across the subreddit, you'll see [game updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/8lt17e/new_fbi_files_memo/), [discussion threads about a trilogy that's never gonna happen ~~thanks, Valve~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/8lod6h/what_would_you_like_to_see_in_payday_3/) and sometimes [even fan-art](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/838quo/new_comic/), depicting the heisters that you control in all their glory. 

You may even get the chance to interact with the cogs that keep the sub whole, the moderators, like I did. Either that, or /u/Overkill_Almir may sneak in from time to time and give [cryptic messages ^^not ^^really ^^tho](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/838quo/new_comic/dvh29ff/?context=3) about the status of the game and where it's going. And, trust me, you'll want to say hello to Almir [and his beard](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AC0Y1nDLbbI/maxresdefault.jpg). (It's even a mask in the game, [no joke](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/payday/images/6/6e/Almir%27s_Beard_Fullcolor.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141204233752).) Thankfully, I managed to get a hold of the mods, and get their opinions and some answers about the future.

&gt;# What lead to the creation of the sub?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** That's a question for /u/kingspycrab, I've only been a moderator for a little less than 2 years.

&gt;&gt; **/u/KingSpyCrab**  I had gotten into PAYDAY: The Heist back in 2012, and also became more comfortable with the SPUF (Steampowered User Forums, RIP) and all the members on it. At the same time, I had also made a reddit account and familiarized myself with the website. I was told by many that there was a subreddit for everything, so I stumbled upon /r/paydaytheheist. It was very dead, had about 3-4 posts about certain updates. I put in a request to own the subreddit, and the rest was history. Initially, there were 140 subscribers to the subreddit, but I was young and determined to make the sub grow. PAYDAY 2 was released and there was an astronomical increase in subscribers. The rest is history, and I have the dedicated mod team, Discord team, and all the subscribers to thank for it.

&gt;&gt; **/u/CaptainCupcakez** While I wasn't around when it was created, the subreddit was made just 3 days after the release of the first Payday game. The Payday series has always had passionate fans, and right from the start the subreddit has been a huge part of the community for the games.

&gt;# Favorite Heister?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** Dallas.    
&gt;&gt; **/u/CaptainCupcakez** Clover! Honorable mention goes to Hoxton for being my favourite PD;TH heister.    
&gt;&gt;**/u/KingSpyCrab** Hoxton, Dallas is a close second (OG squad)    
&gt;&gt;**/u/Szkieletor** Clover. Shotouts to ~~Simpleflips~~ Sydney for a very visually interesting first-person viewmodel, shame you can't see it in VR. Chains was my PDTH choice, and my PD2 OG.

Fucking Dallas and Hoxton mains... I swear. (I too am a filthy Hoxton main, ass breath, dick head, twat, Houston or whatever you call him just wasn't a suitable substitute. Needed more Pete Gold.)

&gt;# What's going on with the story?

&gt;&gt; **/u/KingSpyCrab** Dude, I have no idea.

&gt;# Why can't we see Bain's face?

&gt;&gt; **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** He's shy.
&gt;&gt; **/u/CaptainCupcakez** The world isn't ready for that...    
&gt;&gt; **/u/KingSpyCrab** Because he's ugly.
&gt;&gt; **/u/Szkieletor**  Still building hype for the face reveal. Imagine the revenue when that drops.

&gt;# Where do you expect the story to go from here? Where's the endgame?

&gt;&gt; **/u/KingSpyCrab** I like where the story is going, mystery and teasing is OVERKILL's strong suit, and I'm expecting the elusive ""secret"" to make itself known in the coming months.

&gt;&gt; **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** Hopefully another secret vault hidden in a current heist similar to Overvault, with the resolution of Baldwin and Cagliostro's feud. I'm hoping Giancarlo Esposito comes back and voices some final lines for the story resolution.

&gt;&gt; **/u/Szkieletor** Conclusion to The Secret. I also wouldn't be opposed to the gang falling apart and then slowly coming back together for PD3.

&gt;# The Thermal Drill, [did you go get it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsW2sYiChCo)

&gt;&gt; **/u/CaptainCupcakez** There are drills in this game? No wonder it's taking me so long to complete heists...    
&gt;&gt; **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** Far too many times.    
&gt;&gt; **/u/KingSpyCrab** u cant do thermal drol in shadoh reid

&gt;&gt; **/u/Szkieletor** Here's the deal with the drill: the first 500 times Bain reminds you, it's annoying. Later, you don't even hear it. You filter it out. Then you realize it's been 30 minutes into Bank Heist and the drill's still on the truck.

&gt;# [What cocksuckin' mutha'fooker measured the C4?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G78CMTqZhB8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m43s)

&gt;&gt; **/u/Heroic_Sheperd** Wolf is the technician, blame him.    
&gt;&gt;**/u/Szkieletor** Houston's reaction is pretty telling. Wolf's fault for giving the C4 to the intern.

8mhqhm,1,2018-05-27,"Baker Tilly vs. PwC (Northern, VA office)",jacobrk03,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8mhqhm/baker_tilly_vs_pwc_northern_va_office/,"Hi Guys!  I am a rising junior at the University of Richmond, pursuing a major in accounting with a concentration in finance.  I will have my 150 credits by summer 2020.  This is my first post in this group, but I’ve been trying to read through this subreddit as much as possible to get some information about the public accounting industry.  I would greatly appreciate any advice concerning my situation.  I don’t want to sound like a snob; I am very grateful and fortunate to have this decision between two top firms.

I recently finished up an externship with Baker Tilly and really enjoyed the whole experience.  Obviously, they were trying to make themselves sound more enticing than the Big 4 (more family like culture, better work/life balance, more flexibility and diversity with what you are working on). Also, I have no idea if I want to go with Audit or Tax, which Baker Tilly doesn’t make you decide until after the internship.  I received a call from the partner the day after I interviewed who extended an offer for an internship for next summer.

In two weeks, I will attending PwC’s Externship program and had to choose Audit already.  Going into Baker Tilly, I knew in the back of my mind that I wanted PwC, but Baker Tilly did a good job of proving otherwise; I know my opinion will probably flip after PwC’s Externship.

From what I’ve gathered there are pros and cons to each side:

Baker Tilly: Better culture (more family like feel), slightly better work/life balance, more flexibility and diversity

PwC: Prestige, name brand recognition, Fortune 500 clients, better opportunities, more technological advancement, international presence

The way I see it, if I want to stay in public accounting, go with Baker Tilly (life will be better next 10 years, end up making less money?), if I want to leave and go to corporate/private, choose PwC (rough next 3,4,5 years, end up making more money?)

I don’t know how big the differences in money between the two outcomes would be (partner at Baker Tilly, or going corporate after PwC).  I want to make a comfortable living, but don’t know if I want to sell my soul doing so. 

For anyone who is still reading, thank you for your time.  I really appreciate your advice and would love to hear your experiences.  Also, if there is a post that details a similar situation, please post it below.

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

AWBA. A popular but exclusive club for Asian girls at this college who want to make a big impact on the business world. We're out there doing activism, hosting major outreach events, and recruiting the most talented East Asian women to our organization. We're extremely well-funded, but no one suspects how much money we really have. Industry just likes supporting women and minorities, right? But we have a dirty secret, a secret purpose:

- targeting the yellow fever of successful white men to put Asian women on top

Top white leaders and execs with yellow fever give big donations to be on the top of our radar. Our members get great internship and job offers for inflated salaries while basically doing no work. Just have to keep the bosses happy with some blowjobs and sex! Our best donors often get married or mistresses from our ranks.

Sophia Chen's internship at that big bank? She was the CEO's mistress. Amy Liu? She's the ""diversity chair"", making $500,000 a year introducing the executives and top investors to ""Asian issues"". All of these members give back and all Asian-crazed white executives know about us and donate for our attention.

If you're interested, please check out some scenario ideas! Feel free to mix, match, and suggest your own!

***

**Asian girls:**

- New pledge: Go through the recruitment, where we evaluate your attractiveness, your potential interest in our cause, and start training you. I'm one of the pledgemasters so I'll be working a lot with you :)

- Pledgemaster: You do the recruiting! I'm a new pledge so you get to vet me and introduce me to this world. Maybe you even end up being my big?

- Public relations: The CEO of a huge multinational corporation has expressed interest on the behalf of a group of top executives and some of the top shareholders. He's coming to visit the club house for a meeting and already sent us a huge donation for a private meeting with two lead members. We were the obvious choices to receive him.

- White boy grooming: We're on the Acquisition board, scoping out the nerdy white guys who are graduating and going to top positions with fantastic salaries. Making the proper introductions to start a new couple with another graduating member? Or introducing top talent to work with us and make new connections?

***

**White guys:**

- Opening connections: You're a top exec. What company? How high? You've heard about us from a friend at another firm and with your Asian fetish, you don't hesitate to contact us. For a donation, we offer an interview to open a connection. Are you visiting the house or is a representative going to meet you at a hotel room? We can even send two if the venture seems profitable enough.

- Offering the internship: You're a top exec at a company with healthy ties to our organization. You submit a request for a new intern to shadow you in Business Administration. I'll be your intern, a smart student to the outside world who does smaller projects and shadows you. But behind closed doors, I'm your college-aged Asian mistress.

- Asian step-son: You have an Asian step-son with your Asian wife. She's often away so you have your sexy interns over, flaunting the cute Asian girls in front of your step-son. He's tormented by it, but you've blackmailed him into secrecy. Today you come home with me, your intern this summer. Except I was from his high school and he had a major crush on me. Time to watch his dad fuck the brains out of his high school crush?

***

**Asian cucks:**

- Meeting the new intern: You're aware of the secret purpose of our organization, as your boss hires our girls as interns. I'm the new one this year, and you get conflicting feelings of attraction and resentment. Does my boss let you watch us fuck? Or do you spy on us?

- Asian step-son: This but from the Asian guy POV! You have an Asian step-son with your Asian wife. She's often away so you have your sexy interns over, flaunting the cute Asian girls in front of your step-son. He's tormented by it, but you've blackmailed him into secrecy. Today you come home with me, your intern this summer. Except I was from his high school and he had a major crush on me. Time to watch his dad fuck the brains out of his high school crush?"

Objectively my life is in a good place - I have a supportive family, I got into my postgraduate program immediately after finishing my internship and clearing the national level entrance test for it and in fact I'm the youngest person in my program.

But everyday interactions feel like a struggle because of my anxiety. Small things - like patients asking for advice or looking for reassurance, talking to patients when they are frustrated, getting to know my own batchmates in the other specialities (in radiology I'm supposed to have a lot of interaction with pretty much every speciality since residents come to the radio guy on call to get investigations done) or handling quips from my seniors and faculty even when I know they are just being friendly - make me feel very uncomfortable and defensive. You know like the feeling as a kid of being caught with your hand in the cookie jar and being questioned about it. Retrospectively I know I have a lot of power in those interactions but at the time each conversation feels like an interrogation, like a minefield I have to navigate. I feel put on the spot and a lot of times feel at a loss at how to respond.

Like the other day at lunch I sat with a couple of residents who I met for the first time and they started talking about how they went clubbing and it was wild etc and asked me to go with them the next time. I just felt very uncomfortable and out of place. I never go partying. It's not that I'm introverted but even when I'm with friends I prefer being with one roommate two people and feel uncomfortable in big crowds. I'd rather sit alone at lunch than join a table with five people already sitting there. Even though I know they will be friendly and welcoming, I just can't make myself do it. 

I used to think as I became more successful in life I'd get over my anxiety somewhat just by virtue of gaining more experience and confidence but this anxiety is like a hydra. You cut of one head and two more spawn to take its place...."

My mom who was sad and very lonely seems much happier. My brother got the career he wants and has a happy life in the wonderland that is Canada.

I got real life friends, online bros to play games with, everything is great. Everything...is great. Best times of my life. But my soul's hungry for, well, something. 

What I don't have much success of is girls. I've had experiences, sure, my longest relationship was 3 months with some girl that made me a little more jaded about love (nothing dramatic, she just up and left back to another country. Well, despite what she wants Catalonia ain't a country IN YO FACE MIRIAM). 

I still think I'll meet the one girl one day, sure. But.....will that be enough? And if I write that novel that keeps dancing in my head, pounding on the walls, will that also fulfill me? 

I was once told by a depressive person that some of us aren't wired to be happy and that even the perfect life might not bring this inner completion we all want (I'm paraphrasing the drunk parts). Or maybe I'm a huge asshole that has never known cancer, or being too poor to afford a meal, to actually savor happiness.

If the girl, if the writing, if all that isn't enough...

I've also been big into modding in the past, so I'd be open to helping with missions or any sort of scripting.

- Around my age/slightly older demographic.

- I'd like to find a group that does PMC style missions, but I'd be open to US Military style too.

- Relaxed environment, no heavy milsim. I can stand organized structure but I'm not calling anyone sir.

You can get information from people manning the booths. Meeting people happens when you just strike up a conversation. Clubs are a great place, so are your classes. In the first few weeks everyone will be wanting to make friends, talk to people early on (ask what their major is, where they are from, ect.

I basically have no work experience. I tried getting an apprenticeship/work in IT/software development but to no avail.

I want to put myself in a position where I will never have to be stuck in this limbo ever again because quite frankly its horrible and depressing. So I'm looking at going to Uni to study computer Science/software development and hopefully increase my chances at getting a job and I plan on trying to get internships over each summer until I graduate with the goal of moving country. 

But is there anything else I can honestly do to give myself the best chance possible?

I have a few worries, the main one being that i wont be able to get an internship without much  work experience prior, can someone weigh in on this? But also coming out of my degree and being stuck in the same position im in now like some of my friends are currently."
8mm1xc,3,2018-05-27,New duty involving logistics but no experience,balloonninjas,EmergencyManagement,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmergencyManagement/comments/8mm1xc/new_duty_involving_logistics_but_no_experience/,"Hey everyone, I apologize for the long post:

I was recently assigned a new duty at my current place of work involving the management of our new logistics warehouse. After Hurricane Irma last year, my county identified the need for a central warehouse to store things like cots and other supplies for use during activation. We now have the space and deliveries are coming in daily, amounting to a few Million dollars worth of equipment, supplies, rations, etc.

I've been placed in charge of being at the warehouse to receive deliveries, make sure they are what we ordered, design some sort of system to track it all and make sure we got everything we ordered \(there is a system on the way but it hasn't completed the procurement process yet... so for now its all me\), organizing everything and placing it in the warehouse in an efficient way, and mobilization/demobilization planning.

I have no experience in any of this.. The most related thing I've done is coming home to a UPS package on my doorstep every once in a while, or organizing the tiny storage room in our office. Additionally, I keep thinking about more and more things that are needed to do this job, such as OSHA knowledge, adequate training \(I should be certified to use the forklift if I'm running the place, right?\), and having my own vehicle since the warehouse is miles from the main EM office.

At the moment, the warehouse is just a large mostly\-empty building. It used to be a museum, so the museum folks still have a bunch of stuff laying around that they're working on getting rid of that is taking up our space. We have random things like cots and diapers and toilets and small generators piled up taking up most of the space but it's not organized any more than ""this came from this shelter and this came from this delivery."" No shelving, not even an office for me. I've been using one of our EOC laptops \(no WiFi either, luckily another county employee was there helping move stuff around and let me use his hotspot\) and sitting at one of the museum's leftover tables but all of the museum stuff is supposed to be gone in the next couple of weeks.

I'm going to submit a list to my supervisor for everything I need, but knowing the county it'll take weeks for anything to actually get done and I'll get plenty of pushback since they don't like to spend money on anything. Even my current position being funded is a blessing and it only here because of the nightmare that Irma was. I'm actually on an entry\-level temporary contract with a maximum amount of hours per week, so I don't get much.. not even allowed to drive a county vehicle or be issued uniforms. The only reason I haven't moved to another agency yet is the job market is a nightmare and I haven't heard back from any applications yet. 

One pro from this is that I know there are full\-time positions on the way but they have to make it through the entire county process before they will be available. I've been told that it should be around November and I'll transfer into one of those \(that's their plan, anyway. I know the county better than to depend on it and I'm still applying elsewhere because having an actual position anywhere is better than this part\-time position without benefits. If anybody is hiring, I'll gladly send you my resume!\)

I'm a planner in blue skies and an ops guy in grey skies and I genuinely enjoy the programs that I work on. This warehouse is certainly a drastic change of pace for me, since my current duties are planning for a couple other programs and mentoring interns. Now, it's pretty much ""we'll find somebody else to do that stuff, here you go do this since nobody else knows how."" We're entering hurricane season now, too, so I am definitely on edge because I don't want to be activated and mess things up because I don't know what I'm doing.

I'm thinking about reaching out to one of the logistics guys from a disaster response NGO that is based in the area for tips. I'm confident in my learning abilities that I can figure all of this out eventually, but my concern is that at the moment it is not a usable resource and I'm responsible. Anyway, I'm not sure if this post is asking for help or just venting. Either way, if anyone has any input, it's much appreciated.

TL;DR got stuck on a program that is brand new to me and my agency and I have no idea what I'm doing. Help."

I'm a smallish girl in my 20's currently studying in a master's program in the US (subject matter not important, but it consumes basically all my time) and I have a new problem. Maybe some can relate or suggest a course of action...

I am living away from home and, to support myself, I took out a federal loan and have been living in an airbnb because it is affordable. My university program is moving the entire department 30~45 minutes away because of some internal issue, and it will be out of my reach because I only have a bike and, being a smallish girl that cannot bike such distances, I'm sort of left in the dust. Furthermore, the only way to get to class is a bike ride to a train station, then a 45 minute train, and then another bike ride or uber ride. Also the city they are moving to is very dangerous crime-wise in the area between the train station and the university, so I don't feel safe biking and would probably need to uber to class 3 days a week. Finally, my classes are from 6:30-9pm so it's a fairly dangerous time for me to be out. 

I have been looking for apartments nearby for weeks and have been completely let down by realtors and friends alike, watching my options vanish between my fingers. My only remaining options are in areas of fairly high crime and poverty in which I genuinely fear for my living conditions. I don't have any useful friends remaining, my parents can't help me out more financially, I don't think I can take out another loan, and I don't have time to work because of the multiple projects I have to complete during the summer for my degree. Also the prospect of roommates terrifies me due to previous negative experiences.


As far as the facts go I was in a hurry to rent an apartment and told my current airbnb host that I would be out by June 3, since, otherwise, I would owe her the entire month. To seal the deal, I had an ""ok"" place lined up and it was given away because the owner forgot she wanted to let me rent it out. I am now facing being possibly homeless while still trying to go to school, complete projects, and line up a new apartment where I can feel safe, while also juggling an internship I will be starting soon (in order to complete another department related requirement). 

Also the federal loan I got last year is running out so if I don't get a place quick and stay here 1 more month I will not have enough money for the deposit on a new place and I will be technically ""stuck"" in an unmovable position.

Is there anything that I am missing? I feel as though the school is treating me unfairly since I planned out my life in this area and now am in a very difficult situation due to them moving to such a difficult area. Lastly, I wanted to point out I have been searching for apartments since 3 weeks ago when the university move was made final and was announced to me formally.

Is there anything I can do that I am not aware of and will not put me in an overly uncomfortable situation? Is there any advice someone here can offer me?  I already barely eat food and I walk to class. I have thought about donating blood or selling my belongings, but even that won't get me a home. Anyway, sorry for the rambling, but I have few places left to turn to...

8mma2z,5,2018-05-27,First bike! So excited,jerrdann,cycling,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/8mma2z/first_bike_so_excited/,"Hi guys! 

I finally took the plunge and bought my first bike, a Specialized Allez Elite. I wanted to share that excitement, and some of my journey with y'all. 

I recently got an internship in Cupertino and I am very close to work \(\&lt;6 miles\), so I figured what the heck, I'll get a bike and commute to work as long as the weather is amicable. 

I haven't ridden a bike \(really\) since 2015, and I'm pretty out of shape. I'm not overweight, but I have smoked 2 packs a day for 2 years, and my lungs hate me because of it. p.s. I stopped smoking as well, because it's way hard to smoke in Cupertino and Santa Clara and ultimately, I want to be a lot healthier. 

Initially, I wanted to get a Diverge e5, but I really wanted Future Shock, and the base models didn't have it, and unfortunately, my budget was 1500 after tax. 

Either way, I just got home and rode 3 miles on it to get a better feel of the bike and how it rides, since I haven't been on a bike in a long time, and wow! 

1. The bike is so light it's amazing to think that I've ever ridden anything else; I can't believe that they get lighter than that! 
2. The saddle is a bit rough on my ""junk"" and inner thigh. Is there anything. I am pretty thin, but my booty bones seem to be wider than the saddle and it sits right in between them and almost pinches me. 
3. Are there any tips and tricks you would share for a new rider, especially in the urban/commute space? I've read some blogs and other articles here and there, but I would like your perspective as well.

I'm a CS Student studying in the east coast (FL), hoping to become a Paramedic at some point. When I've the free time, I watch a lot of YouTube (engineering, STEM, DIY, and some gaming), play some video games and rest.

My hobbies include DIY/tinkering, working on my server and playing handheld games.

8mnmam,0,2018-05-28,401k Loan for Wedding,RaulSlug,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8mnmam/401k_loan_for_wedding/,"**EDIT: I'll be going with putting money in a separate savings account and doing a direct deposit to that account rather than doing double contributions to my 401k, this is far less convoluted, less risk involved, no cost advantage to worry about, and I will still not see the money either way! Thanks for helping me see where my plan failed! 401k loan = only in EXTREME emergency and when in need of that liquidity**

PLEASE FINISH READING BEFORE POSTING ABOUT HOW BAD A 401k LOAN IS.

So basically I want to have about 10\-15k saved up for a wedding in about a year and a few months. Was thinking about contributing 40&amp;#37; of salary to my ROTH 401k plan and maxing out my contributions for this year \(I was an intern but now hired full\-time thus eligible to make 401k contributions starting next week\). My original plan was to simply put 20&amp;#37; in \(company only matches 3&amp;#37; fml\) and save the other 20&amp;#37; for the wedding but thought ""why not bundle it up and just put 40&amp;#37; in the IRA?"". The nice part being getting some gainz for three quarters of the year and then paying myself back either way. Was living off of $20/hr working part\-time and going to school for last few years, now will have over a 50&amp;#37; increase in pay, so I'm not sure I will miss that 40&amp;#37; coming out of my paycheck especially since I was going to save hard core for the wedding anyways.

Alternative would be putting in the 20&amp;#37; of my paycheck AFTER I get my paycheck in a high\-yielding savings account, but I fear that I might be tempted to save less then the 20&amp;#37; and would rather never get it to begin with...\(set up a *second* direct deposit through work maybe..?\)

Risks:

* Losing my job \(we're bleeding for new hires at work and it's a government contractor position where the average age is about 40... I think I'll be fine. Last person that was fired was over eight years ago for watching some NSFW with gov property\).
* Missing out gains \- it's either slapping this money in the 401k and taking it out as a loan where I repay myself at 3&amp;#37; interest or just accruing the 10k in a high yielding savings account. I like borrowing from the 401k since I would have to replenish that money either way, thus putting in extra contributions.
* Taking out future 401k loans\- probably won't be doing that since this is a one time expense, unless I did the same method to save up for a down payment for a home?
* Lower contributions once I have the loan thus missing out on gains \(I would go from 40&amp;#37; contribution to 20&amp;#37; contribution either way...shit I might realize I don't need the money and just go down to 30&amp;#37;!\)

Am I missing anything? I'm basically double saving upfront so that I don't see that money to begin with, then having to pay it back again. Never heard of people do this.

Other info: about 13k in student loans \(4&amp;#37;, begin repayment January of next year, was about 18k, paid down 5k while in school, making 200 payment bi\-weekly currently\), my wife and I will most likely move into her parents home while I receive a townhome rental property \(we may continue to live at her parent's home and pocket the rental property cash\), have an emergency fund of 10k to handle bare minimum living expenses for 3\-6 months, own all our vehicles and pay about 180 for insurance a month, live in California.

**tl;dr** Contribute 40&amp;#37; of paycheck to 401k, then take out loan for half of it, continue to contribute 20&amp;#37; as I repay loan. **But have decided to simply put 20\% into a separate savings account, the tax advantage isn't there and doesn't make sense to have the burden down the road!**"

because i always wonder how they keep their dishes hot or cold for dishes that have ice cream or other time sensitive dishes.  

i also wonder whether the judges taste the meals in menu order and edited ""out of order"" for broadcast drama - it would suck if your savoury dish was tasted after a sweet dish because the judges palate would be out of whack.

8movsa,1,2018-05-28,Advice needed,mopeybunny,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8movsa/advice_needed/,"My nickname is Juno, so you guys can call me that. I came across this forum because I was browsing how deal living with my emotionally abusive, opioid-addicted, schizophrenic, lazy mother. 

Throughout my life she has always made me feel like I’m worthless. I fold a piece of paper next to her, and she goes ballistic. She has alienated me from the entire family as a child because she’s always claiming people are out to ruin her happiness.

She claims she hates my stepfather and wants him to die. She gets angry if I dare to speak to him by myself or let him know our whereabouts. But, then the next day she causally asks him to buy her a ton of make up — which I don’t understand because that woman never leaves her room or her bed. 

I’m 24, and I feel like a total loser because I flunked out of my university’s program, and I’m in massive debt. 

I’ve tried to move out several times unsuccessfully — I even stripped at one point to be independent, but was raped by a client. The rape led me into psychiatric hospitals, and rape treatment centers, but she says I was led into a psychiatric hospital because I stole her oxy’s. I have never touched any of her pills in my life. I find oxys thrown around the house. When I tell her that I found them behind a TV — she casually says “I know that they were there. I left them there to see if you would touch it”

The woman blames the rape on me and has never expressed any type of comfort. If I fold a piece of paper next to her she goes ballistic, and on a tangent that everyone is jealous of her. 

I hate to say it but I hate my mother. I wish I didn’t.

I have major social anxiety and depression. All I want in my life is to be able to have a decent career, a healthy marriage, love for myself, and distance myself as much as possible away from her. 

I don’t have any hobbies. I just try to sleep as much as possible, and tune out my reality. 

It just seems like an uphill battle for independence. I start a new job tomorrow that pays fairly well and I’m returning to my university in August. My boyfriend who landed a great internship in Michigan tells me that I should go move in with him, but I feel scared because I haven’t admitted to him that I’m afraid of making new friends, and I’m afraid that he’s going to see me for what I am. A depressed person.

8mp0kp,1,2018-05-28,"Forced Crossdressing, William's Story - by [Jules] with [Forced] [Crossdressing] [Feminization] [Taboo Friendly] [Fantasy]",AutoModerator,LadiesOfKINK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesOfKINK/comments/8mp0kp/forced_crossdressing_williams_story_by_jules_with/,"**A classic case of forced crossdressing.**

To be a cross dresser you would think that one just has to change. It’s not that easy though. Our society has become a lot more accepting, but there is still the stigma that you are gay.  If you choose to wear the opposites sex clothing, you must be homosexual. That is not always the truth. 

Standing in the gymnasium, William knew this was not right. He was sure that this joke couldn’t be serious. Those girls were so mean to him when he lost the bet. Fast forward here.

“William, let’s go talk in private. I have arranged with the Principal for a conference room for us.”

She couldn’t be serious, right? She believed this crap? I am not a cross dresser. I am just the victim of a bad prank. These pantyhose feel so odd. Squishing my manhood. How do women do this?

Once the door closed, she turned with a huge smile. One I thought was fake at first, but learned later was because she needed me here.

“I am so excited to have you on board. You wont be our first Crossdresser.”

WHAT? She thought I was going to stay this way? The more I tried to resist, the more she pushed me to conform. How the heck was I going to do this was all I could think at first. I needed this internship so bad.

**“I miss need to call your Mom and tell her. This number is okay?”**

Before I could say no, she was dialing the house number and had my Mother on the phone. Right then I could of completely died. My Mother would not understand this at all.

“Hi this is Jessica with the internship program at the School. We have William in here and he, well she, has signed on with out company. I want to assure you that we are find with her kind. We have made all needs necessary to adjust the facilities for her.”

**I could hear her quiet for a moment, and her eyes went to my direction, followed by a disapproving glance.  This was forced crossdressing.**

“How about you just meet us at the school and we can discuss this in private. I’m sorry too. I will see you soon.”

She scolded me about this. She told me that I should of told my Mother, but she will help me with the transformation and hold my hand through it all.

**WHAT TRANSFORMATION. IT WAS A DARE!**

Of course I didn’t scream that, but inside of me I did. Inside I wanted to run to the bathroom and cry, but what bathroom. The mens or the womens?

“Welcome, and William is all ready to talk to you. She is sorry she did not tell you, but today, well it’s her day to come out. We will have rules though. If you need some help with shopping for her clothing, we can advance her paycheck.”

My Mother looked like she was slapped. Her eyes widened and she looked as though she was going to cry. I’ve disappointed her, but this woman was relentless with convincing her it was all okay. Once we took the paper and left, the ride home would be awkward.

“You’re gay?”

“You want to be a girl”

“Where did I go wrong with you?”

“Fine, you wanted this. Once we buy all this, after you tell your Dad, were burning everything you own. You want this and now you will have forced crossdressing.”

&amp;nbsp;    
&amp;#40;2018Z07144&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het bericht ‘Miljoenen te besparen op dure medicijnen’? 1&amp;#41; Wat vindt u hiervan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, ik ben bekend met het artikel. En ik ben blij dat er door middel van de introductie van biosimilars tegenwicht wordt geboden aan de soms hoge prijzen voor geneesmiddelen. Zie voorts de antwoorden op de volgende vragen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Herkent u het beeld dat artsen minder vaak goedkopere biosimilars voorschrijven terwijl die even goed zijn?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit de laatste Monitor Dure Geneesmiddelen van de Nederlandse Zorgautoriteit blijkt dat artsen steeds vaker overgaan tot het voorschrijven van zogenaamde biosimilars. Dat zijn geneesmiddelen die gelijkwaardig zijn aan een origineel biologisch geneesmiddel, de zogenaamde originator. Deze goede ontwikkeling zullen wij de komende jaren blijven stimuleren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het voorschrijven van biosimilars is echter geen doel op zich. Het belangrijkste is dat de introductie van biosimilars concurrentie stimuleert, waardoor de prijzen dalen. Dit kan er ook toe leiden dat de originator uiteindelijk het goedkoopste middel is.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De mate waarin biosimilars worden voorgeschreven is daarmee niet de beste graadmeter: belangrijker is dat ziekenhuizen goede inkoopafspraken over biologische geneesmiddelen weten te maken en of ziekenhuizen er bij de keuze voor een biosimilar in slagen middels een goed introductieprogramma en een goede begeleiding van de patiënt de omzetting van originator naar een biosimilar succesvol weten door te voeren. Hiervoor is goede samenwerking tussen ziekenhuisapothekers, verpleegkundigen en medisch specialisten doorslaggevend. De ‘Toolbox biosimilars’, ontwikkeld door de Nederlandse Vereniging voor Ziekenhuisapothekers &amp;#40;NVZA&amp;#41; en de Federatie Medisch Specialisten &amp;#40;FMS&amp;#41;, biedt hier een handreiking voor. Ook is noodzakelijk dat de soms nog aanwezige onduidelijkheden en/of onterechte twijfels over de gelijkwaardigheid van biosimilars worden weggenomen, waarmee de acceptatie van biosimilars wordt vergroot. Vandaar dat het traject Biosimilars Op Maat &amp;#40;BOM&amp;#41;, dat zich hierop richt, vanuit het ministerie van VWS wordt gesubsidieerd &amp;#40;zie ook antwoord op vraag 4&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Herkent u het beeld, dat er een besparing van 350 miljoen per jaar te behalen is, wanneer artsen biosimilars zouden voorschrijven wanneer dat een even goed alternatief is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik herken het beeld dat de inzet van biosimilars kan leiden tot een &amp;#40;forse&amp;#41; besparing op de uitgaven aan geneesmiddelen. Er wordt steeds meer gebruik gemaakt van biosimilars en er komen steeds meer biosimilars op de markt voor biologische geneesmiddelen waar het patent van is verlopen. Mede hierdoor zijn de prijzen van deze geneesmiddelen in beweging en verandert ook het besparingspotentieel continue. Tot welke besparing dit op dit moment kan leiden is mij daarom niet bekend. Vanwege de mogelijke besparingen vind ik het wel van groot belang om het gebruik van biosimilars te ondersteunen, zie ook het antwoord op vraag 4 en 5.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke inspanningen heeft u verricht om artsen hierop te wijzen? Welk effect heeft dit tot nog toe gehad?  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat gaat u doen om de reputatie van biosimilars te verbeteren, zodat wanneer medicijnen precies even goed werken, de goedkopere variant wordt voorgeschreven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4 en 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vooropgesteld wordt het doelmatig inkopen van geneesmiddelen door ziekenhuizen al gestimuleerd, o.a. door de bekostigingssystematiek van de medisch-specialistische zorg in Nederland. Dit geldt ook voor biologische geneesmiddelen.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Voorts, zoals in het artikel ook wordt aangehaald, is onlangs een subsidie verleend aan het Instituut voor Verantwoord Medicijngebruik &amp;#40;IVM&amp;#41; voor de uitvoering van het BOM-traject. Het IVM voert dit project uit samen met de Initiatiefgroep Biosimilars Nederland. In dit traject worden ziekenhuizen op hun verzoek op maat ondersteund bij o.a. het informeren van medisch-specialisten, verpleegkundigen, ziekenhuisapothekers én patiënten over de gelijkwaardigheid van biosimilars. Ook kunnen zij ondersteunen bij het ontwikkelen van intern beleid voor biologische geneesmiddelen. De eerste geluiden vanuit de ziekenhuizen over de start van dit traject zijn positief.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast vindt er regelmatig uitwisseling met een groot aantal veldpartijen op het gebied van biosimilars plaats. Hierin wordt ook gesproken over de wijze waarop partijen het gebruik van de goedkoopste biosimilar of originator verder kunnen stimuleren.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het gebruik van biosimilars wordt steeds gewoner, met name doordat steeds meer medisch specialisten en patiënten ervaring opdoen met deze geneesmiddelen. Als partijen zich blijven inspannen zal met de tijd ook de koudwatervrees afnemen. Door middel van trajecten als het BOM-traject proberen wij dit zo veel mogelijk aan te jagen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het vergroten van de kennis over en de toepassing van biologische geneesmiddelen, en biosimilars in het bijzonder, hebben niet alleen wij, maar alle partijen die direct of indirect betrokken zijn bij het gebruik van deze geneesmiddelen een verantwoordelijkheid. Het is dan ook goed om te zien dat niet alleen wij, maar vooral ook andere partijen in het veld zich inzetten om geneesmiddelen voor iedereen betaalbaar en toegankelijk te houden.

8mq1k0,26,2018-05-28,Managing anxiety starting internship,Vibrantmender20,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/8mq1k0/managing_anxiety_starting_internship/,"Hi all! 

I’m having a bad case of imposter syndrome going into my internship. Up to this point I have had no clinical experiences outside of simulated sessions in my masters program (counseling MS), and am feeling pretty intimidated by my upcoming sessions. 

I do well in all my classes and have a fair amount of course hours under my belt, but can’t seem to shake this feeling that I know next to nothing about being a therapist. It almost feels like there’s a big exam coming up and I haven’t studied at all. 

I don’t expect to be an expert therapist right out of the gate by any means, but what can you all recommend to battle my anxiety and be as helpful to my clients as possible? Also, what “small steps” should I focus on in my early clinical experiences? 

Thanks! "

I'm a mechanical engineer student and in my internship i have to build an electronic circuit. I have done it but i'm not sure if it will work as intended, because I don't have mush experience in electricity. So before buying the part I decided to simulate the circuit. My problem is that my circuit is control by a raspberry pi and I don't find simulation of it online, also there is other part that i don't find online such as a NCP3008. So I wonder how can I do my simulation ? For the pi if it's too complexe to simulate I intended to remplace the gpio pin by some voltage/ampere source, but for the part I don't find online I think i have to learn how to simulate them from the data sheet but I have problem starting it.

So in short:

1) How can i simulate the pi/ remplace it by a simple model

2)What is the methodology to model a part from the data sheet 

Thanks in advance . "

I had an internship I disliked (took a lot of time that I really wanted to be using for other stuff) and had overloaded myself in terms of classes and thus was stressed and had no time to deal with that or go deep into these classes I liked.  Anyway, I spent this time not being deliberate with my life and I slipped into a place where I couldn't really think effectively anymore.  The main idea was that I was trying to figure out how to use internet at home in a healthy way, and had for some of this time been trying to figure out how to use porn in a healthy way.  For many other reasons but also the very important reason that porn use and internet misuse are quite intertwined with me, it's important for me to improve my relationship with the internet.    

Just as figuring out good internet use is a healthy LT (in this case quite necessary) strategy, so I feel ultimately is successfully doing the same with porn.  However, unlike internet, I neither really feel I want any porn in my life nor is it necessary.  I do intuitively feel that a healthier relationship to porn use, maybe and hopefully even achieveable somehow never touching porn again, is very important though so as to prevent catastrophic porn relapses and this kind of shame mentality and corrosive fear surrounding porn that I feel definitely bleeds into a whole range of other aspects in life if not examined and fixed.  Of course, it's a super bad idea to spend all this time trying to tweak something instead of committing to a total cut and run on things that are just so demonstrabely overall terrible.  For example, I haven't touched alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes in 4 years and in no way do I actually regret being basically afraid of drug et al. use and committing to total sobriety for the rest of my life.  Yes it can be uncomfortable at times, and yes, I do feel sad that I feel we live in a kind of emotional Stone Age vis-a-vis issues like this that prevent any true societal growth, but I feel the end result is so clearly worth the time that I get out of it.  

## Current Approach

I'll describe my current approach.  To understand it best, perhaps it's nice to know that this is happening in the context of 6 weeks without any other impositions than studying for exams, and computer use is not necessary for these courses.  

**1)** Strict adherence to basic simple small set of fundamental behaviors and evaluating/evolving this set when appropriate, i.e. after exams:

-  **Taking sleep seriously**.  If poor sleep for more than 2 days/I really start to feel it, timeout, take sleep and relaxation that night seriously &amp; no caffeine the next day.
-  **No eating any food not prepped at home. No junk food/stuff with added sugar** (which is really easy and lovely every time I wait out the urges that last a couple days).
-  **No internet at home period** (except banking).  For example, for making plans with friends on facebook, I literally go outside to use public wifi.  Hassle  but priority = not fuck up something I know works.  No internet at home I think is the most crucial factor.  (No porn incidentally)
-  **Exercise**: gym 2-3x/week + abs at home 2-3x/week.  

**2)** Mindfulness building and maintenance activities.  Taking interest in expanding mindfulness/spirituality.  Mindfulness for me = staying close to how I'm truly feeling, which allows intuiting better actions.  And spirituality for me would be how I feel in this world as myself, impacting other living beings.  In a nutshell.  Want to take mindfulness sufficiently seriously this time because it seems to be a necessary and sufficient condition for being free from negative things, and I'd very much like to have more stable moods.  Also as an added bonus it makes everything about life better.

Same thing: interested in basic set of immutable, strict behaviors for time being that are subject to evaluation and evolution.  Basis set so far:

-  **Meditation for 8 min. every day or other day**. 


-  Spiritual reading: now ""Emotional Intelligence"" by Daniel Goleman.  Reading on reasonably frequent basis.  Not super strict about this

Would like:

-  To become friends with my family dog this summer.  Really paying attention to this and trying to be mindful to this.  I know that I've long felt I would like to experience this with him during my lifetime and this would just be really nice.
-  Therapy sessions, i.e. getting a therapist and starting work there. (Been stalled on this front recently due to administrative problems - so as soon as this opens up I'm in)
-  Taking a larger interest in understanding (different) people: (for example, LGBT+ people)
-  Record as I'm slipping in an important behavior instead of ignoring it.  For example, I've been trying to cut down on caffeine which has not been as linear.  Making objective notes about it.
-  Taking actions towards making the things I want to do be the things I have to do: MA thesis is something I am very excited to do; spoke w/ some professors today about things including how to achieve this, this kind of thing...
  
Any feedback/ideas you guys might have in response to any things I've discussed would be super appreciated!  I'm especially interested in feedback on the healthy porn use idea (as a concept! not necessarily something I'm actually interested in!) and the idea of mindfulness/whatever happens to float your boat being a reliable tool/necessary&amp;sufficient condition for significantly increasing stability/controllability of living well. 

**PS**: YBOP (Your Brain on Porn) is an excellent resource for getting a pretty good condensation of science concerning the (negative) effects of porn use on the brain as well as a deep explanation of the addictive process.  Does something similar exist for understanding what happens to our brains not using porn?  I feel it would be very interesting to really rationally understand the various things so many people report: increased creativity, increased self-confidence, increased natural desire to socialize, ..., all these markers of basic and deep increased life enjoyment."
8mr5jw,4,2018-05-28,"Close to graduating, was told im overqualified for an internship",aLL1_ISE,industrialengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/industrialengineering/comments/8mr5jw/close_to_graduating_was_told_im_overqualified_for/,"I just got rejected by a major Auto manufacturer for being ""overqualified"" and need advice on how to adjust my strategy.

First of all, I'm a second generation mid 30 year old American born male. I have 3 children and a wife who's taken time off work to raise them.

I decided to go back to school in late 2015, because I saw the writing on the wall and needed to future proof myself. Good thing I did, because Amazon put the retail company I was the national training director of out of business in late 2016.

I did a shift to a small business in Healthcare, and am currently the chief operating officer of six clinics and 32 employees, but things don't look good on the horizon for small practices in Healthcare.

I'm set to graduate in Fall 2019 with a BS in Industrial and Systems Engineering, and my plan is to work in manufacturing, learn the tools for process improvement, optimization, etc., then work on an MBA. 

I understand that I need an internship if I want any hope of a job in manufacturing, and so I jumped at the chance when a special program at our University was presented that guarantees an internship with a as of now 100% job placement at one of the big three auto makers.

I spoke to the professor in charge of the program, gave him a copy of my resume, and explained my family situation. I let him know that I'm willing to do what it takes, and that I'll resign from my high paying position when I'm offered the internship a semester before graduating. 

Also, the job requires a minimum 3.0 gpa, and although my overall is 2.61, my core is 3.33 at this time and rising. (I was at this University years ago and have a few 0s from dropping out without withdrawing in back in 2005.)

So Friday I meet with the professor, and he informs me that he had just left a meeting with the committee that decides which students can get into this sheet metal forming program, and they told him I was overqualified.

He said my overall GPA they can overlook as long as I keep above a 3.0 in all future semesters, but when one of them scanned down and saw Chief Operating Officer and National Training Director on my resume, she said there's no way they're taking the risk. 

Apparently two years ago they let a student who had management experience into the program, and the guy never showed up to the internship because he was offered a higher salary and a full time job with benefits from a competitor.

Therefore, the professor told me I could still enroll in the program, but the three 2-credit classes would not be reimbursed, and I would not be able to get an internship with the Auto company but could try Tier 1 suppliers.

My only hope from his point of view was to either apply for full time positions near graduation or to seriously dumb down my resume to look like clerical jobs were held to help pay for tuition while dyeing the few grays I have popping up on my beard so that I can land an internship.

I was told by another mentor that this sheet metal forming program is a way to get engineers hired in as glorified techs with lower pay, and it's better to pass on it and get in through the front door as an entry level engineer.

I need advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation or can share insight on how I can strategize jump starting a career in manufacturing. 

Although there's many opportunities for an ISE in healthcare and other fields, I'm set on manufacturing, because I was told that I will learn the most tools and have an opportunity to branch into other fields later. I was also told that starting in a niche market like healthcare would pigeonhole me there for the rest of my career, and it would be very difficult to switch out if needed.

More relevant information:

I will be taking my PMP certification by early fall, and I have a working knowledge of lean six sigma with 7 years of upper management experience and another 8 in sales and marketing. 

Product management has been suggested as a goal after entry level manufacturing engineering, process improvement or plant design.

I have very little interest in quality Engineering.

Longer term goal is MBA and either upper level management or consulting.

Thank you for taking the time to read and comment."

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

I don't have much experience aside from selling stuff at home via eBay and Amazon and a one year internship I did back when I was a senior at high school. I'm 26 and have a bachelor's degree from CSUN in English. I've probably applied to 60 jobs in the area and none are hiring me or even getting back. Even things like McDonald's and retail aren't hiring.

What sort of places can I go and apply for? It's not like a production company or game company is going to hire me, but those would be the ideal places for me, anyway.

I have some physical limitations and get tired easily, but most places would be alright.

All I've got to my name is someone who is good with computers (without the documentation for it), coming up with stories, and a can-do attitude."

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I have an internship interview with a State Circuit Court Judge tomorrow morning, and I am supposed to bring with me a writing sample and a copy of my law school transcript. I just finished my 1L year with an offer to work at a plaintiff medmal firm, however, the attorney under whom I was to work ended up taking an assistant prosecutor job. One of the partners decided to run for judge, and his son decided to run for the State Senate. They had to pull my offer and I found out on the first day of finals.

With that being said, my summary judgment memo for the semester was actual trash, and I've decided to reformat my constitutional law final exam \(which was a take home final in memo form\). However, I did not do an introduction for my exam. I just included a statement of facts and analyses. The question is centered around a fictional town's 1955 zoning regulations which included a ban on multi\-family units and a 1972 municipal residence requirement for the city's professional jobs. My main arguments are that the '55 regulation is unconstitutional because the right of family members to live together has been recognized as a fundamental right under *Moore v. City of East Cleveland* and that the '72 municipal residence requirement is probably unconstitutional based on dicta fr*om United Building and Construction Trades Council v. Camd*en.

Any tips on structuring an introduction for this? I am racking my brain and this interview has me terrified! Any help would be greatly appreciated and allow me to take advantage of a great opportunity.

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

Hey guys and girls! I want to play out a story with you that involves a desperate, slutty Asian college student. Girls, we can either set up an FF or FFM scenario, whichever you enjoy more :) or just chat about dirty ideas!

Note: I might not be able to play consecutively for long amounts of time, if we click I'm happy to go long term!

If you want to play, just message me which kind of scenario you might be interested in and what your favorite race of Asian sluts is your favorite!

***

I was a repressed teen going through a sexual transformation. After my incredibly virginal high school years at a very conservative school, watched closely by my helicopter parents, I was finally at college. Being a cute, slender Asian girl, I naturally got a lot of attention and, with my hormones going wild, I started going through a crazy boy phase.

My standards - what standards? I want dick. I want to fuck. All of my insecurities and resentments and guilt made me turn into a crazy slut overnight. But who are you exactly? How do you find your way to this desperate Asian chick determined to spend every night in someone else's bed?

I loooove raceplay. Please include it with our roleplay! Are you a white guy ready to pump some yellow pussy full of your cum? Are you a black dude ready to pound some Asian ass? Are you an Asian dude sick of seeing this cute Asian girl grinding on white dudes, who angrily gets a hold of me and fucks my brains out in a frat bro's room?

Kinks: Raceplay, cuckolding, degradation, rough sex, dirty talk, humiliation, spanking, oral, cumplay, dressup/outfits.

Just ideas: 

- the Professor: I come to your office hours, dressed somewhat provocatively. You're married with kids, but you flirt with me and, loving the attention, I reciprocate the interest. Bonus to old, geeky, dirty men.

- the Grad Student Instructor: Similar to the above, but with a younger grad student. Love even including predatory/grooming aspects lol.

- Frat Party Hoe: Either a frat bro or a friend of one? Grind me hard and humiliate me in front of everyone. Do I suck your dick in public at a party? Are you clearly feeling me up during beer pong? Or do you fuck me right in front of my guy friends on a bed?

- [Cuckold](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/67tpmf/f4a_asians/): Are you my best friend, my brother, my cousin, etc? Or a friend crushing on me who's only seen my good girl side? Maybe we go out to a frat or house party and you find my inner hoe when I start sucking the first white or black guy I see there.

- [Asian Gals](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ao86a/f4a_asian_girl/): Dirty as fuck :P so I'm going to start writing some scenario ideas for girls! Haven't gotten any yet so I hope to attract some of y'all 

- [Non-Asian Gals]:

I have so many ideas and I love brainstorming with y'all!

**Asian Women in Business Association:** AWBA is a strong club on campus for Asian girls who want to be strong business leaders. We have lots of outreach events, we get our members excellent internships and jobs, and have huge donations from industry. That's because of the great climate of supporting women and minorities, right?

Wrong. AWBA has a secret approach - targeting the yellow fever of successful white men. Sophia Chen's internship at that big bank? She was the CEO's mistress. Amy Liu? She's the ""diversity chair"", making $500,000 a year introducing the executives and top investors to ""Asian issues"". All of these members give back and all Asian-crazed white executives know about us and donate for our attention.

* Learn Japanese as much as I can while finishing my bachelor's. (year 1)

* Find a Software development related job while (or after) language school, (+ sponsoring my visa). 
* Change visa status to ""work-visa""

Will this long-term plan work?

* I am a very good learner. But 2 years (1 self + 1 in a language school) enough for N2?  

* Can I get a company to sponsor me with only a Bachelor's degree and N2 (only internship experience in home country)                                                          "

# The adventures of Margaret &amp; Theobold

Chapter 1: Mirror Man

Margaret was old, she thought looking at herself in the mirror. A bit stooped, her hair white as snow and curly, a bit of a loose neck and a veiny button nose. She looked every bit a grandmother, in her bright blue wool cardigan, plaid ankle length skirt and simple, practical shoes. At seventy\-nine years and some change she felt every bit as old as she looked. It didn’t help that the damn economy in Grintsgaurd had collapsed thanks to the Gnomish Bankers Rebellion thirty odd years ago and had never fully recovered. She had lost her job as a secretary at the Alchemists Guild and was had been forced to find work cleaning for the local Sorcerous, Lady Varragand the Strange. All in all, it had been an uneventful twenty some years. At least as uneventful as being a house keeper for a powerful witch can be.

Today would prove to be altogether different. Here she was, scrubbing Her Ladyships looking glass in the privy, and generally minding her own business as best as a seventy\-nine\-year\-old peasant woman can. When out of nowhere a rather odd\-looking wizard appeared nary an inch from her nose. Startled, the old woman let out a bit of squawk and ducked to the other side of the mirror. Having been employed by the Countess Varragand for these past twenty\-odd years it was no surprise for the odd Wizard or Warlock to come visiting in strange hours of the day, but this was something else. Who tries to come in through the privy mirror? Maybe the Grand Mirror in the Grand Hall, or the Great Mirror in the Great Hall. Or even the Mirror for Lesser Guests in the Hall of the Slightly Unwanted, but certainly not the privy mirror, it didn’t even warrant a capital P. Yet here he was, standing in her half\-cleaned mirror picking gormlessly at his teeth.

“Most inappropriate indeed,” she mumbled to herself as she recovered from her fright and straightened her ruffled fleeces before glancing back up at the looking\-glass.

The man in the mirror was wearing blue shirt tucked into blue pants with a thick black belt and large silver shield pinned to his top. His hat, though certainly impressive was far from wizardly thought Margaret. It had a sufficiently large brim for a wizard’s hats, but the tip wasn't nearly pointed enough and was a bit to rounded. Not proper at all really. Worst of all were his shoes, they were black, shiny and far to soldierly for a wizard. No point, nor curl, no bells to be seen anywhere on them.

""Hello?"" said Margaret as she peaked back around the mirrors edge. ""May I help you, Master Wizard?"". He may be appearing in the privy, and be oddly dressed, but there's no reason to be rude she thought.

“Hello?” she said again, a bit more haughtily then before. After all it was HER work being interrupted by some improper looking sorcerer.

After a moment with no response she decided enough was enough and brought herself up right in front of the mirror and the damnable man that was apparently ignoring her.

“Listen here you. I don’t care if you’re a master of all seventy\-seven curses, the four elements, shifter of the five forms and Lord the three toads!”, she barked. “When someone my age getting paid my wages takes the time from her busy schedule to be polite you had best reply!”.

Still nothing, in fact she wasn’t even sure the man had heard her. He seemed to simply be preening himself in the mirror. Peering closer she could see the room he was in. It was large, built from gray stone walls and was filled with racks upon racks of long, oddly shaped metal wands. Each one looked to have a moderately sized metal box sitting beside it.

At that moment, the Blue Wizard, as she had come to think of the man, appeared to get distracted and wandered off out of her view. Margaret waited for a few minutes, but he didn’t come back to the Mirror. Now you must understand that Margaret Ethels\-Daughter was an upstanding old woman. She cleaned where she was told to clean when she was told, and, in her opinion, she did a very fine job whilst doing her best not to get involved in anything unseemly or overly unnatural.

That said, after working for a sorcerous of Lady Varragand’s skill for as long as she had you are bound to pick up a few magical tricks of your own. One skill Margaret had mastered was Mirror Walking. After all, her Ladyship, being as vein as her kind are wont to be, had a mirror in nearly every room in her fortress. Hell, the old crone had three in her bedroom alone, one of which dangled rather precariously above the bed. So of course, Margaret had learned rather quickly how to use them to walk through rooms, it was quite a bit faster than carrying her cleaning supplies up all those stairs to every room in this oversized monstrosity of castle. She had even used her skill to take a vacation to the Elvish Isle of GlitterRoot a few years back. Now that is a story for another day I tell you. So, what was stopping her from taking a quick peak into the Blue Wizard’s wand room? He had left the Mirror unsecured and therefore the door open, she thought.

Her mind made up, Margaret pulled the mirror off its hanger, placed it on the floor began tracing the outline of a door onto the mirrors surface. “Mirror, mirror on the floor, would please open your door?” she chanted as she finished tracing out the last bit of the doorway. Once done she leaned around the edge, double checking to make sure the wizard was in fact gone. “Coasts clear dearie.” She said to herself as she stepped through the water\-like surface of the now open mirror door.

After the cool, wet feeling of passing through the Door, Margaret found herself standing the large gray room she had seen from the privy. Everything was as she had seen before. Rows of shelves filled with jackets, and pants and boots. Racks with heavy looking black vests on them and of course the many strange metal wands she had seen earlier.

Wandering over to the first set of wands, Margaret prized one from it holder and gave it a quick look. It was very heavy for wand, made primarily out of what seemed to steel with a long round tube of black metal, that had a similar but smaller one below, what she thought of as a broom\-ish looking back end, and a large wooden pump on the bottom of the second tube.

Raising the wand one handed seemed nearly impossible to Margaret, so instead she settled it up against her shoulder, as one might do with a crossbow. The with a bit of a flourish she nimbly guided the open end in a quick figure eight.

“In pulchra flores avase!”, she said with gusto.

Nothing happened.

“Lucerna Lumen!”, she cried again, this time making sure to enunciate her vowels as she’d learned in during her internship with Master Merry’s Magical Maids and Butlery. Yet, this spell proved to be as much a dud as the last one.

“Hmmph, what a load of rubbish.”, decried Margaret with bit of snarl, “This wand’s as useful as a lucernian five\-legged toad, and ten times as damned heavy.”

Margaret set the heavy metal wand down, and then decided that there was quite a bit more oddness going on in this wizard’s coat room than she had previously noticed. Just why did a one wizard need so many hats, and in so many styles? Not to mention that everything was the same shade of midnight blue, a most unwizardly color. No flourish, not pretention anywhere to be seen, just a kind of military efficiency. Wandering around she spied a few other interesting things, row of shields made of some sort of glass, some oddly shaped helmets with the same clear glass visors as the shields, and several small clubs like a constable might use.

That’s when it her.

“This is no ordinary wizardly wardrobe, no these must be some sort of sorcerous constabulary.” She muttered to herself. That in itself was strange, the one wizard’s constable force that she knew of was found far to the east in the great Empire of Naand, and she had met one such a few years back. His uniform had been a bright canary yellow robe, with a spangled mauve hat and appropriately pointed shoes with little silver bells, most properly sorcerous, unlike these drab blue things she kept seeing.

Wandering back over to where she had left the strange wand, Margaret noticed a few other things as well. The boxes she had seen setting beside the wands were each marked, “Ammunition 12Ga.”, as well as others that read similarly but ended with 9mm, whatever that meant. Picking the wand back up she began to look it over, on one side of the tube, next to what looked like a shrunk down version of a crossbows trigger, were the words “Mossberg M 500”, and just below that “12Ga, 3/4in.”

“Well, how about that,” said Margaret. “I wonder if this pointlessly oversized matchstick needs whatever in that box to caste a proper spell.” After all, leave it to foreign wizards to over complicate something a simple as wand work by adding extra bit and pieces. Reaching over to the box, she hefted it up and looked about for a way to open the large metal latch holding it closed. Margaret quickly grasped that the latch was in fact how it opened and gave it a good hard yank.

“Bugger!”, she yelped as several elongated cartridges flew from the top, she’d overestimated how tight the lid was and spilled the things all over.

“Leave it to you Margaret, who knows how many years of cleaning this, and that and you can’t even open a box?”, she grumbled to herself as she dashed here and there about the room picking up the little rolling cartridges.

Having gatheedr them all up, she looked about and found herself a nice low bench to sit on while she tried to work out how to get one of the “Shells”, as she thought of them, into the wand.

“Damn you, just open already ya fool thing!”, growled Margaret while she gave the wand a hard, frustrated shake. That’s when she noticed a little opening on the bottom of the trigger area of the wand. Giving it a quick wiggle with her finger she found that it pushed up, revealing a little hole, about the right shape as one of the round shells she had found in the box.

Margaret popped one into the chamber, it slid in smoothly, then she tried another, and then another until she had five sunk into the second tube under the wands main body. “Now, how about that, clever bit of work there, must be dwarfish make.” She said to herself, sa far as she knew only dwarves, the tinkerers that they were, came up with interesting things like this. It reminded her a bit of the dwarfish revolving bolt thrower that she’d once seen a soldier carrying during the war. Which war she couldn’t quite remember, maybe the Great War of Disunification during the second Dwarven Upheaval? No that wasn’t it, it must have been the War of the Five Fabulously Flamboyant Kings. Anyways, she thought, maybe now it’ll do a simple spell.

Giving the wands tube a good hard pull to snug it up to her shoulder, which then slid one of the shells into the wands chamber, she pointed it at one of the odd wizard’s hats, once again gave her new wand a flourish and said, “nova nexu simili coherebunt!”, once again nothing.

“Oh toads spittle.’, she cursed, quite frustrated at this point, “I forgot to pull the damn trigger, this is what happens when foreign wizards get foreign dwarves to make a wand!”

This time Margaret was determined to make the fool thing do something. Setting her feet and snugging the wand to her shoulder once again she pointed it square at the stupid, blue, not quite pointy enough hat and shouted, “Flexilis anatis!”, with all her might while pulling the trigger.

With a crack as loud as the Killing Curse, the wand kicked, and the hat, instead of turning into a bright yellow rubber ducky, exploded. That’s when the alarms went off."

**Without further ado, let's begin!**

* Q1: Your first patient is a 2-month old Basic Pokémon, male gender, who presents to the PC with vomiting and diarrhea of three-days duration. His trainer first noticed something was awry when instead of using Hydro Pump during a battle, what came out was…Muddy Water. You would think having a clear body would’ve prevented the status effects of acute gastroenteritis! Name that Pokémon. 

* Q2: Your next patient is a ten-year old Bibarel who presents with three days of altered mental status, increased salivation, and hydrophobia. Bibarel’s trainer said that while he is still able to use Surf, Bibarel isn’t able to swallow or drink any fluids the last two days. The trainer remembers that a few months ago Bibarel came out of a wild Pokémon encounter in Union Cave with some nasty-looking bites. What could have bitten Bibarel in the cave?

* Q3: A 28-year old pregnant Alolan woman comes to the PC in acute distress. At her recent OB appointment, her antibody titers for Toxoplasma gondii have come back positive, and she’s worried for her unborn child. Besides consoling your patient and referring her for medical management, you ask a few questions about potential sources of exposure for your patient. She says that a certain species of Pokémon fails to use the litter box and often leaves droppings around her house. What’s that species of Pokémon?

* Q4: Your next patient is brought in by a desperate-looking young lass. She is distressed because she noticed her Pokémon has gotten bigger in the last day, and has been unable to take off its headgear. Physical exam reveals significant ossification of the Pokemon’s headgear, but you assure the lass that her Pokémon is in perfectly good health. What Pokémon did the lass bring in?

* Q5: A pompous, bratty medical student comes into your clinic, claiming that his recently hatched Squirtle has congenital birth defects. The student believes that his Pokémon’s macrosomia, absence of a shell, and macroglossia are signs of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. He also dislikes his Pokémon’s rather oblivious disposition. Upon further examination, you realize the doltish medical student has actually confused his species of Pokémon, because what hatched from his egg was actually what species of Pokémon?

* Q6: After your lunch break, your next patient is a one-month old Teddiursa brought in by her Pokémon breeder. The breeder noticed that Teddiursa looks increasingly tired, with droopy eyelids, and feels quite “floppy” when picked up. She also tells you that her Teddiursa has been learning to gather honey. You have a diagnosis in mind, and quickly rush out to the nearby Poké-Mart to purchase what status condition healing item? Assume the mart has run out of Full Heals/Full Restores and does not stock generation-specific items (Lava Cookie, Big Malasada, etc).

* Q7: Last patient of the day! An 8 year-old boy dressed in a ninja costume comes into the PC complaining of shortness of breath. Physical exam notable for nonproductive Koffing and low-pitched end-expiratory Wheezing. He ain’t a Pokémon, and you ain’t a doctor, but you’re smart enough to recognize and treat his symptoms. What’s your diagnosis? (Sorry, I couldn’t resist the bad puns!)

Good luck, and I hope you enjoyed the contest! "
8mu5zh,151,2018-05-28,"Update #2: Psychiatrist told me I need to move out ASAP, by any means necessary.",oe_94,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8mu5zh/update_2_psychiatrist_told_me_i_need_to_move_out/,"Hello all. I DID IT, I MOVED OUT THE FIRST OF MAY. I'm finally in a position to post another update. It's been crazy, fun, exhilarating, terrifying, depressing and just plain emotional since my last post (I cry a lot now but I take it as a good thing since I don't have to bottle my emotions anymore). I hope this post isn't too long since I have a lot to say. This sub is like my second family so I'd like to share how it's been. This post will consist of what my life has been like since leaving.

Original post: https://redd.it/81iiiz
First update: https://redd.it/85x37k

Important stuff first! I told my dad and brother 2 days before moving out that I was doing so. That brother told my mom that I was moving out as well. I hadn't spoken to her since October so her finding out that way was not my plan. He had this really weird conversation with me the day before I moved out. He told me I was immature, selfish, childish, and mean for treating my mom this way. None of that conversation took how I felt into consideration. He told me that I should just let her treat me that way because she is my mom. I'm not mad at my brother, he doesn't know any better yet because of my parents and I hope one day he does. My other brother told me the same thing. My dad ended up trying to guilt me into talking to her. He used the old ""you never know how long some people will be on this earth"" line on me. He essentially told me I needed to change for her because she wouldn't. I told him that was a load of crap and that he really shouldn't be trying to manipulate me into doing this. I also called him out on the fact that he would not be advocating for peace between my mom and I unless there was some way he can benefit from it. 
I walked into my parents house the first of the month and told her that I was leaving, then proceeded to gather all of my stuff and pack. She just said that I was free to do whatever I wanted and that if that was what I wanted to do with my life, then she wouldn't stop me. I went back on the 3rd for few more of my things and had a short conversation with her about what I had been doing with my life lately and gave vague details about where I would be living. She hugged me before I left and said ""please talk to me."" I don't know how to feel about that statement, nothing about it was cathartic. I called her on mothers day but haven't had any contact since. My dad has texted me a few times about car insurance and mail that I need to pick up at their place. I'm going back tomorrow to pick up my mail and chat with them for a bit. I hope it keeps them off my back for a bit. I know I said a million times that I would go NC when I moved out but I still have loose ends to tie up at home. As soon as I feel the need to distance myself from them more I will. I want to be there for my brothers however, my parents will continue to damage them until they leave as well. So far this break from my family is good. The things I felt while living with them are slowly withering away. Other unintended emotions are taking their place however(more about that later).

The loan came through not long after my first update. I sat on the money for a bit looking for a place. Everyone that I mentioned in my last post either flaked or didn't come through when it came to seriously speaking about getting a place together. A friend of a friend that I've known for years was willing and able. He was ready to move out and everything. I was looking for a place to house us both when I came across a room for rent in a very middle class city 15 minutes away from my parents. The rent was $600, I went to go look at it and 4 days later I moved in. Not living in the ghetto is peaceful, I can walk around without having to look over my shoulder. Told him about what I had done and he was cool with it, he's been very chill and understanding. He knows how hard it is to find a place. Ironically he ended up getting a place with his mom in the same city.

I also have a job now! I work in the same restaurant as the girl I mentioned in my last post. She put in a good word for me with her managers and they interviewed me and hired me as a busser. I'm doing great there. The last job I had in the service industry was the 1.5 years I spent barbacking/bartending at a high volume dive bar/night club. It was the most challenging job I've ever had. People kept telling me that if you can make it there you can make it anywhere. So far I believe that statement because I find my current job quite easy. This place is enormous and has tons of tables, booths, and a massive bar. I've been able to keep up with the work not matter how busy they are. In my down time I clean things that I notice other people don't. I've also taken it upon myself to look around for things that need maintenance/are broken so that management can address it before it becomes a problem. Management and several other employees have complimented me on how good/fast I am. Being recognized for the hard work you do feels so good and rewarding, it motivates me to work even harder. I went from working 2 days a week to 5 since I finished school 2 weeks ago. They've given me shifts that are usually occupied by bussers that management gets complaints about. If I keep it up the managers will continue to give me better hours and I'll make more to keep myself afloat!

School has been a mess in my opinion. Even though I got 3 A's and 1 F for my last semester at community college I feel like I barely scraped by. I didn't learn a thing in one of my classes. I got lucky and someone gave me their answers to a take home physics exam, thanks to them I got a perfect score. I heard back from the 5 UC's and 2 CSU's I applied to. Not a single UC accepted me and 1 CSU denied me. I only got into one school so that's where I'll be going in the fall. I am absolutely devastated at this result. I spent 5 years in community college. Running clubs, extracurricular activities, volunteering, attending NASA internships, and being a member of the honors student program. None of that got me into a UC. What makes me feel so bitter and defeated about it all is that if my initial intention was to go to a CSU I could have transferred 2 years ago and have received my bachelors LAST WEEK. I put in so much extra effort to be able to get into a UC and I didn't. I wanted to attend a UC because I would like to conduct research. I feel so useless and defeated. Like despite everything I went through spending those extra 2 years in college, I have nothing to show for it. I am honestly not taking it very well. I have so many feelings about my academic future that I don't even know what to do with myself anymore. I haven't been able to stop crying. I think it's going to take me a long time to accept these facts.
I am however getting a very handsome amount of financial aid from the CSU I will be attending. I won't have to pay for tuition either. Coming from a very poor family has allowed the state to help me out a lot with paying for school.

Mods if this next part is not entirely suited for this sub I am more than willing to remove this post and discuss how it can be made so. Regardless, this is the most significant part of my journey since leaving home because I am learning how to love myself and be good to other people.

The girl I've been seeing is absolutely incredible. I've never been treated this way by anyone ever. It's a shock to the soul when someone treats you like you are a valuable and worthy human being. She helped me get a job, gave me a place to sleep when I needed it most, gave me somewhere to shower, gave me somewhere to prepare my food, let me borrow a book about toxic parents, and most importantly a safe space to be myself. We began hanging out more until I was at her place 4-5 days a week. When we first started hanging out we admitted that we had been admiring each other from afar, I've known her through a mutual friend for almost 3 years. We also noted that we are both not over our exes, not in any position to be in a serious committed relationship, not looking for anything serious, and are willing to give each other any kind of space needed. Spending time with her is absolute bliss, and we've both admitted that we make each other feel a certain type of way. Emotions were confessed and we grew even closer. 
Don't forget that her and I are very very similar people, a friend of mine went so far as to say that I was dating myself. Given that we are so similar she also comes from a very similar family except that she tries to maintain some sort of relationship with her parents as well as maintains an extremely close relationship with her siblings.
Things started to get a little weird between us last week. We are both dealing with a lot of trauma still, and have so much going on in our personal life. I think it got to her or she felt that it was going to blow up in her face because we sat down to talk about where we are at this past Thursday. Thanks to therapy and this sub I've learned so much about what it means to treat someone like they are a valuable human being. I asked how she was doing and feeling, mentioned that I was willing and ready to listen to whatever she had to say, offered to clean up her place for letting me crash there, always listened when she was speaking, took how she felt into consideration. I took every step to make sure that I was being the best person I could be, being treated so nicely by her compelled me to reciprocate. I even went so far as to buy her some household supplies that I noticed she was running low on. I spent so much time there that we both kind of neglected our personal lives. We spent so much time revolving around each other that our personal lives began to strain. I was always there at her request.
She began the conversation by stating that she feels like this is turning into a relationship. She brought up that we both stated that we aren't mutually exclusive since the beginning. I hadn't been seeing anyone else since her because I enjoyed her company so much. She said that she could not be in a relationship, and doesn't want to be. She said that her ex was the total opposite of me. No one has ever treated her as good as I do or made her feel as good as I do. That she is not used to it, it makes her a little nervous and uncertain. She also mentioned that she enjoys every moment she spends with me. I asked her if she wanted me to give her some space and she said that is not what she wanted. She said that she's not really sure what she wants and that recent life events regarding her family have thrown her into an existential crisis. I didn't say much because I wanted to give her room to express herself. I drove her home after that conversation and thanked her for telling me how she feels. I began to share how I felt about it a little but she asked if we could continue some other time. She had to go get ready for work. I cried on the drive home. I walked into my room and bawled into my pillow for 15 minutes and had to go to work looking like I had just cried my eyes out. I'm still unsure what the conversation meant but all I know is that it made me cry that hard and has been making me cry ever since. Was it a request for space even though she didn't explicitly state it? I asked myself if this meant she didn't want to see me again. We work together one day a week and I saw her that night at work after our talk (there was undeniable tension between us). I told myself that if she didn't want to see me again she would say so. Though our messages have been much less frequent kind of like when we first started hanging out, she's still talking to me. I had to give myself a pep talk the other night. That if she wanted me to leave her alone she would say so. That I signed up for something such as this, knowing the emotional risks. That all I had to do was give her a little space and she would reach out when she wanted me to see her again. If it happens that she does not want me to come over anymore than that's okay with me. This girl is absolutely amazing and I think super highly of her. Whether or not that includes me, I want her to be happy because I feel she deserves it. It hurts and will hurt even more if that's the case but I'm not going to put what I want ahead of what she needs.

On the other hand I feel like I'm going crazy over thinking that conversation. If things were meant to end they would have, but right now they seem to be in some sort of weird limbo. I'm just going to give her space.
This has presented me with something I haven't dealt with before. Loneliness. Since I spent so much time at her place, I barely ever slept at mine. I feel like it made me a little dependent because I would always count on her inviting me over at night. I realize now that I am completely alone with all of my thoughts and emotions. I have time now to learn how to be on my own, to be by myself. To look inside myself and try to understand all of my emotions. Since I'm giving her space I have time to improve myself. To make myself a better person and discover myself completely. It's really hard, and I am so very lonely but this is something I'm going to have to endure if I want to be the best person I can be. I have a chance to forget about my love life and focus on myself. The way it should be. No matter what happens between her and I, it's time I make myself and well being my number one priority. There are a lot of things I need to work on, now I have the time and space.

I hope the last part wasn't a complete rant. I cried typing it out so I hope it's coherent and makes sense.
I will post another update when I am ready. Thank you all, I love you so much!"
8mugf5,0,2018-05-28,My search for a job in Berlin begins... I'm prepared to give it 6 months.,swampingalaxys,berlin,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/8mugf5/my_search_for_a_job_in_berlin_begins_im_prepared/,"So for the past couple of years I have had my mind firmly fixed on moving to Berlin.  The city has always appealed to me \(due to my love of electronic music, and a general gratification towards German culture since I was young\).

I'm a native English speaker and have a B.A and M.A. in the social sciences \- which doesn't mean a whole lot as there is no real practical skills gained from them.  Since graduating I did a couple of low\-level internships in the charity/NGO sector, and for the past 15 months I have been working for a charity/NGO in telemarketing.  I also have a level 5 digital marketing degree from the last year.

BUT It seems in Berlin, you are naturally at a disadvantage unless you're fluent in both German and English.  I am learning German on Duolingo at the moment, but won't be even Duolingo fluent until another few months.

I really want to move to Berlin \(or even Hamburg &amp; Leipzig\) and therefore I am prepared to put in serious effort to find a job including sacrificing social life \- but without German language skills, would even 6 months of non\-stop searching be a waste?"
8musc7,35,2018-05-28,How do you calculate fluid/sodium replacement in a hyponatremic patient in the practice setting?,avaprolol,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/8musc7/how_do_you_calculate_fluidsodium_replacement_in_a/,"Soon to be pharmacist with a question for you guys \- I tried asking this in r/pharmacy and got very little as a response.  
\-\-\-\-\-

We've had an unfortunate situation with an ODS patient secondary to inappropriate fluid bolusing. This has caused quite a discussion amongst the pharmacists I work with \(as an intern\) on the appropriate way to calculate this and it was found that people were doing it very differently. 

One report in the incident was that there was no weight recorded for the patient so it was not possible to calculate a safe rate. However some pharmacists feel like you don't need a weight at all and you can use a generally safe rate \(they did not elaborate on what this generally safe rate is or how to calculate it\).

The other issue is choosing a target sodium level. Most can agree upon 120 to 125 as a range to choose. However, they cannot decide upon a cut\-off for determining when you use 120 or 125.

We also realized that pharmacists were using different references for their calculations. Some were using old school notes while others were using MDcalc and global rph.

I have never actually had to calculate this yet in practice. Is there a generally agreed\-upon way to do it? How are you doing it in practice? You can use hypothetical numbers or generalize for different etiologies \(ETOH pt\) if it's easier to explain with an example."

I'm a new grad with internship experience in Java and C#, 

But my go to tool is Python as it's really easy for me to prototype small projects out and there's a lot of friendly libraries out there for the work I like to do (serverside development). 

Based on the go tour, it seems go is most similar to c/ c++

I've taken a course in c and c++ but it's never been my strong suit. 

In addition to go tour I plan on doing a side project to familiarize myself with the language and common packages. 

However I'm finding it hard to wrap my head around go syntactically (and I suppose conceptually) as far as go tour goes, I'm just finishing the control structures.

Some of the syntax has been a little strange for me to understand like these short ifs, or the 2 statement for loop, i guess it reads weird to me.

Any how I was wondering if there was anyone else who had a similar background and had some resources for learning go?

I think it's pretty cool and I'm sure I'll get it eventually I'm just wondering if anyone could point me to anything to ease the learning? "
8mvnb0,9,2018-05-28,Rules of Engagement - Siblings Romances,alaniastar,Choices,https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/8mvnb0/rules_of_engagement_siblings_romances/,"I just played through all of Red Carpet Diaries, The Royal Romance and Rules of Engagement to get diamonds to replay Endless Summer (which is my favourite).

Despite myself I fell in love with Rules of Engagement and spent all my diamonds.

However! I wasn’t super interested in the main character’s storyline or love interests. (Mild Spoilers!!)
.

All of the suitors proposed to me but I didn’t really know who to choose. Each suitor was both right and wrong for me. I was originally 110% team William but then they changed his look, he ordered food for me, and then that whole business with the lawyer. I didn’t think we would be happy long. I ended up choosing Leo but he kinda reminds me of Chris in the Freshman.... I need a little conflict to stay engaged.

But I LOVED the sibling side plots! I spent diamonds on Party Sister (I called her Emma), brother (I called him Jeremy) and Violet’s stories.  I loved the fact that none of these romances were perfect and there were things to hate about each of these siblings and dumb things they did.  The only one I felt was more lukewarm than MC was Nerdy Twin (I called her Emily). I really wanted her to keep her internship and make up with Paulo and have them work together.

Am I alone in these thoughts?"
8mvtqx,74,2018-05-28,Successful First Try!,onmyshoulder,nonmonogamy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/8mvtqx/successful_first_try/,"My spouse and I have considered ourselves firmly nonmonogamous since about 6 months after our wedding. We dated four five years prior to getting married, and even before the wedding spoke about it and considered having an open relationship or generally being non-monogamous long before, and in fact at one point my girlfriend (now wife) slept with a very close friend of both of ours. After we got married, we sort of put those conversations on the back burner as we adjusted to living together really for the first time (we had been sort of on-and-off long distance for much of our relationship, as college, my internships and work, and hers didn’t always line up). But after we began to adjust to our new life together and began to open up, my spouse began to understand that she did not feel like she fit into the traditional binary gendered system, and that although she was certainly attracted to me, most her attractions were to women and not men.

As we began getting comfortable having these conversations and she dealt with the frustration, anxiety, and burden of learning things about herself that she was raised to believe were “wrong” or “abnormal,” we began to revisit the status of our relationship and what we needed. We both mutually decided that although we are totally and primarily committed to each other emotionally, that there was no reason that we couldn’t or shouldn’t explore expanding the scope of our relationship. Of course we didn’t really have a particular sense for what exactly we *wanted* from relationships outside of ours together, but we were open to explore. I wanted to support her exploring her sexuality as she learned more about herself, particularly since we were each others’ firsts and (up until the time she slept with our friend) our only sexual experiences. 

Fast forward six months and we’ve really adopted and begun to feel very comfortable in our status as a non-monogamous married couple. And although neither of us had gone and sought out other relationships, felt like either one of us *could* should we be so inclined. My spouse would periodically browse Tinder or spend time at the local clubs’ gay nights to drink and dance with other people, but my more introverted self hadn’t done any of this (add that to the fact that my luck on Tinder and Bumble had been so absolutely abysmal that I gave up and deleted my profiles altogether). That is, until a few weeks ago, when we shared a hotel room with that friend my spouse had slept with - Joe. The three of us had all been volunteering away from home, and we decided to split the cost of the hotel room to save money.

That evening, we got to talking and discussing relationships when Joe ventured “you know, (my girlfriend) said something the other day that I thought was interesting. She said that ‘if and when we eventually swing, I’d be okay with exploring with /u/onmyshoulder and Mrs. OnMyShoulder.’” We were pretty intrigued by that, and after going home my spouse and I spent a little time talking about the possibility. The mere idea was nerve-wracking but exciting to me - I’d even never had any sexual experience with anyone but my spouse, much less an experience outside of a relationship. My spouse and I discussed what our desires were, what our best-case scenarios were, and whether we wanted to set any rules and boundaries. We decided that outside of using protection, we didn’t have any hard limits, but that we would use a key phrase to signal to the other that we needed to get out if one of us got uncomfortable. Over the course of the last week, the four of us all spent some time texting, making sure we all had similar intentions and that we were clear that if anyone was uncomfortable all they had to do was say the word and we’d all stop immediately.

This past Friday, we had Joe and his girlfriend over along with a number of other people for a bonfire and drinks to celebrate the beginning of (what feels like) summertime. After everyone cleared out and we were all riding the high of the social energy and a pretty solid buzz from the drinks, I found myself talking a lot with Joe’s girlfriend, and starting to get a little handsy. After everyone had left, she and I found ourselves in my room together and having *quite* a good time, and then shortly after that we ended up - all four of us - in my bed, all mutually enjoying one another and having the kind of fun that absolutely exceeded what until that point were some of my wildest dreams.

I don’t really know what the point of this post is - maybe just to share a story, or an experience, or whatever. At the end of the day, I know that this could have just been a one-off experience - me having sex with another woman and then having a foursome with my spouse and her boyfriend - but I feel like this was exactly what I needed my first foray into non-monogamy to be. I’m not sure if we really consider ourselves poly, but for me sex is something that I feel is so personal that the thought of sleeping with someone I just met is incredibly intimidating, where, conversely, I make such deep connections and care so closely about my good friends that the thought of sharing a sexual relationship with them is totally intuitive for me. So to have an experience with a couple I know, trust, and love along with my wonderful and incredible spouse, to have had a mind-blowing sexual experience with another woman and then watch my wife experience both another man *and* a woman for the first time, and then for us to wake up the next morning, talk about it, and feel closer than ever...I just feel so lucky and wanted to share!"

So I've been an intern in a web design start-up and one of my missions (I'm the only one working on digital marketing and every other kind of marketing) has been to improve the SEO on/off-page since the last 3 months. I was beginning to get some results (getting to the first page for some of our keywords) but then we began to have problems with our host server for the blog part of the website. Our website is made of the ""main website"" (on Concrete5) and a blog (on WordPress), on the same domain.

Since these problems (server down once every two hours I'd say) occurred more and more often, the website went back to the second page. So we decided to get new servers. But we encountered some problems during the transition and now it has been 3days since the blog is totally down.

So I was wondering how ""bad"" would that be for the SEO. Will it affect only the blog pages or the whole website' SEO? If we could do anything to minimize the damages...

**TL;DR: What is the impact on a website's SEO of the blog part (same domain, different host server) being down?**

I don't know if I gave all needed information to grasp the problem, so feel free to ask. And thanks a lot!"

All these beautiful women all had a few things in common. They LOVED 18 year olds, with something huge down there. And they were all competitive over whoever they found. 

One sunny day in California, a new man walked into the building. The building was known as a modelling building, a building full of studios. He wasn't a photographer, just an intern trying to get some money in this expensive state. He didn't really know what to do, he had gotten his interview and got the job rather quickly. He walked up to the woman at the front desk and asked, ""Hello, my name is Andrew Myers. I, uhhh, I had that interview a few days ago and got the job. What do I do?"" The woman tapped on her keyboard for a few seconds then answered. 

""Well Mr. Myers all you have to do is go to your right, and meet the people you'll be helping!"" She smiled and waved him away.

Andrew just shrugged and went on to the door, opening it he was greeted by the models, Rosana, Sommer, JoJo, and Cubbi. His jaw dropped. They were all beautiful, and there was so much about them. They didn't seem to notice him walk in, as their conversation went on. They were all debating on who this new guy was going to be, how big something was going to be? How, hot, he would be. 

Andrew just cleared his throat and they all stopped and looked his way, they all raised an eyebrow, in an interested way. He wasn't much in his opinion. He had black hair, green eyes, and a nice, clear jaw line. His outfit was pretty casual, his grey hoodie kept in warm enough in the cool weather. His jeans were lose but not sagging. He was on the taller end, and even had a nice build on him. Finally he spoke to the models. ""Hello ladies, I'm Andrew. And I guess I'll be your intern.""

They all just looked at each other and smiled, clearly please. 

How was this going to go on? 

HEY! So I hope that this goes with the recent things I've been posting, quality wise that is. 

In this scenario I have made up the four models are basically going after this young man fresh out of high school. Whether that be at work, at his apartment, or at their house.

I am an adult lookin for adults for a story that is purely fantasy.  
     
    
I am going to try to set the scene first, if you just want to see the idea for the prompt skip to the end. 
  

A couple moved in next door to me a few weeks ago. I’m staying in my parents friends house, they decided to move overseas for a sabbatical year, and had generously offered me their home, on condition I looked after it. They were both professors at the college I was going to, do it worked out. They got someone to watch the house, and I got to live privately right off campus.  

Back to the couple. He looked to be around 55. A handsome gentleman, looked like he worked in banking, power suit and a silver head of hair. She, on the other hand, looked to be around 40. [Blonde, with a perfect hourglass figure](https://i.redd.it/inp78euigbcz.jpg), she was the type of woman any young man would give their left hand to have as a neighbor. I say left hand, because they would want the right hand if you know what I mean. 


I didn’t have much to do with them the first week, beyond going over to welcome them and introduce myself. The husband seemed nice enough, if not a little preoccupied, and the wife was very bubbly and sweet. I did notice that she was in fantastic shape for her age, but I did catch a glimpse of a private gym in the house so that accounted for her body. 

I left them my number with the offer to call if they needed anything, and I didn’t hear from them for two weeks. One morning, on a Sunday, she called me up to ask me to help set up her wifi. She explained that her husband was at work, being a workaholic, and I was happy to help. That was when I first realized she was a bit dim. The only problem with the WiFi was it was unplugged, but she didn’t seem to understand that. She also had me fix a faucet, which was only not working because she was trying to turn the knob the wrong way. 


Oh, and did I mention [what she was wearing when I got there?](https://i.imgur.com/QITRGrV.jpg). I was happy to help, and quickly did what she needed, before chatting for a few minutes. I didn’t really pay attention, [for obvious reasons](https://i.redd.it/m8m86q5gpfw01.png). But as she droned on, and I eagerly watched and waited for her tits to slip out, I did hear a bit. She mentioned how her husband didn’t let her go to his office anymore, because she would always end up talking to the interns, and once she even let them slap her ass, but just to prove it was real. She explained how at first her husband was upset, but he wasn’t angry after she told him she did it to prove to the interns that their boss had a real wife, not a plastic one. 



After we finished chatting, I went back home, but my mind was filled with ideas. 

**end of scene**


So, if it’s not abundantly clear from the setting, I’m looking for a woman who wants to play a bimbo. Not a cock hungry whore, but rather a really sweet, innocent, and gullible woman. I’ll be the young neighbor who slowly starts to take advantage of her, first in small ways, like convincing her to model her bikinis for me, or even lingerie. But we’ll slowly take it further and further, maybe even involving her husband. Perhaps they are trying to conceive, and I explain that I know the best position to impregnate a woman, but I have to demonstrate it on her. 

I think you get it. My kinks are bimbos, big tits, outfits, naive women, oily sex, public sex, exhibition, anal, eating pussy/ass, cheating, cuckolding, and much much more. I can’t wait for some envelopes.

8mx40m,1,2018-05-29,I'm broke and wrecked the car I was borrowing. I can't get to work. Should I find a new job or buy a car?,heyronald,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8mx40m/im_broke_and_wrecked_the_car_i_was_borrowing_i/,"I'm in the US, 20, and starting my last year of college in the fall. I started an internship 4 months ago, 45 miles from where I go to school and had an hour commute by highway.

I started out working 20 hours/week so I could attend classes as a full-time student, living in the dorm, and then started working full-time a couple weeks ago when the semester ended.

I've been borrowing a friend's old car but I was in accident last week when a truck pulled out of the shoulder in front of me on the highway and I totalled the car swerving out of the way. My friend is handling the insurance and the other driver's insurance should cover the cost of the car, but I don't think I'll be getting anything. My friend doesn't expect me to pay them back for the car, thankfully.

Unfortunately, now I don't have any way to get to work. There's no public transportation where I live and I can't find anyone to carpool with. I was only making $10/hr and, due to living costs, haven't managed to save any of it.

The job experience in my field and the likelihood of getting a job there right out of college seemed worth breaking even to me, but if I can't continue working there the rest of the summer or part-time in the fall, they'll probably find someone else to fill my position.

I've only got about $500 in the bank after next month's rent and I have bad credit due to accidently charging an online order to a credit card and not noticing for a month over a year ago. I've also got about 20k in student loans. My parents are unable to help.

I have no idea what to do. Can I afford a used car and insurance without going too much further into debt? Should I give up the internship and find a job I can ride my bike to? I'd really like to continue the internship because I was learning a lot and my co-workers really appreciated having me there.

Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR: I wrecked my friend's car and have no way to get to my internship. I'd like to keep working there but don't know whether I should buy a car since I'm broke and have bad credit."

We knew e/o for about 2-3 years before getting together, lasted for exactly 6 months before she decided that a LDR (went to China for a short internship programme) was taking too much of a toll on her.


After breaking up, she assured me that we would still be close friends as her family loves me and has said that they would still want me to visit every now and then. I have loads of stuff that are ""loaned"" to her like jackets, caps and other stuff that we have both agreed will be returned to me after I'm done with my internship. Here lies the problem....

After breaking up, I stopped initiating the conversations as firstly, it was always me in the relationship who started the convos. Secondly, I was still in shock then as she only decided within 2 days that we should break up. She has also assured me that she would not be taking down the posts she has made on social media platforms that were dedicated to me as ""I was a boyfriend that she never regretted meeting"" and that ""Those were cherished memories"". 


After I have stopped initiating, she stopped messaging as well. She unfollowed me on my private IG account where I still continued to ""show"" I was completely ""fine"" and having a normal time. She has also blocked me from her private, fb and most forms of communications. Most importantly, she has removed all the posts dedicated to me which she has solemnly sworn and promised not to take down.


I am extremely hurt and am unable to bring myself to trust her if I were to meet her/befriend her as she has betrayed my trust twice already. I adore her family and would want to keep in contact with them but how awkward would it be if I were to just visit her house just to talk to her parents &amp; siblings yet not be comfortable talking to her.


**Tldr**: Ex betrayed my trust again, don't know how to cope. Should I still be friends with her? or cut her out of my life completely?

8my2r1,1,2018-05-29,Will there be any huge damages to my credit if I use one of those 0% APR on all purchases credit cards for limited time?,JoshRawrrs1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8my2r1/will_there_be_any_huge_damages_to_my_credit_if_i/,"So I got approved for the Bank of America Rewards master card, and because I had a huge bank history with them (6+ years, since I could open a checkings account with my parents help, I'm 22 now).

Before I would earn enough and make sure I have leg room before I spend my money on things I need. But I got too lucky getting classes for Fall Semester that I wanted to pay the classes before anything happen to them. (I once forgot about the classes and actually got dropped for non payment in the past).

I put about $800 on my credit card because my classes cost about $780~ and I bought something else.

Now, my bank and 3 customer service reps had let me know that my 0% APR on all purchases is good for one year. So by April of 2019, I don't get any interest if I at least made the minimum payment which is $25.

Besides that clause, will there be any other big detriments to not paying the debt off within lets say 6months? Besides credit score dropping.

I'm not going to take 6months to pay it off. I make about $1900 through my internship right now per month, so I probably could pay it off by the next 2 months.

Thank you!"
8my3i4,251,2018-05-29,Feminist Manager at Work,TofuandBiscuits,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/8my3i4/feminist_manager_at_work/,"Today one of the managers in my office is an extremely vocal feminist had giant freakout. This woman is typical of the middle aged feminist in middle management. Their technological competency is flawed, their attitude is terrible and for the most part they succeed in aggravating everyone around them. Yet because they've been able to jump from workplace to workplace, companies hire them for their ""extensive experience.""

Today was my turn to get blamed for something by her. I was called into the big boss's office under the accusation that I had deliberately avoided work she had assigned to me and sabotaged one of the projects she was working on. Her work laptop was there, showcasing the email correspondence between us in which I'd claimed the work was done.

""He just sent me back the work file untouched. He's a damned liar."" She proclaimed with a mixture of anger and glee to the boss.

The big boss scanned the email carefully before glancing at me and back to her again. Opening the attachment, he passed the laptop back to me and asked to see the work I'd done.

I open the file and move the mouse cursor to the bottom of the database sheet towards the tab section. Wallah! Twelve separate tabs detailing our client's specifications and requests segregated exactly how the big boss had mentioned to me when this assignment was issued. 

Her triumphant facade transforms into one of absolute shock. The boss thanks me for clearing things up and I'm permitted to get back to my desk.

I got an apology email later from my boss informing me that the manager has been temporarily relieved of assignment as an assessment of her core competencies will be carried out by a board in the upper management. Apparently, the rumours that she didn't even know how to use our database or cloud system at all and had been sending word and excel documents to her interns to log into our company's programs might have been true after all.

I don't excuse the incompetencies of women but I almost feel like it's second nature to be automatically prepared for it after understanding female nature. It's one of the changes MGTOW philosophy has made in my life that's been overwhelmingly positive. 

Now I just automatically assume if a woman is involved somehow, she'll fuck something up so cover your bases and have a contingency plan."
8mygsb,26,2018-05-29,Mote Ifrit,Justsoneguy,FFRecordKeeper,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/8mygsb/mote_ifrit/,"TL;DR: Picking Seifer brought me down the memory lane of Mote Ifrit.   

Warning: Wall of text; sorry!    

So, as I was running Sundaily for leveling magicite, I had all characters at max level, including core! Except for 5 MCIII's that were sitting in the hall of rites. I didn't have any character remaining even with a Unique SB to their name that wasn't triple broken. I decided to randomly pick one and by chance SEIFER was my choice. Took his lode, broke his cap, then went to the party screen and picked him up into my line-up. And he defaulted to the BACK row...    

In case you did not notice it before, whenever you pick a character for the first time into your line-up, they default to the FRONT row, even if they were a mage or a healer. Unless you move them to the back row and then remove them from your team only then will they deafult to the back row when picking them again.   

It was a small detail but it took me by surprise; as I said I didn't have any SB's for Seifer and thus I never had him in any FF8 teams for cid missions or otherwise. The SB's I had for FF8 never justified picking Seifer, and I never recall choosing him for anything. nevertheless, having him default to the BACK row meant that I MUST have used him before and in the BACK row no less.   

I thought long and hard trying to remember, and then the memory hit me like Doomtrain with all of the associated Status Aliments! Brought upon by the dredged up recollection of the utter misery that I inexplicably was reliving again, I felt hot sweat pouring from my head, my hands trembled, my pulse spiked, my breath quickened, my throat dried up and my knees shook.   

I remembered: I used Seifer before...    

... for MOTE IFIRIT.     

Now I am not a day 1 player, but I have played long enough to recognize that I might be a fossil, too old to be considered a veteran for some keepers, and thus not many here in the sub now know about Mote Ifirit.   

Gather around lads and lassies, for a dinosaur is about to share with you a brief story.    

You see, in the land before time, we didn't have farmable Mote dungeons, or magicites or torments. We had Mote Ifirit. Before he arrived, we heard frightened whispers from the east to be prepared.   

*Pauses to take two puffs from his pipes and blows smoke*.   

We thought we were.    

*Pauses to take another two puffs, dozes off a bit, wakes up again by the smoke chocking him and resumes*.   

We thought we were...but we thought wrong.   

It was a masacre. Fiery rivers of raging blood overflew by the mad carnage as one brave keeper after another threw themselves at him, the demon, the destroyer, the despicable: Ifrit.    

We tried, by Enlil's grey beard, we tried. Strategies went like this: use the shared medica relics, have Seifer in the back row with draw attack, use Rinoa's BSB 1 on two mages for DPS. Fight, fight, fight God damn him, FIGHT!    

We were losing hope, he was culling our numbers, tormenting us by his fake smile as he hurled meteors from the heavens for it seemed even higher beings were taking his side too. Was it cruelty or fear, no one knew why even the gods were supporting his mad tyrannical rage...until it happened.   

A kerfuffle! Courtesy of an intern!    

A bonus reward, an additional gift! It was a 5 star mote!!!    

What that you say?! 5 star motes did not exist at the time?!!    

...    

Ah! Yes, yes, I remember now: It was a SINGLE BARD MOTE!!!!    

What? WHAT?! Those were not there also?!!!!    


...    

It was something ALL RIGHT!    


Anyway, it was something, an additional reward if the Cid Mission is completed. And all of us keepers, we became like demons possessed! The RW list was full of Rinoas, the sub was flooded with strategies with poverty set-ups and the like.    

It was like nothing I have seen before... or since...    

In the end, we prevailed! WE PREVAILED LADS AND LASSIES!!!    

Yours truly was one of the few who also did it! The sweat and blood and tears my brothers and sisters and I have paid were not in vain; we slayed the beast like Sephiroth slayed Aerith *SPOILER ALERT!* oh wait, that was supposed to be said befo...    

*Zzz...Zzz...Zzz*.   

For real: If you have read till this point, thanks for reading; I just felt like sharing an unexpected recollection brought by Seifer!    

Edit: HIS NAME IS SEEEEEEIFER!!! And grammer too!"
8myyu2,1,2018-05-29,M4Futa - the Futa Apocalypse,weakthrow,futarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/futarp/comments/8myyu2/m4futa_the_futa_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you.

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of girls on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the girls, with the driver sitting on her lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the man down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The man in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the girls in the crowd moving now the foot long cock pounding in and out of the driver's mouth.

Jesus christ, the entire circle of them have them - monster cocks are being pulled out from beneath skirts, too tight jeans and yoga pants

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at that point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

Even as he talks the female anchor blushes and licks her lips, one hand slowly moving below the table as she turns to look at her partner

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from both of us being young to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/daughter, mother/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Everyone - Every woman in the world now has a footlong cock, the strength of a linebacker and the libido of a fratboy? uh-oh

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks  - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the futa apocalypse, not the futa group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

Other kinks! https://m.imgur.com/MTINyO2"

I've just been so lucky to have these opportunities fall on my lap...

On the other hand, my parents don't bother working. Instead they're foster parents who milk the system for all they can from stipends that are supposed to be for the kids. They use it for living expenses. And their excuse is that they're not lucky enough to find jobs... They don't even find anything wrong with what they're doing. I'm gonna go no contact soon cause their passive aggressive belittling of my accomplishments are really getting to me. I don't know why I want acknowledgement from them, but it's not gonna happen. "
8mzlmk,4,2018-05-29,2007 Mazda3 Sport Touring?,prettysammy007,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/8mzlmk/2007_mazda3_sport_touring/,"Hi all,

Current EE student/intern in the Portland, OR area. My intern bucks are burning a hole in my pocket and I'm looking at buying a used car for $6k or lower.

I currently have my eye on the car indicated in the title. It's an automatic with 152k miles and the seller wants $5200 for it. I've test driven it; works fantastic. Transmission fluid looks/smells fine (apparently that's an issue with the AT Mazdas around that model year?). 

Thought I'd come here for advice before dropping a lot of money. Should I buy it? What should I look out for if I do? Are there other options out there that may better suit my needs I should look into?

FWIW, I'm currently in a '97 Subaru Legacy Outback that has quite a few issues (lack of power being one of them). Thanks in advance."
8mzmtb,30,2018-05-29,My parents never let me fail financially and I'm not sure if I'm being greedy or they are generous,secondnameIA,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/8mzmtb/my_parents_never_let_me_fail_financially_and_im/,"I am 35 with a few kids.  My parents never spoiled me growing up and they always made me have a job. They never bought me a car, never paid for a cell phone, etc., so it's not that type of situation. They never let me fail because even when I've made bad decisions they've came to my rescue without directly saying that.  

When I was in high school I got arrested.  Instead of going to jail they paid for a diversion program that ended up expunging my record.  As of today I don't have a criminal record because of it.

When I was in college I bought a foreclosed house sight unseen to flip because I thought I could make easy money.  I broke into the house one night and saw mold growing all over the basement.  In order to get out of the contract I had to spend $2,500.  My dad gave me that money to make sure I didn't get in over my head.

Also in college I got an unpaid internship.  Many of my peers were getting paid for their internships and I didn't think it through; that getting an unpaid internship would mean no money for rent or gas.  When I told my dad this he decided to pay my rent and send me gas money for the duration of the internship.

When my wife and I bought our first house I overpaid because it was the housing bubble.  My dad ended up giving me $30,000 to get the mortgage down to a price we could afford and still save/spend money.  We could have afforded the higher payments but he wanted to make sure we could use that extra money to save instead of going house poor.

When we had kids I was complaining about setting up a 529 college savings plan for them.  My dad ended up sending us a check for $15,000 so that saving for college wouldn't disrupt our other savings goals.  Because of that I basically got $15,000 to spend on other things.

Because I didn't learn my lesson the first time I bought another house to flip.  I had about $20,000 down and the house needed some plumbing work.  I was telling my dad and he wrote me a $5,000 check to make sure ""he could help us out"". I could have paid for it but instead I kept the $5,000 I would've spent in my stock account.

I'm conflicted because I don't know if his actions are the result of being financially secure or to bail me out of bad situations.  I can afford all of the things I described but he didn't think I should have to spend my money on them so he gave me money.  I tell him I always appreciate it but never expect it. It's funny because if I need a new car he'll scold me for bad financial decisions, or if I want to buy a new tool for my workshop he'll suggest buying used if i ""really decide you need it""..  I never quite understand his angle.

A friend once asked why I go to my dad for advice and ""approval"" and that as a ""grown\-ass man"" I don't need his approval.  The thing is deep down I'm afraid that not involving him in my life may end this financial help that comes sporadically. "

&amp;nbsp;    
1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hierbij zend ik u het antwoord op de vragen van het lid Van der Molen &amp;#40;CDA&amp;#41; van uw Kamer inzake het verkopen van tv-series aan video-on-demandbedrijven door de publieke omroep.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De vragen werden mij toegezonden bij uw bovenaangehaalde brief met kenmerk 2018Z08369.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De minister voor Bijzonder en Voortgezet Onderwijs en Media,

&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden op de schriftelijke vragen van het lid Van der Molen &amp;#40;CDA&amp;#41; van de Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal inzake het verkopen van tv-series aan video-on-demandbedrijven door de publieke omroep &amp;#40;ingezonden d.d. 4 mei 2018&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
1           
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het bericht ‘Publieke omroep verkoopt tv-series aan streaming-diensten’? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2           
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven wat de experimenten inhouden waarbij de NPO tv-series en documentaires gaat aanbieden aan video-on-demandbedrijven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De NPO staat toe dat omroepen voor een beperkt aantal oudere titels - maximaal vijf gelijktijdig per dienst - voor beperkte tijd een non-exclusieve licentie verlenen aan video-on-demanddiensten. Licenties lopen tot uiterlijk 1 januari 2020.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven welke overeenkomsten met KPN, Videoland en Netflix zijn gesloten en of nog meer overeenkomsten gaan volgen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het betreft op dit moment overeenkomsten tussen vijf omroepen, te weten BNNVARA, KRO-NCRV, AVROTROS, EO en VPRO, en KPN, Videoland en Netflix. Of er hierna nog overeenkomsten volgen, hangt volgens de NPO af van de ervaringen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4           
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke mogelijkheden ziet u in het licht van het dienstbaarheidsverbod, zoals opgenomen in artikel 2.141 van de Mediawet 2008?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het ter beschikking stellen van programma’s die in het kader van de publieke taak zijn gemaakt en uitgezonden betreft de exploitatie van rechten. Dat is een nevenactiviteit die valt binnen het kader van het gezamenlijke rechtenbeleid dat onder coördinatie van de NPO wordt gevormd en uitgevoerd. Hiervoor is een rechtenentiteit opgericht. De raad van bestuur van de NPO toetst vooraf of de exploitatie van media-aanbod mogelijk strijdig is met het gemeenschappelijke belang van de landelijke publieke omroep. De raad van bestuur doet dat aan de hand van de eigen Beleidslijn Nevenactiviteiten NPO 2012.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast is het denkbaar dat publieke omroepen buiten de publieke taak om programma’s voor derden gaan produceren. Ook dat is een nevenactiviteit.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Alle nevenactiviteiten behoeven op grond van de Mediawet 2008 voorafgaande goedkeuring van het Commissariaat voor de Media. Het Commissariaat toetst of een nevenactiviteit verband houdt met of ten dienste staat van de publieke mediaopdracht, gerelateerd is aan het media-aanbod , op marktconforme wijze wordt verricht en ten minste kostendekkend is. Het Commissariaat hanteert daarvoor de Beleidsregel Nevenactiviteiten 2016. Bij besluit van 13 juni 2017 heeft het Commissariaat toestemming verleend voor het oprichten van de rechtenentiteit en de exploitatie van onverkort media-aanbod buiten de publieke mediaopdracht. Behalve de specifieke nevenactiviteiten-toets geldt ook het dienstbaarheidsverbod onverkort. Dat verbod ziet op alle activiteiten van een publieke omroep, dus zowel op de hoofdtaak als op de nevenactiviteiten. Ook bij nevenactiviteiten geldt dat op grond van het dienstbaarheidsverbod omroepen normaal economisch dienen te handelen en zich niet dienstbaar mogen opstellen voor de commerciële belangen van derden. Ook hier houdt het Commissariaat toezicht op.   
&amp;nbsp;    
5           
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is de reden dat wordt gestart met deze experimenten, waarbij ervan wordt afgeweken om alle programma's exclusief op de eigen platforms aan te bieden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Exploitatie van rechten is als mogelijke optie genoemd in het kader van het vergroten van de eigen inkomsten van de publieke omroep, zowel in het BCG-onderzoek van 2013 als het recente onderzoek van EY van 17 november 2017.  Volgens de NPO wordt beoogd te onderzoeken welke gevolgen licentieverlening heeft voor de hoofdtaak en wat de financiële waarde van oudere programma’s is. Op basis daarvan wil de NPO beoordelen in welke mate licentieverlening doelmatig is en voldoet aan de inschattingen in de genoemde onderzoeken.   
&amp;nbsp;    
6           
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke gevolgen verwacht u dat deze ontwikkeling heeft voor de eigen platforms van de NPO en de platforms van de Nederlandse commerciële zenders?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Dat kan ik niet beoordelen. In elk geval zal de uitvoering van de hoofdtaak van de publieke omroep er niet onder mogen lijden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
7           
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven op welke manier u betrokken bent bij deze ontwikkeling en wat u van deze ontwikkeling vindt ?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik heb de NPO gevraagd om te kijken welke mogelijkheden voor inkomstenvergroting benut kunnen worden. Exploitatie van rechten is één van de mogelijkheden. De NPO maakt echter zelf de keuzes. Het is daarbij de verantwoordelijkheid van de NPO en omroepen om rekening te houden met de publieke taak en de geldende wet- en regelgeving.   
&amp;nbsp;    
8           
&amp;nbsp;    
Hebben de experimenten een relatie met het Europese concept-wetvoorstel waarbij minstens 30% van het videoaanbod van bijvoorbeeld Netflix en Amazon Prime moet bestaan uit Europese series of films? Zo ja, welke?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee, er is geen relatie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
9           
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat BNNVARA niet alleen exclusieve series voor zichzelf wil gaan produceren, maar ook voor diensten als Netflix en Amazon Prime? Zo ja, wat vindt u hiervan? 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
BNNVARA heeft het voornemen om de productie van dramaseries te reorganiseren door het vormen van een intern productiehuis. Uit het bericht begrijp ik dat dit vooralsnog gericht is op de productie voor de eigen omroep en de publieke taak en dat exclusieve productie voor derden nu niet aan de orde is. Mocht BNNVARA op enig moment willen produceren voor derden, dan verwacht ik dat dat gebeurt binnen de kaders van de wet met toetsing en toezicht door het Commissariaat.

8n0f43,1,2018-05-29,Me (23F) in kind off a personal (mini) crisis after my brother's (27) wedding and doubting all my decisions in life because of it.,ellamaria2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8n0f43/me_23f_in_kind_off_a_personal_mini_crisis_after/,"It's gonna be a long one! So, little background story. I am in a relationship of 5 years with an amazing man (28). He does everything for me, really everything! I was 18 when we started dating and he was my first in everything. When I was 21, we moved in together while I was still studying. We ran our household together while I was studying and doing an internship. In august next year, we are getting married. That's it for the relationship part. 

Other part is my relationship with my family. I have three brothers and two amazing parents! One of my  brothers got married two weeks ago. The two nights before the marriage, we stayed at my parent's house like old times. Since then, I have a nostalgic feeling to times where it used to be just us as a family. 

Of course I had to return to real life and it has been very hard on me. I work as a family counselor and give parents educational advice. Next to that I do a therapist education (1st year of 4) which has also been challenging (exams on friday also yay). 
At random moments I get overwhelmed by my emotions and start crying. All I really want to do at those moments, is return to the safe haven at my parent's house (who live but 20 minutes from my place)... which I know isn't a grown up thing to do. I feel like I moved out too soon and want to make up for that now... 

Of course I love my partner with every part of my body, but this situation of missing the old days makes me doubt everything. Is this the life I want?  Getting married at such young age? With this (sometimes very hard) job and so many responsibilities? I think that last thing is the main problem... All these responsibilities and I just want to run away from them, back to my childhood (aka my parent's house). And I communicated about all this with my partner, he knows all my concerns!

Any people who recognize this? Advices? Already thinking about seeing a therapist about it, but wanted to vent somewhere. 

TL;DR! Marriage of older brother makes me feel nostalgic about my childhood and want to go back to my parents aka run away from all the responsibilities I have at this moment (own marriage, counselling job, therapist education
...)

8n0nvy,2,2018-05-29,My friend [21/F] invited me [21/F] to sleep at her house one night during my road trip. I don't know whaat to do.,its_inspired_us,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8n0nvy/my_friend_21f_invited_me_21f_to_sleep_at_her/,"To preface, throughout my last three years of college I formed a close friendship with two girls. Together we were mutual best friends, and while we had other friends, all three of us spent most of our time together. One friend, Macy, is in nursing school and has 3 semesters to go. The other friend, Karen, has two semesters to go. They both live together.

I was one year ahead of them in school, and half a year ago I moved a few states away to pursue an internship that turned into a job. Because of that, our relationship definitely isn't quite the same and I've become more distanced from them since we aren't able to see each other ever. I might call them once a month, but typically I initiate that, and we text occasionally. They also sat through my excruciating 3 hour graduation ceremony a month ago, even though I couldn't even stay and hang out with them afterwards because of my family. Essentially, we still care about each other, but we're definitely not as close.

Now, onto the problem. I'm taking a long road trip to attend a friends wedding and just travel around in the area. I've camperized my car so I'll be staying there or camping most nights, except for the wedding. The city where my friends live is a halfway point to the wedding too. I was originally hoping I could stay the night with Karen, but she's out of town on an internship. Macy offered to let me stay the night with her, but to be honest, I'm very reluctant to do that for some admittedly shallow reasons.

Macy's house is really really small and I always feel like I'm super intrusive there. I also think it's a bit awkward for me to stay the night 10 feet away from her parents as an adult. They all share the same shower, and Macy has a dog that sleeps with her too. To be frank, there's not any room for me there and I know I wouldn't be able to sleep well, if at all.

I could afford a hotel room, but I'd rather not pay 100 bucks for 8 hours of sleep and to take a shower. The other choice would be to pull into a rest area and sleep, but I'm not sure of the area and how safe that one is. The Walmarts in the city don't allow RVs to spend the night, so I'm guessing the same applies for cars. I could also get into town, hang out with her for a few hours and get dinner together, then keep driving. And not tell my own mom, who would really panic knowing I'm driving through the night.

So my choices are:

Suck it up and spend the night there, even though I'll find it pretty uncomfortable and awkward

Hang out with her for an hour or two then sleep in my (camperized) car somewhere

Hang out with her for a few hours, grab dinner, etc then keep driving



One of the reasons I'm hesitating before saying no is that I feel it would be good for our friendship, in a sense. We could hang out, catch up, make memories, etc. I've definitely been lacking that connection the past half year since I relocated to a new city and haven't had any time to start building friendships. Essentially, right now I'm a total loner who spends most of their time at home because I'm waiting to get an apartment and move out of my parents before I start going to meetups and whatnot actively trying to make friends. I drifted apart from all my friends since high school, and I don't want the same thing to happen with these friends.

Advice? Help me make a decision? Even pro/con lists are welcome.

**Tl;dr: My friend invited me to stay the night during a road trip. I really don't want to, but the other options are't that desirable. Also, our friendship has suffered with distance so any advice on that would be neat too.**"

8n1et3,1,2018-05-29,Confused about my best friend [16/M] and I [17/F]’s bond,filler_text,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8n1et3/confused_about_my_best_friend_16m_and_i_17fs_bond/,"Good afternoon reddit! Hope y’all are having a spectacular day so far! 
Some background: my current best friend and I shared a wonderful 4 month relationship which was a mutual and natural extension our previous deep friendship beforehand, but in April, we (me more reluctantly) decided to revert back to being friends due to (I believe) my friend’s mental state. He’s expressed that he attempted suicide in October of 2017 and is now on medication and therapy for MDD. He’s also stated while we were still dating that he always has this feeling that the relationship is “on the verge of going south” or has a high chance of him not giving me what I deserve attention wise or even hurting me; which he’s explicitly stated he’s afraid of doing, all despite my reassurance that it was going very well. He was of the mindset that being in a relationship with him will detriment me in the fact that he thinks he’s going to drag me down with him for lack of a better description, and thinks of himself as an “immature baby” compared to me (which is halfway true but only for the fact that I have been told im more mature than the majority of youth my age—I unfortunately had to grow up quick to help my father with my younger sisters due to my mother’s terminal illness in my late childhood but that's another matter). I knew this walking into the relationship we had and I embraced it; it never became an issue until he had a problem with it and cut romantic ties and I still think he sells himself short. 
The real issue now is the idea that our breakup practically fortified the bond between us after we had a week or so long cool-off period, and it’s as if nothing has happened on that front! The actual night we broke up (April 16th), it was an 8 hour process (yes that’s a lot but it bolsters my point) and by the end of it I could tell that he was still adamant about cutting ties, but was very reluctant (we were both a huge mess of tears by the very end and there was no hostility or bad blood whatsoever). That whole night we had sat together cuddling and hugging as we talked it out until I left to let him decompress and not break my curfew (which we both protested), and earlier that night I had given him his birthday present of a homemade blanket (he is often very cold) which he still keeps on his bed and uses nightly acccording to him. 
His mother even expressed that we as a pair confuse her because we hang out for long periods of time (more than 5 hours) on a regular basis (once to twice weekly) off campus, which allows for even more time together since our schedules have us going to nearby classes and the same lunch block. My father was also confused until I spelled it out for him two weeks ago that we were not technically dating any longer. Further, are still very physically affectionate towards each other in terms of bodily contact, even after our breakup; I made it a point not to kiss him after I left on April for obvious reasons (and I still don’t aside from occasional platonic forehead ones like I do with my girlfriends) but last night when hung out for the 3rd time this Memorial day weekend, we sat together on his bed while we were texting a mutual friend, and he legitimately and willfully spooned me so that I could see what he was typing, even motioning to me and gently but intentionally positioning me to make us both more comfy. Later we sat in several other cuddling-type positions over the course of the next two hours and nearly fell asleep like that until I had to leave to meet my curfew (which again, we both protested). 
Additionally, we are both still virgins but talk to the other as if we are in an at least somewhat sex-positive relationship. To elaborate, when we were driving back from an all day outing to Chicago (we live in SE Wisconsin), he’d been idly talking about how he’s curious as to how his dick measures up against that of our other mutual friends’ or even the national average, even explicitly stating what he believes his actual size and girth is to me as if it was nothing! I have no real clue if this is just guy talk since I do not possess such organs, or if it’s fringe-normal for friend to talk about that kinda thing, but based on my albeit small amount of experience, guys don’t usually talk about their dick like its the weather to a female friend unless they’re dating or ultra close, even if that. On the opposite front, he has made several tangential neutral, or even complimenting comments about my thighs/chest over the last week or two and enjoys hugging them or laying on my chest if his cuddling position allows (which I have no complaints to however because I am comfortable with most of my friends doing that, let alone him who I trust). He even commented that I’m currently attractive and “cute” while we were discussing past relationships that we’ve had. Furthermore, we still compliment the other on litrerally anything and incessantly say that we're proud of each other over seemingly stupid things (for instance he's genuinely proud that I am very good at a particular video game, and I'm very proud that he finally passed his driver's test and recived and internship position for this fall).

I am by no means complaining about my situation so please do not read it as such! I would take him back in a heartbeat should he change his mind, and he makes for a wonderfully loyal, fun and honest best friend/copilot, so there’s no threat of me cutting him off entirely. I thoroughly enjoy the contact as I am a very physical person, I just have never been more confused in my life since he generally is not a hugely physical person from what I know about him and guys in general. I know that its relatively normal for female friends to share contact with each other of this nature (and I do with my female best friend) but this friend is obviously male and I have no idea if the same rule applies. 

I am fully aware that I am 17 and he's 16, and we're both arguably too young to invest this much time and thought into this or go out and ask the Internet for help, but we both value each other immensely and I can safely say that we both don't want to screw up what we have even if we simply remain friends. I respect his decision either way and know I’ll be satisfied with keeping it this way if he so chooses. I’d love nothing more than to be his girlfriend again, but I know that no one sticks around forever and regardless, I want to maximize my positive interactions with him before we go our separate ways for college like we know we’re going to have to do (he’s either going to go Toronto or Phoenix and I’m staying in state). 
I am simply exremely confused as to if he’s hinting that he wants a relationhsip again and is just too scared to ask, or if he sees me as a pseudo-sister or even a FWB or if he's just a close friend with touch/social starvation who isnt afraid to compliment someone. What does it sound like to any of you? What should I make of it? Any outsider advise/opinion based on your own experiences would be a godsend since I have none to go off of. 

I intend to ask him relatively soon if he still thinks he’s immature and not ready for a relationship or if he might consider reinstating that bond, as his mental state has markedly improved and I know he’s much happier than he was prior (he’s even said so explicitly to me and it shows on his face), but I figure outside opinion is a good thing before I do so

I know that’s a lot but any insight would be more than appreciated! Thanks a whole bunch for even reading this far and I hope you have a lovely rest of the week! 

TLDR
17/F dated 16/M for 4 months, broke up, yet still hang out near constantly, still go on trips outside the city for whole days with just them, compliment each other incessantly, cuddle a lot, talk about nsfw stuff about each other together, have zero hostility/negativity regarding the breakup, and have all the qualities of a relationship minus making out, yet aren’t dating--17/F (me) is ultra confused but open to suggestions from the audience

TLDR the TLDR 
17/F and 16/M officially break up but still like each other and act as if we are still dating minus making out—what should I make of it?

### Training
I've been running with some regularity for the last 3 years, in terms of actually getting myself out the door in the morning, but without any real focus.  I'm a very competitive person, so I've just run to enjoy it, and didn't want to ruin it for myself by doing many races.  My runs had also tend to taper off during the summer when it's hot and unpleasant, and last summer I all but stopped running altogether because I had a really terrible commute to my internship, and didn't want to A. Wake up at 3:30 to run before work; or B. Run in the 90°F weather after work.  I think I was barely hitting 10 miles a week.

Starting in February, I decided I would *actually* train for a half marathon.  I had been hitting 30 miles a week for a few months at that point, so I felt fairly comfortable with the distance again after my summer slack-off.  Furthermore, every year since my freshman year of college, I've told myself I would run a half marathon when I came home in May, and then every year the end of the semester would come and I would slack off for a few weeks during finals and feel too unprepared (again, because I'm really competitive).  No doubt, I *could* have still run it and finished based on training leading up to that point, but my time would not have been very good and it probably would have felt crappy.  Knowing I would be graduating in May (aka, last week), February-me wanted to feel like I had accomplished this goal, so it was time to kick my butt in gear.

I used [Hansons Advanced Half Marathon](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1754/7753/files/Advanced_Half_Marathon_-_3.15.pdf?12975293061006073263) plan as a base, because I like the consistency of running pretty much every day and the pattern it follows.  I made a few modifications, notably I didn't alternate long run distances (so once I started running 14 mile long runs, I did that every week); I didn't do recovery runs longer than 5 miles; my speed work I did at HM -10s / mile pace (as opposed to 10k pace) because, for the life of me, I could *not*  get my splits down that low; and the longest run I did was 15 miles.  All in all, training went pretty well, I stayed injury-free, and I only missed 3 quality workouts in 15 weeks.

### Pre-race
I woke up at 5 and had a cup of coffee, 32 oz of water, a piece of toast with peanut butter, and half a banana.  I was concerned about my ability to drive after racing, so my mom offered to drop me off at the race and then come back around the time I anticipated to be done and meet me at the finish line.  I sent her my Strava beacon thing so she could see where I was from the comfort of her bed with a nice cup of coffee.  I had to pick up my chip, since they were out of them when I went to pick up my bib the night before, then I did an easy 1.5 miles around the block a few times and stretched for about 15 minutes.  By the time that was all done, it was about 7:20, so we all started getting lined up.  I didn't want to be in the front and blocking faster people, but it seemed like everyone was hesitant to get to the front.  I decided to get myself to the outside of the upper-middle area so it would be easier to pass people if needed. 

### Race
I started out in typical ""n00b goes too fast"" fashion, although it felt completely fine, I mainly just wanted to get past all of the slower runners and find myself a good place in the pack. Strava said my first mile was 7:26, the next one I managed to settle into a more manageable pace of what Strava said was ~7:45 for the next.  After each mile I kept asking myself ""Can I maintain this for 2 hours?"" because I *really* did not want to blow up halfway through, but I honestly felt like I could keep running at that pace for the rest of my life so I decided to keep on going.

My initial strategy was to try to follow someone going at a decent pace and just focus on keeping with them the whole race.  This was, in part, designed to keep myself on pace, but also largely due to the fact that the course was [pretty convoluted](http://www.usatf.org/events/courses/maps/showMap.asp?courseID=VA14079RT) and I was worried I would get lost. Each time I found a good candidate, I would follow them for about a mile or so before they would either slow down or stop, and then I needed to catch up with the next person.  That made me really grateful that the vast majority of my training took place in ""Hill Country"" in the heart of Texas, seeing as I've become accustomed to insane heat / humidity and massive hills.  I didn't even notice any hills (save for one near the start / finish line), but looking at my Strava activity afterward, it seems that there may have been a few.

The first 6 miles really flew by, and I don't remember much other than the fact that I miserably failed to successfully drink water while running (picture: grabbing cup and throwing water into my face with my mouth open in hopes to get some in), and that I was amazed at still feeling so good while pulling those splits.  That is, until I saw the marker for mile 6 about 30 seconds after Strava said I had made it to mile 6, and I realized the splits I had been seeing were at least 5 seconds faster than my actual splits.  That certainly made me glad that I had decided to not slow myself down to my goal pace of 8:00 min / mile, but I became increasingly worried about what my actual time would end up being.  I decided to stop paying attention to what was on my phone, and just focus for the rest of the race on running at the same intensity that I had been for the previous 6 miles.

The following 5 miles ticked by just as seamlessly as the previous 6.  I kept expecting to hit a wall, or at the very least start to struggle a bit more, but honestly the pain I felt was no where near the level that I had been experiencing in my 7-mile HM pace runs during training (thank you, Hansons, for exposing me to the beauty of cumulative fatigue!).  At the 11 mile marker, I decided to check what time it was, and saw that it was 9:00 exactly so I only had 15 minutes to make it the next 2.1 miles to make my goal time.  I dug in deep, and mustered up as much of a sprint as I could (including up a fairly decent hill) to the finish line.  During the very last stretch (probably 0.3 miles), I was pretty sure I was going to throw up, I saw my mom cheering for me at the finish, and that gave me the strength to push through the last bit. I could barely see the clock, but it looked like it read 1:45:XX and I was determined to make it before that 5 become a 6. I was amazed that, when I crossed, the clock actually read 1:43:XX (apparently the race started a few minutes late)! I was so surprised that I started crying, but I was too dehydrated for there to be tears so I think it turned out as ugly gasping instead.

### Post-race
My mom met me with a bottle of water and we talked some about how the race went.  She said she watched my Strava beacon in terror for the last hour and a half, since I had gone a lot faster than she expected, and she was worried I would have a heart attack.  We waited a bit for official results to come in, but then decided to leave when it was taking longer than anticipated. 

I checked again after I got home, and it turns out I got second in my division, 8th / 161 women, and 33rd out of 345 total.  Not too bad for a first half!

All in all, it was a great experience, and I can't wait to do more races in the fall when it cools down some!

By Will Morrow
29 May 2018

On Thursday, CNN published a lurid and sensationalist article—with very little substance—asserting that 80-year-old actor Morgan Freeman was guilty of inappropriate sexual conduct. Most of the claims came from anonymous sources.

Freeman is known for a screen acting and voiceover career that has spanned almost five decades and includes film roles in Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Se7en (1995), Amistad (1997), Along Came a Spider (2001), Bruce Almighty (2003), Million Dollar Baby (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), Invictus (2009) and Lucy (2014).

The accusations all relate to incidents that allegedly occurred in the last five years, when Freeman was aged between 74 and 79.

Within 12 hours of the CNN report’s publication, the Screen Actors Guild released a cowardly and hypocritical statement declaring that it was “reviewing” Freeman’s lifetime achievement award, bestowed in January. The organization’s spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter that “any accused person has the right to due process, but our starting point is to believe the courageous voices who come forward to report incidents of harassment.” In other words, “due process” begins with assuming that the accused is guilty and proceeding from there.

Also on Friday, Visa, the financial services corporation, suspended advertisements featuring Freeman. Connected to that, the transit authority in Metro Vancouver (British Columbia) announced that it was scrapping a planned promotional campaign that would have had the actor deliver various transit system announcements as part of a Visa ad campaign.

The most significant feature of CNN’s article, which has gone totally “unnoticed” and unchallenged in the media, is the way it was produced. The lead investigator and journalist for the story, Chloe Melas, is herself one of Freeman’s accusers, and the only one who is named!

CNN’s selection of Melas to lead its investigation with editor An Phung indicates that its intention was never to produce an objective account. The plan was to provide a platform for Melas to publicly denounce Freeman in the guise of a “news article,” and combine her own accusation with anonymous statements dragging Freeman through the mud.

Freeman released a statement on Friday afternoon stating, “I admit that I am someone who feels a need to try to make women, and men, feel appreciated and at ease around me. As a part of that, I would often try to joke with and compliment women, in what I thought was a light-hearted and humorous way.

“Clearly I was not always coming across the way I intended. And that is why I apologized Thursday and will continue to apologize to anyone I might have upset, however unintentionally. But I also want to be clear: I did not create unsafe work environments. I did not assault women. I did not offer employment or advancement in exchange for sex. Any suggestion that I did so is completely false.”

Freeman added, “I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday’s media reports.”

While some of the incidents described in the report, if they occurred, involve lewd behavior, none could remotely be described as criminal. A healthy portion of Melas and Phung’s rambling, 4,000-word article consists of examples of Freeman making “inappropriate” comments or “staring,” or being described as “creepy” by former employees.

Melas’ own accusation relates to an interaction at a 2016 press junket for Freeman’s film Going in Style, co-starring Michael Caine and Alan Arkin, which she was covering as a CNN entertainment reporter. Melas, who was six months pregnant at the time, claims that Freeman told her, “You look ripe,” and, “I wish I was there.”

CNN published a video of the latter comment, which occurred in the middle of an interview with Freeman, Arkin and Caine. Based on the video, Freeman’s comment appears to be a response to an anecdote related by Caine about how he had once “congratulated” a woman who turned out not to be pregnant. Melas claims that Freeman made the same comment several times that were not captured on camera.

Remarkably, following the event, Melas began reaching out to others in the industry for stories about Freeman. Melas and Phung note that they spoke to “dozens” of people and that “some praised Freeman, saying they never witnessed any questionable behavior or that he was a consummate professional on set and in the office.” However, none of these people are quoted, and the reference is included only to provide a veneer of objectivity for the piece.

The remainder of the article consists of accusations from eight women who say they were harassed or made to feel uncomfortable by Freeman, and eight others who claim to have witnessed an incident. The sources are entertainment reporters, former staffers and production assistants at Freeman’s company Revelations Entertainment, or individuals who worked in the industry.

A woman identified as a former production assistant on Going in Style stated that in 2015 Freeman touched her lower back, and on another occasion he unsuccessfully tried to lift her skirt. The other allegation involving physical contact was made by an employee who said he saw Freeman massaging the shoulder of an intern.

One former employee is quoted describing Freeman as a “creepy uncle.” Melas and Phung write that in another incident, Freeman asked a woman to “twirl.” Another Revelations Entertainment employee said Freeman would “make vulgar and sexual comments about women” and had once said, referring to a woman, “I’d like to have her for an hour.”

A manager at Revelations told CNN that Freeman would “come over to my desk to say hi and he’d just stand there and stare at me. He would stare at my breasts.” She said that if she passed him he would “stare at me in an awkward way,” and would “look me up and down.” A number of similar accounts are cited.

The New York Times, which was awarded the Pulitzer prize for its role spearheading the sexual misconduct witch-hunt that has seen numerous artistic figures taken down by unsubstantiated allegations, has given its support to the campaign against Freeman, publishing a favorable interview with CNN reporter Chloe Melas on May 26 about the “investigation.”"

8n1mh1,1,2018-05-29,Boyfriend (35 M) wants me (25 F) to go see his friends/family often but I'm introverted yet sometimes feel immense pressure to? Please help.,AmpleCat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8n1mh1/boyfriend_35_m_wants_me_25_f_to_go_see_his/,"So I am living in my boyfriend's town and currently doing a masters in a pretty competitive field so my energy levels after the day's done is medium\-low most of the time. I also have responsibilities in my masters that other students in this stage don't normally have \- like training/supervising interns etc which tends to normally come during pHd in my field. 

My family and majority of friends \(that aren't from work itself\) have moved elsewhere. So when my bf and I visit friends/family, they're 99&amp;#37; of the time \- his. I'm okay with this, and do accompany him about 70&amp;#37; \(if not more.. I'm being modest\) of the time. But sometimes with my heavy work load and introverted personality, I prefer staying home with the cats, watching netflix, wrapped up in a blanket or 2, alone. I've heard that this isn't healthy and people should socialize more but tbh I work around people more than I am alone and I just feel drained after. Perhaps this is something in my personality I need to correct, or I'm too lazy? Anyway my bf is usually understanding when I cancel or decline to go out with his friends time to time \(it doesn't happen often where I decline\) but I can tell a lot of these times he's just putting up a front for me as it shows in his face. Sometimes he'll try to force me to go by jokingly mentioning how much I'm missing out on and sometimes he'll get down right upset. I have this irrational fear that with the way I am, he'll eventually leave/cheat on me with someone more social and less busy than me. Because of this I also feel the pressure to say yes when I want to say no to going out. I struggle with anxiety on top of the introvertedness so saying yes and going out when I don't takes a toll on my mental health which is sub\-par on a good day anyways.

I feel that now is the right time to find an entry level job or internship but everywhere people want you to know Objective C. So I decided to learn this weird language. It took me a week to get familiar with it and then I started looking for up to date iOS 11 books on Objective C but wasn't able to find any...

I have MS. I’m in my early 30’s. I’m a combat veteran and had a thriving career as a corporate mid-level manager, and two years ago I walked away from my career. Now I’m back in school learning a new skill: bioinformatics.
My focus is on MS research through computer data analytics. I’ve got a bioinformatics mentor and a neuro clinic internship, and I’m learning the ins and outs of MS (when I can get myself moving). 
One big thing I’m learning is we don’t have a lot of great informing systems for MS. 
The society does a good job, and there’s countless journals that touch on — or specialize in —  Multiple Sclerosis, but I feel there’s a lot of good info or interesting studies that aren’t broadly accepted or well-known.
I dive deep into this stuff as an investigator (with strong motivation because I have MS), but I’m curious about other people’s personal research. I want to learn how other MS patients approach learning more about their disease. 
So I propose a few questions to you all:  
1. What informing systems do you use to further understand your MS? 
2. How do you decide to trust a particular journal, study, or doctor recommendation? 
3. What do you do keep your doctors in check and advocate for your own health?
4. How do you research your medications?
That should cover it. I’m just curious, really. Thanks for your time. "
8n2d42,2,2018-05-29,Tips for an extension,AHPx,chrome_extensions,https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome_extensions/comments/8n2d42/tips_for_an_extension/,"I just took an unpaid internship to supplement my resume. Trying my hardest to be useful. We sell a marketing service.

I have not done any programming in a number of years, but figure I have enough experience in other languages to know what to Google for and how to piece together a few tutorials to get something that will work. Before wasting even more of my time I was hoping someone could let me know if I'm at least heading down the right track?

Part of our strategy is to contact a company and sign them up for a free trial. We take a current list of their stock at that point.  I do not know how we get this information. We then track how many clicks each item gets through all our advertising avenues. 

At the end of the trial we have end up with a spread sheet with each item listed, and how many clicks it received. To determine if it sold or not, we manually search for the product ID on their website, and mark them off as sold or not sold. There are usually hundreds to thousands of items and it eats up a huge chunk of our time (but mostly my time).

Since the spreadsheet file is already on Google sheets, I thought a chrome extension may be the easiest way to automate the process? but I honestly do not know if they can be referenced. 

My goal is to have the extension pull the stock number from the spreadsheet, enter the stock number into the stock field on their website, and return a value  (1/0) depending on if there is a listing or not, and then add that to a new field on the same row in the original spreadsheet. Repeating until all numbers have been checked.

Any tips or pointers? Will it even work on this platform? think it's a fairly conceptually simple project.

I don't really know where to post this but I know that you guys will have some advice.

So I just finished my first year in college and have a nice internship paying $20/hour. I like college it's nice living on your own and I've got some buddies who I'm living with in a house next year so things are going well in that regard. But somehow I still feel empty inside and as if no one actually cares about me except my family and a couple close friends.

Since high school began I believe I've developed social anxiety. I guess I peaked freshman year because I was friends with so many people and got with a few girls. Then my friend group got smaller and girls weren't into me like that anymore, just as friends. So I kept the real ones close and moved on and didn't really give a fuck about women because they weren't into me.

This was when I started smoking weed and drinking more which has kept my mind off of everything and lets me chill with some homies.  

Fast forward to now, I smoke every day \(nicotine as well for the past year or two\), drink on the weekends, and have experimented with psychs and stims. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't know how to talk to girls in a way that makes them want me, frankly. I know I'm not gay and it's been a while since I've actually made a connection with another girl. So reddit, please give some advice on how to be a better person!"

Okay, so the big one is if this will turn out allright.  I feel more positive, but Ishida being Ishida means that this may not be the case.  Usually, when I think one thing TG does the opposite.  For example, Amon will lose to Don and go berserk.  Instead, Amon defeats Don etc.  

As of right now I have some thoughts

1.  Ken blew off both of Furuta's arms and legs most likely that last page. However, we don't know anything about being a nucleus. Most importantly if Ken defeats/kills Furuta then he is the only one beyond Kimi that might know how to stop it and dying could be part of Furuta's plan.  Here's what I do know. Kanou needs to die to make Kimi available with interns.  This suggests that this is an exact opposite move of what Kanou wants, which is breaking the bird cage. 
2.  Stopping the spores, affects Ken's kid.  If the permanent lifespan is taken away, Ken's kid goes half ghoul and then dies at age 30, leaving Ken if he survives, watch his kid die from the spores UNLESS something happens soon that prevents this from happening.  Then again Ken wins the lottery and the kid is a biological OEK
3. V is still at large with Kaiko and they may rush to Furuta's aid. If they do, then that puts shade on Hide and Kimi. (Something might be going on with the whistle and Hide finger point on cheek.  
4.  People are still getting zombiefied.  Dragon Rize is still at large.  Some are saying that Furuta got hit by Dragon Rize that last page.
5.  If anything, Furuta's  narration before dragon and during the fight suggest he might live. Unless, he was narrating in the present at the scene awhile back, when he was describing himself leaving the building, and being present during the oggai squad. 
6.  Ken's TG Re 143 narration suggests he's talking from the future.  That doesn't bode well and if he narrates again than it means we are going the tragedy route.  In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if we get a flash forward only to see heavy casualties and events missing from the present to explain it soon.  
7.  Ken is still trying to protect everyone. The universe is saying that he can't in the past and this time Ken is relying on others to do their fights not rushing to everyone's aid. I mean could you imagine Ken winning the fight, saving the world, and then going back to see a large swathe of the cast killed off screen that would be pretty dark. 
8.  Everything points to a bittersweet ending with resolution, but it may not mean anything if Ishida goes tragedy.  

Really, I still think that this really comes down to Hide, Ken, and Rize.

8n324v,0,2018-05-29,Just want to post a warning to any homeowners out there in the US,DoubleStuffedCheezIt,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/8n324v/just_want_to_post_a_warning_to_any_homeowners_out/,"*TL;DR: If someone knocks on your door and wants to use your home as an ""advertising home"" and they'll install a security system for free, it isn't a scam but just read the contract you sign, if you end up taking the offer, carefully.*

Ok, so I've been mulling over posting this for awhile because I have been trying to figure out how to post this without violating my, now former employer's, contract with me.

*Back story:* So I am college student and was looking for an internship this summer, I had a few options but was not hearing back from the hiring managers and the end of the semester was fast approaching. So my friend hits me up and asks what I was doing over the summer and if I might be interested in an internship in a certain city in the US. I say sure since it doesn't hurt to options and end up taking the position because of how much they said their average intern makes over the summer (it's a commission based sales position). There were lots of verbal promises made, but I made the mistake of not getting them in writing. Promises included: a daily per diem and cash reimbursement for my travels to the location, both of which were not included in the contact I signed.

*Main story:* So basically this company sells home security systems, much like ADT. I will not name them, to just try to protect myself, but they are known for giving free systems and installations in addition to having smart home upgrades like doorbell cameras, thermostats, cameras, etc. Anyways, their main method of gaining new customers is by going to lots of cities all over the country between May and September, hiring college kids, and then doing door to door sales, which I don't think is the smartest method of trying to get business. However from what I've experienced, they aren't concerned with that because it's all a numbers game to upper management.

*Where the problem lies:* So when I was being trained, I learned quite a bit of useful sales practices but was told lots of things that, to me, were a bit on the pushy/used-car salesman style. Some of these things included:

* Not making eye contact unless you ask someone a direct question as that lower the chance of you being interrupted 

* Not asking to enter a home, but just making a statement, like ""lets go look at that"" instead of ""can I come inside to take a look at that?""

* Flat out making up stuff like saying you're an employee in the marketing department rather than saying you're a commission based sales rep.

I didn't agree with most of what they wanted me to do but I felt like they had a really good product so I tried to make sales by focusing on how we could help them with our service and make sure they got exactly what they needed and not pad my commission by up-selling. I knew it would be harder trying to do door-to-door sales by being upfront but I am not willing to do or say anything just to make a sale.

*Why I left:* Well lots of things I was told, directly by my manager, were only half truths about our services. They offered a lifetime service guarantee that I was told was completely free to the customer if they ever needed anything replaced or fixed with their system. Well, the replacement equipment is free, but there is fee for the technician to come out. Another part of that service plan is that if the customer moves, they just call up the corporate office and let them know they're moving and they will get a new system and their new house. Partially true again, it's only free if they sign up for another contract for monitoring, otherwise they have to buy their new system or will have to rip out the system from their old home to move to their new home.

My main concern arose when I started researching the company on the internet and found lots of complaints online from customers who were upset about things I had mentioned above believing that the sales rep hustled them or misled them into signing the contract. And when I started reading complaints online that were mentioning representatives by name, I realized that even if I sold to a customer with the sole intention of helping them with a new security system, I am putting my reputation on the line because if they have any problem with the service, I'm the only name they have. Being a broke college student, my reputation and brand is the most valuable thing about me. Trying to get a new job with the potential of being judged based on a review of an angry person that named me was just not worth the money I might make by staying at the job.

*What I would recommend:* I really do believe that the equipment is high quality. It's manufactured by an extremely reputable company and the monitoring company is also very well known. However, the contract they will have you sign should be scrutinized with a fine tooth comb. Just make sure you know what you're agreeing to. That's what lots of the complaints online were about, people getting rushed into a decision and not reading what they were agreeing to.

*Conclusion:* Its a good product sold that unfortunately is done in a less than upfront way. I'm not here to try to bash this company, I just want to let people know that if they do end up being approached by someone from this company, to not feel pressured into making a rash decision and to throughly understand what you are agreeing to.

Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to condense it as much as I could but there's so much I felt was necessary that it still ended up being a wall of text. I mean, I could probably talk for hours about this. I hope that at least one person finds this useful."

Also could anyone let me know what kind of internships/co-ops ryerson comp eng students have had? My main concern is that there is only an internship program and that there is no co-op option so I would like clarification on that since at this point co-op does seem more appealing to me. If there is a co-op option could someone link some references from the ryerson site?

Also I just checked ouac at it says no under co-op for the offer and says   "" Only permitted when Subject of Major Interest selected is co-op only or has co-op option"" so if somebody could help it would mean a lot

The first era - MAGIC + Derek, Burke, Miranda, Richard, Callie, Addison, Lexie and Mark. I know some of these character weren’t featured in certain seasons, but seasons 1 - 6 is what I’m talking about. This is the show’s prime time, and it had the arguably best cast. The show had a great dynamic of interns, residents and attendings. They were all great together, and created a great cast.

The second era - MAC (Meredith, Alex, Cristina), Teddy, Owen, Callie, Richard, Miranda, Arizona, Mark, Lexie, Jackson, April, Jo, Stephanie, Heather Brooks and Shane Ross. Seasons 7-10. This era features a mix of cast members, and says goodbye to a lot of cast. There was a few short-lived main-cast (Heather Brooks, Shane Ross), and had arguably some very unforgettable seasons. Season 7, Season 8 and Season 9 were mostly boring, unforgettable seasons minus the plane crash and the storm. They were probably my least favourite seasons.

The current/third era - Meredith, Alex, Maggie, Amelia, Jackson, April, Arizona, Callie, Penny, Jo, Stephanie, Nathan Riggs, Richard, Miranda, Ben, Owen and Eliza Minnick. This is the largest main cast of any era. The show can be really good, but also kind of boring. I don’t know how to feel about these later seasons.

I'm in the top 10% of my class, good grades, good  internships, scholarships, but I'm also an addict.
I had weed for the first time about 3 years ago, 1 month into university. For the first few months, I was very cautious about my dosage. I smoked very little and took frequent tolerance breaks. Soon, things got worse with my body. Weed helps with a disease I have, and I started using it more. Things also got somewhat stressful in university and weed helped with that. I started abusing weed.

Since then the longest I've been sober is 60 days, and while my dosage was not crazy large dosages you read on the internet, I've abused weed. I quit for a few weeks before and during important times like job search and exams (like I have to now but I am still not) which allows me to get these relatively high grades and good internships, but I know I'm underperforming in my heart.

I've shown up to work high. I've gotten high at my job.  I basically smoked/vaped medical Kush all day the past 5-6 months. 

Moderation never seems to hold for longer than a few days. Low dosages and high tolerance: maybe that's why weed doesn't harm my performance to a point of disaster. But it's a problem. 

Weed is a really bad habit right now for me. How long of a break should I take from weed so as to rid myself of this habit and clear my head completely? 3 years? 6 months? 2 weeks? I feel so weak every time I cave into my desire of just smoking some more everyday..."

I just discovered this subreddit, but I have so many issues and emotions bottled inside me for a long long time so it is time to spill it all out. I don't know if anyone can help, but if there is someone that can or understands, I thank you in advance.

I chose to study nutrition because I love food and science, I love to help people feel passionate about health through food. I was an international student, playing Division I sport in college. I was always busy with my sport since I started at 14 and competed at the international level. 

Going into college, nutrition was my choice and the department has DPD program, CPD program, nutrition and food management. The only difference between the programs and non-programs is the eligibility of a RD credential at the end. We were supposed to apply for the programs at the end of our sophomore year, and to be considered you need to have at least 250 hours of volunteer work. When I first took freshman nutrition classes my professors did talk about looking for opportunities to volunteer, spend time outside of class learning about nutrition, etc. I did not have a car because I did not know how to drive at that time. Practice was long everyday and I had to travel every weekend for matches with the team. Also, I was just getting used to the college student athlete routine the first year. I probably ubered a few times volunteering at the food bank and that was pretty much it. I applied during my sophomore year and got rejected. They said my volunteer hours and experience level was too low. I was quite upset but it made sense I guess. Almost all of my other classmates got accepted into CPD or DPD except 2 or 3. It was a small cohort, but still I noticed how competitive it was. I wish I could volunteer in the summer but I had to compete for Asian games, Commonwealth games and numerous world cups every year. After getting rejected, I realized I need to get a car asap so I started learning driving and finally got my car around my junior year. Thanks to my Dad who flew over 2 winter breaks to teach me and buy me a car...(although I feel bad because I am so unsuccessful after everything). When I finally got around to volunteer during my time off, I was approaching senior year. It is too late to apply again, according to my advisor. I thought to myself, well I still need the experience anyway, I am going to apply for a Master's coordinated program when I graduate. Experiences... where? As an international student, I was not allowed to work off campus because that is illegal. I even got accepted as an intern for Meals on Wheels and only to get told by my international office advisor that that internship is not a requirement for any of the courses I am taking, so it would be illegal. Internships was out of the question unless it was on campus. So I drove an hour each way to another city to volunteer for a dietitian at a hospital for 2 semesters and she really appreciated my dedication. I told her my situation but there was nothing she could do because I wasn't in the program. During my last semester of school, I got to intern for the Sports Nutrition Dept at my school (on-campus, allowed). Now I have graduated, I only have a BS in Nutrition and no verification statement and nothing for me to get my credentials unless I apply for a Masters CPD program. I am sure getting that requires a ton more experience to even get considered, and my GPA wasn't that impressive. I took pretty much the same classes as my peers that were in the program, but with no supervised practice. My goal is still becoming a RD eventually, but I don't have the funds to go into Masters so I want to work first. Unfortunately I cannot find anything that says that I am qualified to apply. People only hire registered dietitians for everything, from what I have seen. Right now I really don't know how to proceed. I feel so defeated and all the doors are shut, or have been shut all along for me. Should I not give up and keep pursuing, although I don't know how as of now, or change to another field which has more job opportunities? Life is hard, but I didn't know it would be this hard. "

* Assume from now until graduation I've studied CRE extensively, networked a fair bit, and become an expert in excel, argus...whatever software is valuable. Have gained knowledge of the marketplace, etc. From now until I graduate I plan on doing whatever it takes to prepare myself for the job. 

With all of the above, what do yall think? And where can I learn to use excel and argus how someone in the industry would use it? What else should I try to be learning? Thanks in advance

8n4s90,0,2018-05-29,CMV: It's impossible to build a social life or date outside of school/university.,aldjfh,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8n4s90/cmv_its_impossible_to_build_a_social_life_or_date/,"Ive been kicking myself alot lately for having missed opportunities in university and school to make friends and meet women. It seems I fucked up in the best possible scenario where I could have had it all and now it's never ever gonna happen.



Now that I'm currently on an internship which is the first time in my life I'm not in an academic setting, I've seen that literally all I do is wake up, go to the gym, go to work, come home at 5 and before I know it the day is over. I barely ever get to do anything. Its impossible to build any social life. I know some people that have managed to have some social interactions but even they were mainly all from friendships they had from the past while they were in an academic setting.



Currently I don't have any friends I talk to regularly and I honestly don't know where to make any at this point in life. All the meetup groups I go to have different people all the time and I never really have been able to connect with anyone there. They are all so different. As far as dating goes, online dating is almost  completely worthless if you aren't 8/10+ in looks. I didn't have any female friends to begin with so no one is hooking me up that way and cold approaching is just creepy. I get denied entry into clubs for going alone and going to bars alone also creeps people out. But yeah i feel so utterly isolated at this point that even when I tried to do something basic like picking up weed I didnt know how to get it cause I don't know anyone.



So honestly my view based off my experience right now is that I'm up for a very very lonely life ahead of me and alot of people I've talked to online who are in the same situation as mentioned have felt something similar. I feel more and more detached from the mainstream and feel like I will continue to do so as time goes on.

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

**A Memorial Day Monument To Lying**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Donald Trump told a lot of big lies this weekend—even more than usual!**                      
              
**First, Trump [claimed](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1000375761604370434) that Democrats are standing in the way of changing a law** that requires the separation of parents and their children who cross the border seeking asylum from violence in their home countries. This is actually two lies. It is not a law, it is [a new policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/us/trump-immigrant-children-lost.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) devised by the Trump administration. And Democrats [are insisting](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/us/politics/trump-democrats-immigrant-families.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that the Trump administration reverse the policy.                  
          
**Here’s the truth about Trump’s policy:**                  
            
- The administration first [began considering it late last year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/to-curb-illegal-border-crossings-trump-administration-weighs-new-measures-targeting-families/2017/12/21/19300dc2-e66c-11e7-9ec2-518810e7d44d_story.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.a2367d8e1769&amp;noredirect=on).            
              
- White House Chief of Staff John Kelly began talking it up [in March](https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/john-kelly-separating-children-from-parents-immigration-border/?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                    
         
- Earlier this month, Kelly infamously [dismissed concerns](http://www.businessinsider.com/john-kelly-family-separation-policy-illegal-border-crossing-2018-5?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) about the idea by saying, ""the children will be taken care of—put into foster care or whatever.”                     
          
- Trump lashed out at his Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, for initially [resisting the policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/us/politics/trump-homeland-security-secretary-resign.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). She gave in 11 days ago and said, “If you break the law, you go to jail and you're separated from your family. It shouldn't be any different for illegal immigrants.”                 
             
**Second, Trump lied this weekend when he accused the *New York Times* of [fabricating an administration source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-falsely-accuses-the-new-york-times-of-making-up-a-source-it-was-an-official-who-briefed-reporters/2018/05/26/2d055a60-612c-11e8-8c93-8cf33c21da8d_story.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.231c1f12d7fc&amp;noredirect=on)** who cast doubt on the feasibility of holding the U.S./North Korea summit on June 12th. (The source's name is Matt Pottinger and the Times story was based on a sanctioned White House briefing, which basically means Trump told him to say these things, then got mad when the *New York Times* reported it. Stable genius!)                          
            
**Third, Trump continued to promote [a conspiracy theory](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/25/17380212/spygate-trump-russia-spy-stefan-halper-fbi-explained?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) he calls ""Spygate,""** which is about Democrats planting ""spies"" in his campaign. His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani [pointed to this Trump-fabricated conspiracy theory](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1000729767510003712) as evidence that the Russia investigation is illegitimate. (In the actual investigation into Trump, his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is a [key witness](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/us/politics/trump-sessions-obstruction.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) following Trump’s request that Sessions remain in charge of the Russia investigation after he recused himself last year.)                  
                  
**These aren't ""unproven"" or he-said, she-said claims. They are lies.** The lies are meant to make politics on the basis of reason and fact impossible. Being clear about the truth, and about why Trump is lying, is more important than ever.                           
              
**Roseanne is Racist (Who Could Have Known?!)**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Today [ABC canceled its hit reboot of *Roseanne*](http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/29/media/roseanne-twitter-chelsea-clinton/index.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** after Roseanne Barr went on a racist Twitter rant Tuesday morning, in which she called former Obama administration official Valerie Jarrett a child of the “Muslim Brotherhood” and “Planet of the Apes,” and attacked both Chelsea Clinton and George Soros, who we are pretty sure she thinks run the Illuminati.                    
                    
**In a statement, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said ""Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values,”** and Disney CEO Bob Iger echoed that sentiment, saying that cancelling the show was “the right thing to do.” Her agency [ICM quickly dropped her](https://twitter.com/koblin/status/1001539839223848960) afterwards. We’re guessing that the show will be picked up by NRATV tomorrow.                   
             
**This response is the right one, but Barr has promoted racist ideas and conspiracy theories [for years](https://www.buzzfeed.com/marcusjones/roseanne-barr-tweets-that-werent-repugnant-enough-for?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.bsP2LLDJwk#.bsP2LLDJwk).** The decision to reboot her show was bound to blow back on the network. Like Trump, Roseanne’s racist and conspiratorial views aren’t subtle or secret.                          
        
**From Brian:** A common thread connecting the Trump news and the Roseanne news is the role euphemism has played in normalizing both figures. In Roseanne’s case, journalists once again [struggled to describe racism plainly](https://thinkprogress.org/roseanne-barr-racist-tweets-media-euphemisms-2a115bd9d5c9/?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). It’s no different with Trump: Journalists often describe his racist tweets as ""racially charged,"" his baseless conspiracy theories as ""unproven,"" and his lies as ""demonstrable falsehoods."" Important values are under attack in the Trump era, and his critics are rightly upset when institutions don’t defend those values.                                       
               
**What Else**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Missouri Governor [Eric Greitens](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/29/politics/eric-greitens-missouri-governor/index.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) announced that he is resigning, effective this Friday, June 1.** He had stood to face an impeachment inquiry over credible allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as violations of campaign fundraising rules.                   
                 
**Last week, Ireland voted overwhelmingly to [end its extreme policies](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44256152?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) restricting access to abortion.** The U.K., which controls Northern Ireland, is now facing increased pressure to do the same. Meanwhile, the U.S. is regressing. The Supreme Court [declined to hear an appeal](https://twitter.com/GregStohr/status/1001456177509814272) of a circuit court decision that allows an Arkansas law to take effect which restricts access to drugs that induce abortion. That law may now be implemented pending further legal challenges.                  
                  
**A 22-year-old immigrant from Mali is being called “[Spider-Man](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/28/asia/paris-baby-spiderman-rescue-intl/index.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)” after he scaled the side of a building to rescue a child who was suspended from a balcony** in Paris over the weekend. Now, French President Emmanuel Macron says he will be granted citizenship. President Trump is in the process of crafting a tweet calling him a member of MS-13.                       
                
**China has approved [13 new Ivanka Trump trademarks](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/28/china-ivanka-trump-trademarks-610029?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** She is a government official, and her acceptance of private business favors from foreign governments—including the Chinese government, which Trump intends to reward by bailing out the sanctioned company ZTE—is public corruption in plain sight. Or as Maggie Haberman calls it “un-legal friendship money deals.”                  
               
**A new CIA assessment has concluded that North Korea [does not intend to denuclearize](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/cia-report-says-north-korea-won-t-denuclearize-might-open-n878201?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** but may consider opening a “Western hamburger franchise” in Pyongyang, in order to show goodwill.                          
                
**Today Starbucks closed 8,000 locations across the U.S. for [racial bias training](https://work.qz.com/1254860/starbucks-will-close-8000-stores-on-may-29-for-bias-training-after-philadelphia-arrests/?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** reaching nearly 175,000 employees. The trainings come in response to an episode that received national attention last month when the manager of a Starbucks in Philadelphia called the police on two black men who met in a store without purchasing anything.     
                  
**Rep. Tom Garrett (R-VA) announced that he will [not run for re-election](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/rep-garrett-announces-he-is-an-alcoholic-and-will-not-seek-re-election/2018/05/28/40e8839a-62b2-11e8-99d2-0d678ec08c2f_story.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.1b326492b138) this year in order to seek treatment for his alcoholism.** The district leans Republican, according to [*Cook Political Report*](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), though Garrett’s Democratic challenger Leslie Cockburn had raised more money than he had prior to his announcement.

Need Advice.",nicksaiz65,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/8n5jrt/reddit_ive_ruined_my_life_what_do_i_do_now_need/,"So I'm gonna type out the whole story this time. Leaving nothing out. This is gonna be a long one, so strap in for the ride. Haven't even told my family about all of this.

So I'm a Computer Science major. I've jacked up my grades something fierce. My GPA has plummeted, and my transcript is so bad that it's embarrassing. Literally I would never be able to get a job or an internship like this. It's so bad. Ds Fs and Ws as far as the eye can see. Obviously, I lost all scholarship. I could retake all these classes and still come out with a GPA above a 3. But when employers see my transcript I'm sure they'll put my resume in the shredder. I've had to retake classes up to 3 times, and I'm still taking some sophomore level courses in my ""senior"" year. Even if I do graduate, what's the point if I can't even get a freaking job out of school due to my shit tier transcript? I can't even delete it to start over unless I leave school for 4 years.

I had a fantastic first semester, but everything after that was downhill. And I know exactly why too. The first semester I was pretty level and my number one priority was to prove everyone wrong and get amazing grades. Coming into college, I had the mentality that I really hated myself and I had to change myself in whatever way I possibly could. I wanted to be someone else, anyone else. Combine that with 17 hour semesters and a pinch of laziness, I think it really hurt me. I've literally had 2 years of just garbage grades.

I've always been an accomplished violinist and musician though. I'm classically trained and I've reached a very high technical level. What I'm considering doing is changing my major to music and changing schools. I'd have to see if I could get in by audition and practice really hard. I also wouldn't make as much money. But I don't mind living frugally. And plus, my shitty engineering grades would be insignificant. I'd be able to start over as a freshman, and it'd be almost like a blank slate.

So what the hell do I do, Reddit? Do I give Computer Science another try even though my transcript is shit? Do I start over and become a music major somewhere else? What do I do? Help me out here Reddit, I'm lost in life and I have no idea what to do here."
8n5slc,5,2018-05-30,How stoicism helps against hate and conflicts?,lksdshk,Stoicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/8n5slc/how_stoicism_helps_against_hate_and_conflicts/,"I've just read this in Meditations:

""When you face someone’s insults, hatred, whatever . . .
look at his soul. Get inside him. Look at what sort of person
he is. You’ll find you don’t need to strain to impress him.
But  you  do  have  to  wish  him  well.  He’s  your  closest
relative. The gods assist him just as they do you—by signs
and dreams and every other way—to get the things he wants.""

So, I have a story that still annoys me after quite some time. This is an outburst I will use as example...

Summing up: 
I am 24.

I lost my previous job (internship) in a small company over a fight in last October. There was one guy I didnt like him. I kept my distance of that guy, no talking, no greetings...fuck him. It happened a few things before that led to our mutual disaffection. We argued over something I felt harmed, he came into me later to provoke me until I reacted. He threatened to beat me. I stood my ground, of course I couldn't let another man point the finger over my face and not say anything. At the same time my thought was ""remember Stoic!  He is the fucked up one, this will pass and he will suffer the justice. He is crazy but you are not childish as he is, this is ridiculous"".

So those thoughts made me able to hold my anger and not throw the first punch, that would end in a bloody mess. I had never ever dealt with anything like that and didn't know how to deal with it. I told my mannagers what happened in hope he was going to be fired and justice served, it was up to them to solve this, not me, right? Wrong. Fail. The next day they fired me! (He was fired 4 months later when they finally noticed he didn't worth shit there) so I just grabbed my stuff ""fuck this bullshit"" and get the hell of out of there thinking of how stupid they are.

I tried to do the right thing: to forget, to overcome, to let the time heal...but it didn't work...

Suddenly I lost my earnings, my plans...joined the unemployed queue where I still am. That made me so, so angry, it consumed my mind for months.It still do, but lighter. I was thinking of all sort of harms I could do to him. Even dark ideas came across:

""Could I kill him? He deserves to die for what he did to me. I could live with that, my only fear is to get caught and sent to jail but anything else it would make me feel good""

Alright it was nonsense but, like I said, I was really tormented. (The Crime and Punishment fitted well this moral conflict, awesome novel). Anyway that bothered me that even when I was having sex with my girlfriend I was thinking about that, what I should have done...the flashbacks...I felt so bad that I didn't do more than just walk away. He should have suffered...But I didn't do anything.


So after all that I am only relieved now because a friend of mine called me to give the good news he was fired. I am only satisfied now because I wonder if he is struggling to feed his children and how hard his life must be for a non bachelor 35+ years old unemployed man. I know it is wrong to curse people, but I did, and felt ""good"". Deep inside I know I should not feed anger, hate...

At that time I didn't know much about stoicism and barely read my Medidations, only shallow knowledge. But now that I reading and taking notes, I wonder how a stoic would deal with situations like this one. 

How could me, as a stoic, overcome such situation that ended that bad for me?
Yes I am alive, graduating, dating, having a good time...but I was supposed to be doing better things to enrich my carreer and personal goals. Instead I am just here wasting my dear savings while I can't find a job all because of one motherfucker. I am not depressed but I could be happier.

How can I wish him well, or any other shit person on my way?
Marcus Aurelius says a lot about justice, fairness, and how human being are all siblings, even our enemies. He doesn't recognize that there are shit bad people? I could forgive my enemies but they will do the same? Probably not, so it is not fair. Easy for him to say as the most powerful man in the world that could chop off enemies heads as he probably did during the wars.

I am trying to get into stoicism but when it comes another people harming you, I don't see this passive-aggresive attitude having a good effect as I tried in the first moment, but led to more hateful, angry and sad mental state for me.

What can you extract from all this?

What am I missing here?

What do you think about such misfortunes made by people?

Our host contacted us today and said that it is in fact his parents house and not his and that they have arrived back from their (the parents) travels earlier than expected and want the house back.

I'm definitely a couple of months late.

First off, thank you to Ethan and Hila for being awesome and allowing me to do that. Secondly, Dan, Ian, and Moses for being super nice and welcoming to me. Thirdly, sorry for the cringe I was nervous as hell if you couldn't tell. haha

---

***Filler***

I'll try and be brief with the story as a lot of it is just filler. 

My Fiancee and I are avid watchers of all H3 content since I watched ""Grapefruit your man"" after my friend shared a link with me and I shared that beautiful piece of work with her. ***Wink***

We sat there for hours watching video after video and watched the new videos that would come out together from then on. We would reference the memes, the way that we relate to Ethan and Hila ourselves in our personalities... (Ethan being the talkative, outgoing, joking one; Hila being the quiet reserved and artistic one.) I bring this up to give a little insight into what our relationship is like... we like a lot of the stuff the other does, and we love H3.  

---

The story starts the day before the show... I had a date I wanted to propose in mind (3/14 - Pi Day), I had tickets to the H3 show, and a ring and a simple plan. I orginially planned taking her to a restaurant after the show and doing it there... very simple, basic, and easy. 

The weeks prior to the date, I spent a couple of sleepless nights trying to figure out how I was going to pop the question. Thinking, thinking, thinking... Then **BAM** it came to mind. I thought to myself no way Ethan would agree to something like this and I blew it off. This thought process went on for a couple of days and the day before the show, I gathered some courage and emailed Ethan. 

To my surprise, I got a response back in less than 2 hours. He liked the idea and had me speak to Dan. We set up the details and it was a go.

We arrive at the venue and see a line outside the door, and I have no idea what i'm doing, how i'm supposed to separate from her and how i'm supposed to meet up with Dan to go over the plan one final time. I ask her to stand in line and I head to an area where Ian and another member of the crew are setting up a table (I only knew it was Ian at that point because someone screamed ""IAN, Ethan is asking about... blah blah"". I nervously walk up to the enigma, the legend, the soon to be Sharkies Gift Card curser... Ian the Intern, and say ""Hi... Ian? I'm the guy that's gonna propose today..."" 

""HEEEEEYYYY YEAH! OKAY LETS GET YOU SET UP WITH DAN!"" *CALLS MOSES OVER*

LITERAL JESUS GUY WALKS UP... ""What's up?""

Ian: This is the guy that is gonna be proposing today, can you take him with Dan?

JESUSMAN: Ah yes! Come follow me! (very Jesus of him)

*Follow Moses through some doors and into the venue and he opens the door and I hear tune we all know... the H3 intro song playing in the room*

---
I know Ethan and Hila are regular people like you and I but i'd be lying with you if I didn't get the most surreal feeling ever when I looked at them setting their stuff up on the table. I think the feeling is best described by Chris from OneListOneLife, ""[these] are our celebrities..."" we watch their content and hope to one day meet them because they seem like genuinely nice people... Anyways... back to the story...

---

Moses leads me to Dan and Dan welcomes me with a bro hug. Leads me to Ethan and Hila, Ethan and Hila right off the bat are super welcoming and nice. Change of plan, I gotta go on stage and do this. I start sweating buckets. Original plan was to call in, now I gotta go on stage in front of the Naysh... damn. Whatever... gotta do it. 

*""Don't become a meme and you're fine"", I told myself.*

I walk outside, rejoin my girlfriend and the rest is history. 

***Show Ends***

People are crowding the venue stage in hopes of pictures with Ethan, Hila, and Post. I asked my now Fiancee if she wants to take a picture with them and she says yes. So we start making line.

We are nearing the front and after getting ready to approach Ethan, my girlfriend puts her hat and bag down on one of the tables to get ready for a picture... then Ethan, Hila, and Post start making their way off the stage because the next show needs to start prepping. 

We watch as they make their way through the crowd, my girlfriend grabs her bag and notices someone took her hat in the few seconds that she placed it down... So we begin to make our way through the crowd towards the door as we still see the Klein's making their way to the Green Room exit. Suddenly, Ethan makes eye contact with me and smiles.

""Hey Congrats!"" he yells over what is about 15 people and a table between us. 

""Thank you so much for the opportunity"" I yelled back. 
 
""Want to take some pictures!?"" he yells as he motions snapping a picture.

Didn't hesitate a second, grabbed my fiancees hand and started pushing through the crowd towards Ethan. We get through and Ethan says, ""we can take some pictures up in the green room."" and we begin walking through a bar area, and upstairs to the Green Room. 

We get upstairs and Post spots us, comes up to us and LITERALLY says, ""Congradu-fucking-lations!"" (like the song... yeah.... I Fanboyed and what?) after that Post went elsewhere and Ethan, Hila, My fiancee and I talked for a good couple of minutes, took some [pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/84kdv9/i_proposed_today_sorry_for_the_cringe/), and not wanting to take more of the their time, began saying our goodbyes. The last little bit of our conversation went something like this... 

Me: Thank you once again, for everything... Including the hats! 
Ethan: No problem, yeah, too bad its the same color as the one you had... but now you have an extra...
Fiancee: Well, I put my hat down for a few seconds while trying to take a picture with you guys on stage and someone grabbed it so I gonna take his. 
Ethan: Really? Thats messed up, here take this one. *Take the hat off his head and gives it to her*.... 


....

....

....

papa bless. 


Ethan and Hila were some of the nicest people I've met. It's weird how after just one interaction you have with someone you can come to a definitive conclusion on them. You can tell they are genuine in their interactions. I'm happy to be a fan.

Again, I'm not entirely sure why it took me so long to write this up or why I even wrote it up (karma definitely /s). But I thought sharing it with you guys would be cool. Hope you guys the best.

8n79yr,1,2018-05-30,"23, lied to my parents about school, facing the consequences, not sure how much of it I should willingly accept (need advice/ hear me out)",dogsgotocollege,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8n79yr/23_lied_to_my_parents_about_school_facing_the/,"\*new to terminology but basically somehow both the GC and scapegoat of an Nmom and an EDad\*

Yeah so

I dropped out of college for a hot sec, and understandably they're beyond pissed since they paid and I lied \(that's a whole other post but let's just agree that I was severely depressed/anxious and paralyzed by my fear of failure instilled in me throughout my childhood\)

So they gave me two choices: ""choose your friends or choose your family"". Meaning stay in the US and get cut off/disowned OR move back to India with them for \~a year\~ and live by their rules until I can prove to them that I'm stable enough to go back to school.

Being cut off wasn't actually a fear of mine. I had the job connections and a good support system in the US that ensured I wouldn't be left on the streets. But of course when you're the only child and your parents are threatening to disown you, and you feel incredibly guilty for your mistakes and don't want to lose your parents \+ cultural expectations, you choose ""family"". #FOG

Anyway within a week of telling them the big news about school, and after them constantly yelling and guilting and gaslighting and threatening me in every way they could think of hurting me, I was off to India. It's been a little less than 2 weeks now since that really fucking terrible first week, but the initial rage wave is over. Though I'm still being lectured, guilted, and attacked by my mother's random drunken emotional abuse.

And there are some things I don't know how to accept or if I should be accepting. And this is where I need some advice on whether or not to push back, and how to push back:

* My dad is pressuring me, and ultimately has complete control to force me, to work in a corporate office job in the city as opposed to a really great internship offered to me by my aunt\-in\-law that is right up my alley and in a stress\-free environment away from the city. Let's keep in mind I'm severely depressed/anxious here. And I dropped out of college because I allowed the expectations of my parents to hold me hostage and did very poorly in ALL of the standardized STEM majors I attempted. Everyone in my family and out of it who knows the situation agrees I should take the internship opportunity outside of the city/ my parent's supervision. The thing is I'm really in no position to speak up for myself since he has lost all trust in me and expects me to stop ""doing whatever I want"". He believes a corporate office job will put me in a routine that will be good for my mental health. Everyone else agrees that it won't be. He's the enabler, not the narcissist of the family, but I still feel the obligation to submit to him. I wish that I didn't.
* Delete all my social media/stop talking to all of my friends. Let's face it there is no way in hell I'm going to delete Facebook, Instagram and stop talking to my friends. Instagram is my creative outlet where I post the memes I make \(@dogsgotocollege check me out\). And Facebook is one of the only ways to stay connected to my overseas friends/family aka most to all of them. And It's pretty ridiculous they're asking me to delete my social media because I'm actually very inactive on both apps, especially with this recent onslaught of aggression my parents have towards it. But my mother in her drunkest state goes through my timeline to piss herself off and then proceeds to verbally attack me for hours until she falls asleep. I've spent the last few years allowing her micromanage my public persona, making things private, deleting photos and posts, etc. I don't know what to do about this at all. I finally blocked her today because she's so obsessed with it. But they won't shut up unless I cut off all contact with everyone outside of our 3\-person household. I'm going to be honest, I'd rather die.
* Stop playing the guitar, making music. This is somewhat connected to the last bullet point. Guitar used to be my salvation until the last month where I've felt no passion or motivation to make music like I used to. A big reason for this is because my mother hates my guitar so much and has terrorized me every time she sees the enjoyment that stems from it. She saw a month\-old video I posted of myself playing the guitar on Facebook and that's kind of how this most recent drama started. She drunkenly verbally attacked me, tore me down, attempted to kick me out of the house, and acted as if it was the first day I told her I dropped out of college. She just kept going on and on about how I was a liar, a cheat, took advantage of her and my dad for their money, was getting nowhere in life, etc. A lot of this has to do with her drinking, but a lot of it has to do with the anger she has for the things that make me happy. Because she believes these are the things that caused me to drop out of school: friends, social media, and my guitar. Sadly, she continued this rant by tearing me down and saying things like I'm not even good at playing guitar, I was stupid for thinking I'd ever be famous, I have no chance at doing well in the music business, etc. Sadly, it got to me. I know I should be using her mean words as motivation. But I'm in no place mentally to handle emotional abuse, and honestly never have been. I associate my guitar with a fear of my mom and the acceptance of failure now.

Not really sure what to do. What to accept. If I should fight back on some things that are obviously way out of line on their part. Not sure if I should just submit to them for as long as it takes for them to financially support me going back to the US and college. Not sure if I should save up money, take a loan, and go back myself without their help. Really just not sure what to do at all because this doesn't feel like my own life and honestly it never has.

It really does suck when your parents have such a huge control over your life. And even when you make your own decisions and go against their vision, you still feel them on your shoulders telling you that you're wrong, you're always going to be wrong, and that you can't do anything without their help and direction. It extra sucks when one of those parents drinks, goes from the most supportive to the least supportive person in a matter of seconds, and only feels better when she drags you down with her so that you revert to the mental state of a terrified child.

Yes, I know I fucked up. And they have every right to be upset and want to control me because they feel like this is all my fault and that they're absolved of any responsibility for the way I am. But how much should I allow them to control and how much should I try to show them that they, in fact, are a big enough reason for the way I turned out?

I'm 23, lied to my parents and am now facing the consequences. But for how long?

Also from what I've been reading on the subreddit, some of you are now financially independent, some married, some with kids, and your parents STILL try to control your lives. Was it worth keeping them in your lives? Do the pros outweigh the cons? Why do you still feel obligated to being their child, despite the different forms of abuse and control you had to endure??"
8n7eaz,2,2018-05-30,Exploitative employer- help please!,iamthehype_,dubai,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/8n7eaz/exploitative_employer_help_please/,"I’ve been working with this private company since last June, and I’ve been on a 1-year paid internship contract. I had emailed my one-month notice period on May 1 and everyone knows tomorrow (May 31) is my last day.

My job entails working from home, doing customer responses for client social media pages- this is 24x7 job, and since I started I’ve gotten only one day off from work, which was my birthday. I’ve worked throughout weekends, public holidays, festivals- everything. I’ve also been covering events for them all year.

I had gone in to the office Sunday and Monday to train my replacement, and I’m sick so I had informed my superior that I wouldn’t be coming in yesterday and today as I had to go to the doctor. Apparently there’s no such thing as communication, as I got a call from another coworker asking me why I wasn’t in and to come in to the office NEXT WEEK, after I resign. I told her no and she wouldn’t accept it for an answer, telling me I have to come in to make up for my sick leave (???) and train people.

This makes no sense for a number of reasons. Firstly, no one trained me when I joined. Secondly, I’ve already trained my replacement. Thirdly, the ‘training’ she wants me to do consists of taking screenshots and attaching them to emails to forward to clients. No one is taking no for an answer, and I’m afraid they’re going to withhold my salary if I don’t go in. Not like it’s a lot- I’m still receiving training pay despite working for a year, and despite having my clients go from 1 to 7.

What should I do? I don’t want to go in after I’ve resigned, and they can’t force me. Can I file a case saying they’re refusing to pay me despite having my notice period in writing, because I wouldn’t work after I resigned? The problem is because I’m an intern, they don’t sponsor me and I don’t have a labour card. I’m not exactly sure what my rights are, but this is ridiculous. I stuck with them for a year so it would look good on my resume and help with college apps, but I have no love lost for the company after how they’ve treated me since I started with them.

Hello everybody! It’s been a while. The sub has grown massively since I first posted my timeline, so it seems like there will be a lot of people who are unfamiliar with it. I’ll briefly introduce how this works, and those who are familiar can skip to the patch notes!


Generally speaking, Japanese high schools follow a trimester system. It is possible that UA might be using a semester system, but so far the dates have aligned with the trimester systems, so we will assume as such. We will adjust accordingly if it proves to be a different case.


Term 1 starts in April, usually the second week, and runs to mid-late July. Students usually have August and sometimes parts of surrounding months off.


Term 2 starts in September and runs to late December. Winter break is usually the last week or December and first week of January.


Term 3 runs from January to late March, when we have a break before the school year starts. 

There are a few ways we can tell where events in the story take place. First, in relation to each other. Horikoshi will usually tell us how far apart events in the story happen to each other. The second is through known events in the Japanese school schedules. For example, the dates when students change uniforms is a set time. While we can’t pinpoint the exact dates of the story events, we can still narrow down events to the week or so.


**How accurate is this timeline?**

Shortly after I posted this, I was linked to a timeline from the official guidebook, [here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/250678661064294411/362031037745856513/image.jpg?width=1552&amp;height=1164). The guidebook timeline is very vague, and only goes up to the beginning of summer break, but it does confirm that everything I had written up to that point was completely accurate. The only difference is where it places the training camp during summer break. I’m not sure if they’re suggesting it takes place in July (which is mathematically impossible due to the information Horikoshi gives us in the manga) or by putting it in the arrow as opposed to the actual main part of the month where all other events are placed that they’re trying to say that it takes place during summer break but not necessarily in July. (I’m still going with my timeline because the math fits. YMMV)


**Why does this matter?**


Using a timeline, we have a way of figuring out how much time had passed, and how much time could pass in the rest of the series. We also can use it to guess events that might happen using our knowledge of the school system, or how long the series might be.

**Patch Notes:**

I haven’t done too much maintenance since the last update (I was busy graduating from college) but I have been able to get some things done. I also have a few questions for you going forward!


•	Timeline is now accurate up to chapter 184.


•	Birthdays have been added for some non-class 1-A folks. I added in some more major U.A. students, such as the Big Three, Kendou, Tetsutetsu, Monoma, Shinsou, and Mei. This is to experiment a little, but I think having so many birthdays in the timeline is really cramped, so I’m tempted to remove them in the next update. I'm also wary of too many birthdays, as having dates included leads to a sense of finality to the placement of arcs when they aren't really set in stone. I place birthdays where they fit in roughly, but they could be in the completely wrong spot. Let me know what you think!


•	On the day of the culture festival, I included the time stamps for the events we got. I’m torn on whether I think it works, as I think it makes things look a lot messier. Do people like this? There’s some other major events that do that, so I could go back and add them for other events. 


Before we begin, I’d like to ask you one more question! What would you guys like to see next? My next few planned features are to add in pre series flashbacks, and potentially non-canon material (marked, of course) such as light novels, filler eps, and ovas. Please tell me what you prefer in the comments!

**A Note to Anime Onlies:** I've done my best to make this accessible to you, but please be aware that if you scroll past my marker, there will be tons of untagged spoilers.

* Day after encounter: Chapter 70. Class occurs.


**END OF TERM 1: Early to Mid July.**


Notes:
Term 1 takes up about 65 chapters. At some point between this point (chap 70) and chap 80, Horikoshi proclaimed that the series was around 20% done. We are unsure of the exact date the interview took place, but I’d guess in between chapter 70 and chapter 80 as a rather loose estimate. Season 2 ends here.

At night, Bakugou vs Izuku occurs. (Note: This occurs roughly 2 weeks after Kamino, placing AFO vs All Might in Mid-August. Generally, Term 2 starts the first week of September. We also know the License Exam takes place twice a year, September and April.)


**END OF SUMMER BREAK- First week of September.**

Notes: Summer break runs for 50 chapters. Calculating when the arcs take place is difficult, and I was forced to count backwards from the end of break in order to measure things. I’ve already brought up the issue of the accuracy of the School Trip Arc’s placement, but license exam and all the arcs relative to each other should be accurate.


**Beginning of Term 2: First week of September**

* A few days later, presumably early-Mid September: Chapters 134-136. The hero meeting occurs, to plan Eri’s rescue. Izuku, Ochako, Kirishima, and Tsuyu are to remain on standby.

* Late September: Chapter 137. Todoroki, Izuku, and Iida have a conversation in the cafeteria. Students have switched to winter uniforms. Lockrock appears to discover the villain’s hideout. (Note: Usually students switch to winter uniforms in October, however here they seem to be switching in late September.)

* End of November: Chapter 184. Eri becomes a ward of UA, the Pussycats and Kota come to visit. 


* An unknown amount of time later, presumably still end of November, beginning of December: JP Hero Billboard Chart is announced. 

**Current End Point**

As of right now, we’re coming up to the end of November. It isn’t clear exactly when Billboard charts come out relative to the Pussycats’ visit, but I assume it isn’t too far away. It doesn't seem to be the same day, however. I would guess November. Some other notes: The cultural festival most likely takes place in November, since the timing lines up. It also lines up with Culture Day in Japan, which is Nov. 3. It’s common for schools to have their cultural festivals on or around this day, and the timeline seems to hint at this being the case. 


So what’s next? The major events coming up would be end of term exams and the beginning of winter break in December. Winter break in Japan usually runs for the week before and after New Years, although depending on how U.A.’s terms are set up, it could be a little different. 


This means we a little less than a month until winter break starts, and only about a month until New Years! This also means there’s only about 4 months left in the entire school year. For some stats, the first 4 months of the school year (April-July) covered about 6 arcs, if you go by the wiki’s count, and 65 chapters. The middle 4 months (August-November) also covered 6 arcs, and a whopping 115 chapters so far, if we count 184 as the end of November. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to estimate 6 more arcs before the end of the school year, but there easily could be more. So let’s maybe consider this a lower bound for the rest of the year. 
Have fun, and happy speculating! And as always, if you have any questions or corrections, feel free to let me know!

And my anxiety keeps telling me, ""Haha, you're gonna be stuck here forever!""

I wake up nearly every morning crying and screaming because I don't want to go to my stupid job. I feel like I'm gonna majorly snap one of these days if I don't get out of here.

I don't know how to keep up hope as I try to make my way out of here. I just landed two internships, but my anxiety is telling me they won't lead to a job because 'it's too competitive out there, especially for writers'.

I don't feel like I can be patient anymore. I feel like I'm going to walk into work today, grab a knife and slam it into the side of my neck.

Why do I have to deal with this? This isn't life! How am I supposed to stay calm and work things out when my anxiety is torturing me every single day?

8n8rtl,2,2018-05-30,My frustrating learning experience.,AnGinger,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/8n8rtl/my_frustrating_learning_experience/,"Hey all,

I’m in Ad Operations at a Toronto media buying agency. 

It’s my first full-time job out of college (graduating in June) and I’ve been with the company for close to a year (started as an intern, then part-time).

Now that I’m able to commit fully to this company and job, I’m learning and responsible for much more than I’m used to. 

So far, it has been a frustrating experience. I know what I’m capable of and how well I can excel here, but I’m hindered by one issue that has persisted for as long as I can remember: attention to detail. 

It hurts, because it’s essential for me to have this, and I am learning and getting better at it. That’s why it bothers me so much. I want to grow and make this a non-issue. I understand that it’s only been two months since I started, but I’m the person who wants to solve this as soon as possible.

How did you guys do it, or continue to do it? I’ve tried a few tricks but I just can’t make one stick."
8n9qs4,47,2018-05-30,Wedding budget breakdown: 30 guests at an AirBnB,elizabethdoesphysics,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/8n9qs4/wedding_budget_breakdown_30_guests_at_an_airbnb/,"[We were married April 14, 2018](https://imgur.com/a/fwg3czr) (link leads to photos); we got engaged Dec 2016. We went through many wedding ideas. First, we thought traditional wedding with all the family. That would have been huge, so we scrapped that plan. Then we made a list to compare eloping and a small wedding. In the end, we chose small wedding. This post outlines our process in planning the wedding, as well as our budget.

First, we each separately made a three item list of what was most important to us for the wedding. Here's my list:

* Photography

* March (date was important to me, but we settled on April)

* As one-stop-shop as possible

Here's my husband's list:

* Cake

* Cake

* Cake

My husband was a groom-zilla. I wish his list would have reflected his impossible to gauge tastes. :P **My advice**: the three item list is amazing. Use it as a starting guide for your discussions on what is important and what is not important to the two of you.

##Budget

My parents gave me $5k. His parents initially gave us $3k, but they kept paying for things and I lost track of what they all paid for. My budget spreadsheet says our budget ended up being $11.5k and we have $4k leftover. That can't be right, because alcohol is not on my spreadsheet. **My advice**: pick a budget and stick to it. We were fortunate that my husband's parents and my parents were able to generously help us and stop me from panicking. **More advice**: we both struggle spending large sums of money. I cried a lot whenever we spent more than $1k on anything, just because I had grown up poor and I wanted to spend the money on my student loans. But, we talked about it and it was very important to both of us to have a special day spent with our very close friends and family. We wanted to do this for them, and that helped us both with spending money.

Anyway, based on the previously mentioned lists, we figured out our budget breakdown:

* Photography: $1200

* Venue: $1400

* Food (not cakes): $2000

* Cakes: $250 (we made them)

* Rentals: $500

* Rings: $2000

* Wedding dress: $100 (yep, that's the budget I set)

* Stationary: $100 (most of this was postage we ended up not using when we thought we were doing a traditional wedding)

* Decor: $100

##Venue: a journey through indecisiveness

The process of choosing our venue was difficult. I was finishing up my Ph.D work in WA state, and my husband was job hunting. We chose WA state and started looking at venues there. I did SO MUCH RESEARCH. Every venue I found my husband shot down. It was really frustrating. Eventually, I told him how frustrating it was to find venues in our tiny budget and told him I had had enough. He had to figure it out. That's when he got a job offer in Chicago and I had my internship in CA. So all the venue work in WA was just wasted. **My advice**: when life changes, your plans might changes too. This can be a bummer. For us, it was exciting because the choices in WA were pretty bad.

After my internship, we sat down on the AirBnB website and made a list of AirBnBs that allow events, were within our budget, had multiple bedrooms, etc. We wanted our grad school friends to be able to come to our wedding and we wanted to provide a place for them to stay. Again, I found venue options and my husband turned them down. I told him, again, that he had to figure it out and I gave him a deadline: October. He made me really nervous by not picking a place until October 29, but he did it and booked it! **My advice**: it is okay to get frustrated with your partner. Express your frustrations. Decide together on an action plan and **set a deadline you both agree on**. October turned out to be a bit late for me, and I got anxious. But I didn't let my anxiety get to me; I trusted my partner would do what we had agreed on.

##Photography

I determined early on that I wanted to spend money on the things that would last forever and the things the guests would remember. Photography, food, and rings made up the majority of our budget. We chose our photographer based on interviews with three different photographers we found. We ended up increasing our photography budget (from $1k to $1.2k) to hire the photographer we really wanted. My husband wasn't much of a drama queen during the photographer picking process, but I certainly was. My father photographed weddings when I was a child, and he quit the business just as digital camera were becoming a thing. I relied on his input heavily when we were picking a photographer. **My advice**: photos are going to last forever, so maybe don't skimp on this. You can get a good deal having a friend photograph your wedding, but consider paying for someone who has done this before, if your budget allows. **Bonus advice**: I wish I had recorded our vows and the speeches our wedding party and dads gave. They were amazing.

##Rings

I purchased my [wedding band in Montana](https://imgur.com/7qh5CKT) (edit: link to photo of ring), where there is no sales tax. My ring was also on sale, so I ended up paying $1400 for my wedding band, which includes insurance, shining up my engagement ring, and rhodium plating it. My engagement ring we found together on etsy for $300 with shipping. My husband purchased a titanium band online for $100. My husband had no idea what he wanted in a ring. So, whenever we looked at rings for me, I asked what he liked or didn't like about bands he saw. From that info, we were able to deduce that he wanted a simple band that didn't cost much. We talked very openly about how much my ring set was costing and he was comfortable with the cost. **My advice**: watch for sales and consider going to a nearby state to save on sales tax.

##AirBnB and their weirdo reaction to wedding

Let's talk about that venue we chose. We picked an AirBnb, messaged the owners about having a family event there, and they said no problem but we are the only caterer allowed. We agreed that would work and booked the venue. We began talks about catering in January, where I accidentally said wedding. They *freaked the fuck out*, threatening to charge us more, insisting they never okayed a wedding but a *family event*, we can't have outside caterers etc. etc. **My advice**: if you do AirBnB, ask specifically what they mean by events being allowed.

I started looking into alternative venues because they really pissed me off. My husband sent a reply to their threatening emails explaining that our wedding *is a family event*; we have no DJ, we hate dancing, and we are making our own cakes. I think he used the phrase ""we can call it a birthday party if that makes you feel better, because that's basically what it is going to be"". He said we are reasonable people who thought we booked an AirBnB managed by reasonable people and we are willing to work with them to make our family event happen. In the end, they still were kind of asshats about wedding vs family event, but they let us use their downstairs space for free for the ceremony and dinner, and gave us a discounted rate for using the space until 11pm.

##Food

For food, we chose steak because that's what my husband wanted. I wanted our wedding to be as inexpensive as possible, so I was advocating for Sunday brunch with a waffle bar. We compromised with a coffee bar (which I loved) and steak for him. Rentals were coordinated through the AirBnB people. The event coordinator didn't tell me she wouldn't be there on Saturday, and I only had her number. So, when the rentals hadn't showed up by noon, I was flipping the fuck out. She had said we would meet Thursday to talk logistics, but then a meeting of hers ran long and we met briefly and agreed to meet Friday. Something came up on her end, so we agreed to meet early Saturday. Then, she was just gone, so I didn't know the plan, which made my anxiety go through the fucking roof. In the end, the rentals were setup based on the timeline I made/ demanded, and everything was fine. We did not tip them.

#Dress, jewelry, hair, makeup

I made my dress [based on this sweater/ skirt combo](https://goo.gl/images/SoEZEo). I bought a sweater and then sewed a [skirt based on this tutorial](https://youtu.be/aOUtmg5LQfI). A colleague finished the hem, and I ironed it the day of. I was determined to spend less than $100 because I went dress shopping at a consignment shop and the lady told me she couldn't help me with ""such a ridiculous budget"". I'm stubborn, so I showed her! I wore an old prom dress under the skirt and sweater, which added bulk to my midsection I'm not enthused about. But, for $100, I think I did okay. Plus, now I have a sweater I can wear to work and remember what a fantastic day we had. **My advice**: if you want to make your dress, you need to be okay with it not looking amazeballs, especially if your sewing machine is a hello kitty sewing machine and you know nothing about the shitty fabric you purchased because it matched the sweater that was on sale.

I wore jewelry I already owned and shoes I already owned. I did my hair and makeup myself. I followed a hair tutorial I found on one of those facebook DIY groups a long long long time ago. It was a style I had tried before, so I felt confidant I could do it. My makeup was how I normally do it for conferences: simple. **My advice**: if you do your own hair and makeup, practice it or choose styles you know you can do.

My husband wore a suit he purchased for job interviews and just had it tailored a little bit. Our wedding party was told the colors were blue and silver, and they were allowed to talk amongst themselves about what to wear. My sister found a dress at a store closing sale for $20 and it came with free jewelry. My bestish Mensch (I like The Office) owned all the clothes he wore. He's quite awesome. I think the best man purchased a shirt and tie once he got to the US (he lives in Germany). **My advice**: if you aren't picky about what people wear, give them a color palette and maybe a few ideas. My mom was fucking annoying as fuck about what she was supposed to wear (I had told her ""clothes that are not white, ivory, or could be misconstrued as white or ivory."" This was much too vague), so I eventually told her ""pants suit in blue"". She found a floral print pants suit. My dad wanted to get a cape from the new Antonio Banderas line. I said sure. He was sad I didn't freak out, so he bought a suit and new shoes instead.

##Flowers, decor

We DIY'ed the flowers because I didn't want to spend money on flowers and decor. I followed [this tutorial](http://www.instructables.com/id/Book-Page-Roses/) for the roses but used glue stick because fuck hot glue. I followed a [video like this one](https://youtu.be/6elb2EO_ZO0) for the origami flowers. I made the flowers in stages over several months while writing my dissertation. First, I cut the book pages to size using a heavy duty craft cutter. Then, I folded the origami flowers (but didn't glue them) and folded the roses (but didn't cut them). Then I cut the rose petal shape and unfolded them (but didn't cut them in sections). I used glue stick for the origami flowers, so I had a huge collection of finished petals we assembled the day before. I used floral wire from the dollar store as stems (we used hot glue to attach the flowers). **My advice**: DIY projects are super fun but also time consuming. Your time is worth money, too. I realized I didn't have time to make the bouquet of my dreams, so I splurged and bought it. I made my sister's bouquet and we made our corsages.

##Guests and invites

The biggest disappointment was we invited 29 guests and two never showed up even though they RSVPed yes and we had been texting about visiting FermiLab. I am still extremely mad at them, as they knew they weren't coming because they had to buy plane tickets. I have family close to Chicago, so we could have last minute filled those empty seats. That's the one thing I am super bitter about. They wanted to save money, so they didn't tell us they were backing out. Then, she bought a designer wedding dress for her wedding. I don't understand some people. **My advice**: I have none. I'm fucking pissed at them.

We DIY'ed our invites using a kit my mom found. I stated the number of people invited and wrote their names on the invite to be crystal clear about who was invited. Not really superb etiquette, but I had read enough reddit posts about invite snafus that I decided to just make it as clear as possible. We specifically stated no gifts on the invite, and then my mom, sister, and MIL insisted we had to have a registry. We made a honeyfund to shut them up, which didn't work. So, we made an amazon list. We literally received nothing from that damn registry. We did receive honeyfund gifts and quite a few people brought us sentimental gifts. Our friend framed a map from our Star Wars RPG force and destiny campaign, for example. We both cried when we opened that gift. **My advice**: You know your friends better than your family knows your friends. If you know a registry is a fucking stupid idea, don't do it.

I put my mom in charge of entertainment for the children. My husband's family is primarily in Germany, but his siblings and their families were able to make it over for the wedding. My mom went to the dollar store and bought coloring books, crayons, cardboard dollhouses with cardboard doll cutouts, dinosaur toys, and a bunch of other stuff. We had zero whiney children because my mom was always pulling out something new for them to do. The two older ones didn't speak much English, so having activities for them really helped. **My advice**: Sometimes parents forget to bring enough things to entertain their kids; having a variety of fun things is a good backup.

##Cake

Finally, let's talk cake. Since we weren't allowed outside caterers, we made our cakes. We wanted a cake buffet, and we are pretty good bakers. My MIL ended up taking the baking project away from us, so I got to make one cake, my sister made one cake, and my husband assembled one cake. **My advice**: sometimes people will offer to help. You can tell them to fuck off. My MIL also took over table centerpieces and we ended up with really cheap looking crepe paper flowers hot glued around glass jars with LED candles in them. If I had said I had centerpieces covered, I would have been a bit more frantic on Friday, but the centerpieces would have looked the way I wanted. So, it turned out okay. Plus, it gave my husband's nieces a fun project, and once I learned they worked on them, the centerpieces didn't look so tacky. They looked like something someone made for me with love.

TLDR:

The good: so much yummy cake, beautiful photos, homemade dress, fun memories, food was fucking amazing, we got to spend time with our friends and family and it was amazing

The bad: Photographer was two weeks late getting us our photos, AirBnB/ caterer was high maintenance and then dropped the ball the day of

The awful: A couple who RSVPed yes and were very important to me didn't show up and I wanted to (still want to) murder them.

8na2a0,3,2018-05-30,My mom doesn't listen to me and it may have ruined my job interview,minacciano,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8na2a0/my_mom_doesnt_listen_to_me_and_it_may_have_ruined/,"Most of the time my mom is pretty awesome and helps me out if I'm ever in trouble with something. But she did something that I legit just can't get over.

I turned in my resume and a cover letter for an internship and I got a reply back and a time for an interview. When I went to the interview, I was really stressed but I still told my mom under no circumstances should she contact the person I'm interviewing with and she should not go in with me.

I couldn't find the building so I called the person that I'm interviewing with (which looks bad ugh). But I told my mom not to call him ONCE AGAIN. Then she called him as she was trying to look for the building. 

When we were in the wrong building and he returned the call she said, ""Oh this is minacciano's mom, how about I give her the phone now."" I genuinely wish she hadn't done that and I thought that I should've gotten my dad to drive me to the interview instead because he wouldn't be violating what I told him not to do. I know that my mom was doing it because she wanted to help but she so often just doesn't listen to me and it makes me really angry and sad sometimes.

After I found the building, she went inside with me. I told her not to UNDER LITERALLY ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. It makes me look so bad for the interview, and even if me getting lost did make me look bad, my mom coming in with me into the interview makes me look way worse, and way dependent on her. (Even if I'm still a teenager) I'm just so extremely sad about this because she violated the two things that I told her to not do and it may have cost me some points at the interview.

Mandatory Info:

* Caucasian/F/26

* 5'6

* 155lbs

* No current medications, don't smoke

* Rash covering most of my body, basically everywhere but my face

* Condition going on for 2.5 weeks

This all started about 3 weeks ago when I was treated for strep throat. On 05/10/2018 I was prescribed a 10-day prescription for Amoxicillin. No rapid strep test or culture was done to confirm strep, but I get strep about every 18 months and I (and my doctor) figured that's what was going on. Fatigue, pus in my throat, etc.

I took the full round of antibiotics and felt fine. Near the end of the cycle of antibiotics (on 05/17/2018) I woke up with a red, raised rash all over my stomach and back. Over the next couple of days this spread to my arms and thighs. I waited it out thinking it might be stress-related because I had just finished finals and started a new internship that week. I was treating with Benadryl and applying cortizone to problem spots. The spots were generally not itchy or painful.

On 05/22/2018 after the rash seemed to get worse, I was prescribed a Methylprednisolone 4mg 6-day dose pack. I did not start the dose pack that night and was going to wait til the following morning. That next morning (05/23/2018) I woke up feeling very sick again with my throat swollen and red. I went back to the doctor without starting the steroid pack as intended.

At this point the doctor thought I might have mono since treating mono with Amoxicillin can cause a rash sometimes, but then the mono spot test came back negative. The doctor then prescribed me another 10-day antibiotic, Cefdinir. I started both the Cefdinir and the Methylprednisolone that day, 05/23/2018. She said that if the test was a false negative and I *did* have mono, the antibiotic wouldn't help and I would just have to ride it out but that the steroid would help with my rash regardless.

I finished the steroid pack two days ago (05/28/2018) and there has been no improvement in my skin condition. After starting the Cefdinir, I felt better the very next day as far as my fatigue/sore throat. I was fine at work all last week and hung out with friends this weekend, etc. This leads me to believe I don't have mono since the antibiotic did help and because I haven't truly been knocked on my ass with illness. The rash doesn't seem to be subsiding at all. I can't tell if it's getting *worse* necessarily, but the last couple of days the spots seem to be drying out a bit? It isn't ever painful. Sometimes a couple spots will itch but it's nothing persistent. 

I have never experienced a drug allergy before and have taken Amoxicillin and Cefdinir in the past with no issues. I haven't changed any of my products like soap/shampoo/perfume or tried any new foods (I have no known food allergies anyway).

I've attached two side-by-side photos. In those, the left photo is from Day 1 of the steroid pack and the right photo is Day 6. The third photo is a close-up of the spots on my stomach.

8nayof,2,2018-05-30,I am attracted to my new colleague - what to do?,th0ke,hsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/8nayof/i_am_attracted_to_my_new_colleague_what_to_do/,"There is a new girl who started at our work place a month ago and she makes me really scared of going to work.
Not because of something she does, but because I know that everytime I go to work, I will have a rollercoaster of emotions during the day because I am attracted to her.
I find her really sweet, kind and attractive which makes short circuit around her, feeling extremely akward, and feeling like I watch my self from the outside.
To make things more complicated, she is sitting by a desk right across of mine facing my direction, she reminds me of my ex-girlfriend, and i have the feeling that *she knows* that I am really affected by her presence.
I want to be able to have a down to earth conversation with her, maybe even ask her out, but it is like I cannot break the cycle.
Also, I am a Dane having an internship in Germany, so speaking in a foreign languages also makes me more nervous.

Do you have any experience similar to this?
Do you have any advice on what I can do, to make things easier for me and her?

Either way, it always feels good when people can relate, cause most often my closer friends doesn't get it completely.

8nbb8v,0,2018-05-30,Applied some slight text dread game the last couple of weeks. LTR just exploded out of the blue over text and I had to explain. Was it right?,Vargelkin,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/8nbb8v/applied_some_slight_text_dread_game_the_last/,"Basically,

Me and my girlfriend only see each others sporadically at the moment because she's in another city in an internship.
We keep up mostly by text, and spend about 8-10 days together per month.

I was a bit annoyed with how much we were texting, so I toned down on the texting a lot. More straight to the point answers, less texting, ""okay"", ""alright"". However we still had bouts of back and forth live texting, like real.conversations. Wasn't rly trying to dread her as she did nothing wrong, just not text so much.

I noticed a bit of aggressiveness in her lately. Asking me where I am, why did I say X or Y, and just a bit of an attitude. Tday she sent a couple of texts and I told her I didn't like the tone of them, was there something she wanted to say?

Bam. Wall of text. Says she feels I'm not i terested in talking to her anymore, I seem annoyed by her, do I even want to be with her still?
Then she proceeds to tell me about every little ambiguous thing I said during the relationship about other girls, that she thinks I'm seeing other women or want to, that she feels really jealous and moody. She asks me what changed. 
I tell her that she's in the wrong, but she video calls me and tells me that I've never been that way and she won't take that for an answer. She started crying and telling me she wishes I would tell her more that I miss her and love her, that she needs to know what's going on.

I end up telling her that I'm frustrated with some things atm and that I feel trapped by a few things. Tell her I didn't want to tell her, but since it affects her so much that's what it is. I tell her that I love her and want to be with her, and that I'm not pursuing other women.
At the end the conversation shifted towards me and that's where I think I kinda failed. I wanted to just comfort her, but it ended up looking like me telling jer about my problems. I don't think it's a huge deal, but is it ok?
Honestly felt like I had to comfort her, she doesn't deserve to be miserable she's been good."
8nbjkl,2,2018-05-30,"Graduating in 2 weeks, feeling like I missed out/regret due to injury. [Advice please?] [Long]",highschoolhelp69,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/8nbjkl/graduating_in_2_weeks_feeling_like_i_missed/,"Hi guys, I know this post is long as hell, but its a really personal story and i hope you guys can read it and let me know what you think, and to anyone who is still in high school reading this can take some insight from it.

I am graduating high school in 2 weeks, and I felt like I missed out in high school, cuz I almost never went to parties or chilled with people. I had a pretty normal school experience up until Christmas break of freshman year. I had friends and we would chill but I never drank, smoked weed, or partied (I was a late developer, I didn't even want to do these things until about 10th grade). 

But in 9th grade freshman year, took a trip with my family and I fell off a ledge and I absolutely FUCKED my back. I had to take classes from home for all of 10th and 11th grades. I stopped talking to most of my friends and soon I had barely any social contact. I was lonely as shit and I couldn't do anything about it because I couldn't leave the house. 

This sort of changed when I met this girl in a game lobby online (this was in January of my junior year, at this point I still couldn't go to school for six hours a day, but I had some mobility for a few hours and I tried to leave the house at least every other day so I wouldn't be a pale goblin) She was 2 years younger than me but we really hit it off in game chat so I added her on Snap. We got close really quickly, FaceTiming for hours, etc. I asked her out and we started ""online"" dating. I say it with air quotes because we found out we lived only 30 miles away, so we met in person like every other week, until the summer between junior and senior year.

 By then, the physical therapy had really worked its magic, and I was almost to my old self. I could walk around for hours, I was so happy. I felt like I could get my life back, and I wanted to. At this point, I was more than ready to start doing the shit I felt like I should've been doing since 10th grade. During the summer, I started seeing my girlfriend at least 3 or 4 times a week, we had sex, smoked weed together, and I fell in love with her

That summer was great, probably the best of my life up until that point. I still hadn't gone to any parties though, and I didn't have any close friends at my school (i had stopped talking to pretty much everyone at school) so I really only talked to my girlfriend, a few of her friends, and a few online friends. 

When school started back up, I wanted to get back into the social aspect of high school, so I started chilling with my old friends a couple times, I ripped some oil in my friends basement, but it wasn't really like it used to be. After 2.5 ish years of being gone, we had grown differently. I wasn't part of the inside jokes and I wasn't really part of the group and shit. Since school had started up again, and I was pretty busy with extracurriculars, I didn't want to try so hard making friends at school again, especially since it cut into spending more time with my gf (I thought i was madly in love with her but thinking back on it I might've been just lonely... it definitely wasn't healthy that she was one of the only people I could count as a friend)

 so anyway, senior year.. i chilled a bit in the beginning of the year, but when I decided to just focus on my relationship I kind of withdrew at school. I was friendly but not friends with most of the people I knew. I got discouraged and didn't even bother to try. In one of my classes (an acting class in a dark studio room) which was full of underclassmen and people i'd never talked to, I just pushed 3 chairs together, plugged in my earbuds, and took a fucking nap. I really regret not trying to make friends cuz maybe I wouldn't be in this situation right now haha.

 I'm getting sidetracked though I wasn't unhappy at all, I was actually really happy. I've always been kind of socially awkward and I think of myself as kind of ugly, so when I was younger I would always joke that i'd be single and die as a virgin. I was proud of myself for proving myself wrong, making the best of a bad situation, etc. 

Can you guess where this is going? My girlfriend dumped me in March this year (we don't have to go into why..) and it fucked. me. up.  I still don't fully understand why it impacted me so so much, whether it was just the loneliness, losing someone who I could cuddle with, confide in, tell her anything, someone to smoke with, someone to call when I needed support, and being the person who could do that for her. etc.  maybe if i actually had friends at the time it wouldn't have been so bad.  or maybe it was even just petty jealousy (I thought i was fine with it until i heard she'd gotten a new boyfriend, thats when I fell apart).

again, im getting sidetracked. despite how much i'm talking about her, she actually isn't the point of the story. for all of march and the first half of april, i just chilled at home, got high, watching netflix and feeling sorry for myself. I realized i was being pathetic and a pussy so i decided to change that.

I started being more outgoing and in like a week, i made a friend in my acting class, a sophomore, rob. We were just 'school friends' at first, we would order pizza to the school for lunch, talk shit during class, and go to starbucks during class (our teacher was a real old guy who never noticed what was going on in his class, people would just leave after he marked them present) and eventually we started chilling outside of school, he introduced me to his 'group' of people, and im not like a central member of the group, but there's like 4-5 people and we chill on the weekends sometimes, play fort, go swimming, crush a few beers, etc etc etc.

at the same time i started to be more outgoing with my senior classmates/ old friends as well, and i realized that i was just being stupid or awkward in september cuz we chilled and my social anxiety comes out a bit, but after a few tokes or beers i forget about it and im pretty outgoing and fun (at least i hope so about that second part lol)... i did what i set out to do, I went to a few parties, nothing huge, I went to prom and an afterparty, and i enjoyed myself. the parties were really fun, and there was drinking (and weed) at the parties, but it wasn't like the movies portray at all.  i know, i know, movies are usually full of shit about that stuff but it still makes me wonder what it would've been like if i went to a huge party.

so now its basically june. classes are over, finals are over, we just have senior internships for 2 weeks and then high schools done. and now i am left to reflect on what i did well and wrong in high school and looking forward to high school.

I know i'll have way more chances to go apeshit and party like crazy during college, but im not sure if thats a good thing or not. at least half of my friends are younger than me (i turn 18 this summer), my girlfriend was younger than me, and my parents tell me (and i notice this myself) that im a lot more immature than the kids in my year.

this doesn't concern me that much right now, but it makes me think: what if my social development was stunted from being a shut in for so long. anyways, what i really wonder about is how to stop myself from partying every day and going absolutely crazy during college, (because i feel like i have to make up for missed time during college). i know if i party too much in college i might sorely regret it and end up writing another one of these in 4 years. 

but at the same time, i don't want to let life pass me by yet again, college is supposed to be the best years of your life, and its really the last chance to make lifelong friends and do utterly retarded shit with your friends. i also dont want to be the guy whos 30 and still wants to act like he's 20 bc he didn;t get his fill of that lifestyle while all his friends are getting married and having kids.

now that im graduating high school, i was like slammed with the realization that i have to start growing up soon, and im really afraid of growing up without getting a chance to be a kid and have fond memories to look back on like everyone else.

and as i wrote out this story, i realized i did more in high school than i originally thought, trying different things, being in a relationship, being in multiple different friend groups, etc. 

but at the same time i was never super close in a group for all of high school, like i didn't go to concerts and trips and paintball like a lot of other people did, and i feel like i missed out on being part of a close-knit high school clique, and i feel like it wont be like that in college (for anyone, not just me). college students are supposed to be adults, and i think their social life and friend group patterns reflect that (i wouldn't know though, i could be dead wrong).

TLDR: if could summarize this whole post, i guess i'd say im afraid of growing up slower than my peers b/c i started later. i dont want to grow up too quick to catch up, and then miss out on the best parts of my life because of that. at the same time im afraid of being 'that guy' stereotype: the guy who does nothing of substance and hangs out with people who are much younger than him cuz hes so immature (i honestly look like i fit that stereotype lmao).

do any college students have anythin to say about that? and thanks for reading, i appreciate it and i hope it was entertaining, interesting, or insightful to at least one of you.

edit: lol i just checked, i wrote almost 2,000 fuckin words in like 40 minutes lol

8ncfly,238,2018-05-30,I've Witnessed My First Blackpill,mrbasic-,Braincels,https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/8ncfly/ive_witnessed_my_first_blackpill/,"**Introduction**  
Ok, so I have been a long time lurker of both braincels and inceltears. I read posts from both subreddits, trying to see the viewpoint of each side. With that being said, I have made efforts to see if there really is a difference with how people who consider themselves as incels are treated in today's society, and the result is...saddening.

**Story**  
I have recently moved to a new state for a summer internship. Yesterday, I decided to explore the area, and landed at a French fries place. The place was kinda small so there was very little room at the front to order food. I walked in behind a group consisting of 3 average looking females. It was clear that one of the girls, let's say S, was the leader. S was discussing with the other two girls what they should get.

One of the cashiers called out for the next person to come up and order. S told the cashier that they were still figuring out what to get. S turns to see who's behind her and we make eye contact. She smiles and says ""oh you can go ahead if you know what you want."" I respond by saying ""oh, honestly I'm still deciding myself. This is my first time here."" This causes S to laugh. S then moves a bit closer and proceeds to tell me that shes been here a few times and could help me decide. Being a really shy person, I politely declined. She gave one more smile and turned back to her group. Now, I'm no Chad, just a normie so I was somewhat surprised about all of this. Not wanting to hold up the line, I look behind me to tell the person they can go in front of me and...that's when it happened.

I turn around and I'm met with two eyes behind glasses looking at me. To describe him, he was a scrawny guy with acne on his face and a crooked nose.  I'm really tall so he stood a few inches below my chest; it's safe to say he was in need of a haircut and shave. His apparel was fine, but it looked like he just rolled out of bed to get a quick bite to eat. After like a second of just staring, I say ""Hey man, I'm still deciding so you can go in front of me."" ""Ok, cool."" he says and I step behind him. In my eyes, he just seemed like a normal guy trying to get some food, but not in the eyes of S and her group.

Assuming I was still behind her, S turns around a shoots a quick glance behind her. Seeing who was now behind her, her eyes get wide and she quickly turns back around. She must have said something to her group because both girls look behind her and begin giggling. The next few seconds was nothing but pure awkwardness. The guy finally breaks the silence by asking if the group was in line. S does not say a word. Instead, one of her friends states ""go ahead."" The guy moves forward and all three girls move as he passes by as if he had a contagious disease. My jaw literally dropped. I just witnessed something I thought was a lie. There is, in fact, a group of individuals who are just...rejected by women.

While the guy was ordering, S shoots one more glance behind her and we make eye contact again. She had the audacity to smile and ask if I found something. I simply nod, move past her and her group, order my food, and leave.

**Conclusion**  
First and foremost, I would like to say I'm sorry. I am sorry that I thought you guys were making this up or just being butthurt that one girl rejected you and you swore off and hated all women.

Secondly, I would like to state that I **am not** and **will not** support the extreme views and actions found in this sub...but I get it. We live in a society where attractiveness decides how we are treated; it's unfair. It sucks. No one should have to deal with what I witnessed yesterday.

Finally, I see that sometimes you guys don't take normie stories seriously. To give a brief description of me, I'm 6'4, 250lb, black, and average build. If you **absolutely** need more proof, or just someone to talk/vent to, you can PM me. I feel that everyone deserves someone to listen to them and be there for them. I just ask that you be respectful and talk to me like a human being and I will do the same.  

Thank you for reading my story."
8nclc1,24,2018-05-30,Highlights From a Lifetime of My JustNoMom,linkian19,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8nclc1/highlights_from_a_lifetime_of_my_justnomom/,"Hello all! I'm a recent lurker to this sub and after reading a decent amount of posts I thought I would throw some of my experiences into the ring. As an FYI I'm the OH in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8mu3zy/they_suck_the_life_out_of_me/) where my mom (the MIL in that post) wants to move in with us when baby comes.

We don't have a clever nickname for her yet, but Tapeworm was tossed out in the other post. I thought that was pretty fitting but if you guys have any suggestions on a name feel free to toss them out.

In this post I thought it would be good to just list out some highlights of things that have stood out to me throughout my life. So these won't be full on stories but if you'd like me to clarify or delve deeper into something I'll try to in the comments (or make a separate post if needed). 

Bit of Background: I'm the youngest child in my family so I've always been the baaaaaby. Mom and dad are divorced (not uncommon, I know). There's never been a period where I've known them to be together (I think they divorced when I was around 2 years old or something). This is important because I think it's fair to say that I spent most of my time with mom. They had joint custody of me and for a good part of my life I was living between two houses. Couple days at dad's, few days at mom's, weekends switched, etc. Even with that I believe my mom had the lions share of time spent with me. I say all this because I'm sure I've internalized a lot of her issues or dismissed it as ""that's just how she is"" so I think it will be good for me to get some of this out here. I have one brother who is 10 years older than me and then two stepsisters and one stepbrother from when my dad re-married (we won't be focusing on them unless I write a separate post about my Step Mom).

These will likely be from more recent memory as I have a pretty terrible memory when it comes to my childhood, but let's dive in!

* Always calls me her baby or peep.
* Comments that she doesn't like/understand why I'm wearing what I'm wearing. - My OH is amazing at helping me wear more than just blue jeans and a graphic t-shirt and sometimes I'll wear some bright colors or something out of my comfort zone.
* Comments on how she misses my long hair. - Used to have long hair for most of my life but got it all chopped off in college because it was time to not have long hair anymore.
* Comments that she prefers me to not have a beard. - While it's not the best beard, I like it and I can damn well choose to have one or not. I look 12 years old without one, so deal with it mom.
* Comments that she prefers me to wear my glasses instead of my contacts. - Glasses are fine, but a hassle if I have to go do anything physical. I don't want sweat on my glasses!
* Occasional comments on my weight. - Yes, I know I'm overweight, thanks.
* Various highly inappropriate comments framed as ""jokes"" in regards to OH and I's sex life. - Should be noted that we have never told her about anything we do in the bedroom, because, gross.
* Tried to tell me once that I could sing very high. - Mom, I sang tenor from middle school all the way through college (including auditioned choirs). You have zero musical talent, you have no idea what you're talking about.
* She's one of the fun people who likes to make plans in her head, not tell anyone about them, and then get mad at everyone when they don't happen. - There's one instance in particular I can recall to about this, perhaps I'll make another post on that.
* She'll get mad at you if you don't include her in any plans that happen. - Brother and SIL came to OH and I's town for a concert we were all going to. Mom was upset that she wasn't invited. 
* On the above point, she always wants to be the ""cool"" mom and go out to bars or concerts or whatever with us. I don't mind having a drink with her, but not every time! Sometimes my brother and I just want to hang out with each other. We're allowed to have that relationship.
* Expected us to pay for her meals or activities if we went out somewhere. - Admittedly this has gotten better in recent months, but I'll get to her financial situation in a bit.
* Refuses to learn new skills or work other jobs with low skill entry. - She's been working a job that has been steadily in decline due to technology. It just doesn't pay well anymore. She says she hates working with people and pretty much refuses to seek other employment.
* The above caused her to move back to our hometown and move in with my brother, SIL, and their children. - She was there for far too long. Brother and SIL are saints for putting up with her nonsense.
* She moved into government subsidized housing. - While this isn't necessarily a bad thing and arguably the best thing she ever did for herself in this stage of her life, it's still annoying because she's still working the same job that pays her crap and still refuses to find other employment.
* Even though she's on government subsidized housing, she refuses to go on food stamps because she's too proud. - You could use any little amount of money saved to pay off things! I won't bemoan anyone who takes food stamps, they're there to help people out when they need them.
* Before all of this housing nonsense she had me pay our cell phone bill (that she set up for us when I first got to college) for about 6 months when I first got my job out of college. - Now my brother pays it (they justify it as her payment for helping with the kids so much).
* While I was still in college, and it would have been the summer of my Junior year (going into Senior) I received a couple of internships and was staying in my college town over summer. She got mad at me and said ""Well why did I get this big apartment for us then?"". - No congrats or that's awesome. Pretty much instant anger.
* She'll make various thinly veiled racist comments.
* This one is a bit petty on my part but on her most recent visit we had taco pizza for dinner (it was delicious) and she used a knife to spread some condiments, no biggie, but then PUTS THE DIRTY KNIFE STRAIGHT ON THE COUNTER. PUT IT IN THE SINK! We have approximately ZERO counter space! The sink is RIGHT THERE. Or if you're going to use it again put a paper towel under it or on the box or SOMETHING. Not on the bare counter! *huff*
* She'll get mad at you if you don't visit her if you're in her general area. - Basically if we're driving through (after going to see OH's family) and she finds out about it she'll get angry. Can't go through without visiting her even though we need to get home. I just don't tell her if we go anywhere.
* Complains about things even if she had no say in any planning and didn't pay anything. - Example: OH and I paid for her flight and hotel room to Vegas as she wanted to go for her 60th and we wanted to go so we thought we would be generous, the deal was that she would have to pay for anything else she wanted (couple times that didn't happen, my fault). Regardless, she would complain that we walked too fast. We weren't about to walk her pace to everything, we had things we wanted to do!
* She'll complain about something my brother or SIL did, is doing, or said to just about anyone who will listen.
* Will complain about brother's 3 kids when she has to take care of them, but will get mad when they find a different sitter for them.
* Will always say that she ""wasn't impressed"" with something. This could food, movies, whatever even though that thing was actually pretty good.
* Falls asleep at early times when we are all together. We usually try to see how early she'll fall asleep in the chair during Christmas get togethers.
* Usually critical of other people and how they are or how they act.
* And, of course, the threatening or idea that she'll come live with us for some undetermined amount of time when baby comes. - No, just no. I barely want anyone in our house to ""help"" when baby comes, I'll be stressed enough. Bonus: She still hasn't talked to me about this.

Sorry, this ended up being super long and I think that about covers a good bit of her nonsense. There's more, of course, but I don't want to make things too long haha. I should say, most of the time she's pretty ok. I call her about once a week because I don't want her to feel lonely and I usually enjoy our conversations. Having about a 3 hour buffer between her and us, though, has helped immensely. I'm sure it would be different if we still lived in my hometown.

Anywho, I hope you've enjoyed this mishmash of anecdotes. I hope the llamas are fed (did I say this right?). 

Till next time!

It's made me antisocial because I hate talking to people about what I'm doing with these days. I either have to make up some bullshit about freelancing or listen to their shitty advice I heard twice this month. I'm tired of being a shut in. I'm sick of getting dolled up for an interview for a job that's planned to go to an immigrant or someone's nephew.

The worst part is it makes me hate myself more than I already hated myself. It sucks moving in with my parents after five years of living alone. It's devastating to my self worth that even with my degree, my extracurriculars and my internships I'm still worth nothing to employers. I don't know what this world wants from me. I gave up my dreams of acting and writing because I thought computer science would get me a job and a good life. I was told to go to school when I didn't want to, yet none of my hard work and sacrifices have paid off in the slightest.

I just want to be happy. I don't care about money or power or having a special title. I just want to be content with who I am and with my life. I don't know what's more fucked up; me or this system."
8nco1p,2,2018-05-30,USC vs UC Berkeley for student veteran,studentvetthrowaway,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/8nco1p/usc_vs_uc_berkeley_for_student_veteran/,"Hello Reddit,

I’m a student veteran transferring from a CC and I’ve been accepted to both USC (University of Southern California) and UC Berkeley for electrical engineering. I have the full GI Bill, so costs are fully paid for either school I go to.

The way I see it, I’ll be happier at USC since I’m from the LA area. Additionally, their classes let me go straight into electrical engineering courses, where Berkeley requires a year of CS classes, which feels like it pushes me towards more software engineering than electrical engineering. The alumni network also sounds like a good deal, since I plan to stay near LA and work immediately after obtaining my degree. I would like to work in the defense industry as well, which seems to have a larger presence in SoCal, so it would be easier to intern at one of these companies from USC.

However, UC Berkeley is currently rated top 10 for electrical engineering no matter which list you look at and that kind of reputation is a big deal. I feel like I have the right discipline to get through the rigor at Berkeley, but it sounds like it will suck. Additionally, I plan on working on a master’s degree while working and going to Berkeley will probably set me up for success on this path.

Thanks!

1-How regularly should documentation be done, should It be like a daily report (written on a daily basis) where each change done that day is recorded.

2-What to do with highly uncooperative clients or ones that are being absurd.

3-when should I give up on finding the solution to a problem on my own and ask a superior?

4-If you are given a large task to do with uncooperative/lazy/unwilling partners do you shoulder all the work on your own are do something else? What to do when it all falls down despite your best efforts?

5-What are tickets, how does the ticketing system work?

But I can’t decide what’s most important when comparing graduate programs.  My goal has always been Big 4, but would be happy in industry. However, corporate and large firm recruiting is still very important to me. 

Here’s my background in case that influences your decision. 
I have my BBA in accounting, 3.8 GPA, and 3 accounting internships with heavy experience in tax. Would have applied to better schools but scored horribly on GMAT and didn’t want to throw money at prep classes. Also this is completely being financed independently by loans and a maybe 5k in grants. 

TLDR 
Are recruitment and ideal school location worth it for more than double the program cost? 

UT Dallas: MS 36 hours (1.5-2 yr completion), 36k+, all the Big 4 &amp; corporate recruiters, where I want to live,  harder program  

TAMU-CC: MACC 30 hours (accelerated, 1 year) 14k+, small town, zero recruiting presence, easier classes (greater chance of high gpa)

I’m from Denmark, and I am in a very lucky position, of being in the Philippines, working an internship at an Elementary School.
I want to improve and better my skills as a social worker. 
In Denmark I had the experience of working with refugee kids from Syria. Kids who have been on month long journeys from their native country to their current home.
I have witnessed first hand, the injuries and trauma that these children suffered. 

My goal in the Philippines is to better understand what they are going trough. How it feels to be in a new and diffrent culture, diffrent language.

I was supposed to be one of four bestmen at my best friend Nicklas
wedding in august. I realized how much I actually want to attend
the wedding. He is the first guy of a very tightknit group of friends that is getting married.

People I work with convinced me to give it a shot -surprise Nicklas at the alter in the church. 

For that to happen I need your help to buy a planeticket so I can attend the wedding.

I started lifting when I was 21 and did stronglifts -&gt; Wendler's 5/3/1 BBB -&gt; now started at a new gym with reddit ppl. Since the past two years have been unstable (study abroad, internships, graduation, new job), my workouts are not as consistent as I would have wanted in a perfect world but generally when I have a routine set I never miss it. Basically, it's been periods of religious, disciplined attendance with long breaks mixed in as my life changes. My weight's changed a lot but I'm still skinny fat and don't lift nearly as much as I'd have hoped by this point.

My new gym offers free PT sessions every six weeks, so I just had mine. We started by doing cardio to warm up, which I never do because it's boring and I don't want to spend the 10-15 minutes. We then did ""functional exercises"", basically kettlebell swings, Turkish getup, and a bunch of other things I don't remember (it's in a file I'll get tomorrow). We worked a lot on mobility and form and he said these exercises would help burn fat which is what I'm trying to do and would help with the PPL stuff.

Basically I'm thinking the following:
Monday: 5 minute jump rope/bike, then chest, 20 minute swim
Tuesday: 20 minute HIIT jumprope, functional/mobility exercises, arms
Wednesday: 5 minute cardio warmup, legs, shoulders
Thursday: 20 minute HIIT, functional/mobility, abs
Friday: 5 minute cardio warmup, back, 20 minute swim
Saturday: 5 minute cardio warmup, functional, legs

This way I'm squatting 2x a week, deadlifting once (could fit another on Wednesday), and bench pressing once. It's a lot less than I was doing with any of the previous workouts, but they haven't worked for me and it's been two years."

For any new readers, here’s a quick summary:  

&gt;Be Gog, red-skinned lizardfolk champion  

&gt;Chaotic evil, loves to bite stuff, loves to eat stuff, also loves killin stuff  

&gt;Hails from a swamp in the middle of nowhere, elected as tribe’s tribute to the dragon queen, Tiamat  

&gt;shewillrise.jpeg  

&gt;sent to a training camp in a far-off town to await further orders  

&gt;gets assigned a kobold intern  

&gt;put into a party of 5 (1 goblin, 1 kenku, 2 tielfings and Gog, plus kobold slaves)  

&gt;party sets out to a neighbouring town, destroying everything in their path by mutilating bodies, ransacking the main temple, and defiling everything else in between  

&gt;in the last installment, Gog just walked in on something he shouldn’t have walked in on  

&gt;rejoined his partymates through a portal  

&gt;tried to create a fire at portal entrance to deter anyone following him through  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
~~~~~~~~~~~~  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

&gt;unicorn tapestry burns unceremoniously, sputters out in a few seconds  

&gt;….  

&gt;thatwasmymasterplan.jpeg  

&gt;Gog’s face when  

&gt;Kenku runs/waddles behind the portal, hoping to gain an advantageous position  

&gt;Buckles the goblin backs up, side-eyeing for cover but can’t find any   

&gt;2 tieflings separate  

&gt;male tiefling prepares a spell, female tiefling orders her kobold to go to the portal entrance and wait while she turns into a bear   

&gt;Gog is the furthest one from the portal, still trying to act like nothing is wrong, despite his wide-eyed ‘wtf’ facial expression  

&gt;looking around, Gog sees nothing but rolling hills and mountains in the distance, shimmering-rainbow-ripples in the sky  

&gt;if it weren’t for impending doom this place would be pretty nice  

&gt;Gog’s swamp is nicer, though  

&gt;Gog's thoughts interrupted as a hand axe flies through portal into last remaining kobold intern  

&gt;splits skull in half  

&gt;sleepwellmysweetprince.png  

&gt;druid bear roars and charges towards portal entrance as 5 paladins in heavy armor emerge  

&gt;druid is on a warpath, rips the face off of paladin one and then steps on his head, popping it like a grape  

&gt;Gog’s face when a perfectly good head is wasted  

&gt;fuckinbadassdruidsman.png  

&gt;druid attacks again, biting paladin two in the stomach and whipping her head around like she’s a dyke going to town on her military wife who just returned home after 3 years of service  

&gt;paladin two ragdolls but isn’t dying, just extremely uncomfortable  

&gt;black bolt of energy comes out of no where, hits the holy-chewtoy  

&gt;he explodes  

&gt;male tiefling looks smug for a moment, until he realizes that could have gone very, very badly if he hit the bear  

&gt;raging female druid tiefling bear lesbian-impressionist doesn’t notice, swipes at third paladin  

&gt;fourth paladin goes to slash bear-bitch, does minimal damage, hears the screams of an old man and a young boy from behind him  

&gt;kenkuwantstoplay.jpeg  

&gt;backstab crit, paladin looks like he’s gone insane as he bleeds out on the ground, staring up at his murderer  

&gt;kenku staring back at him while the sounds of an old man and a young boy continue to scream out of its beak  

&gt;wtfishappening.png  

&gt;kenku super proud of his continued success regarding social-integration  

&gt;Ishouldwriteabook.jpeg  

&gt;Buckles is nowhere to be seen, most paladins dead or soon-to-be  

&gt;Gog’s time to shine  

&gt;he wasn’t hiding, he was biding his time  

&gt;trips as he charges, only manages to land a basic attack on the fifth paladin, while bear bitch continues to swipe at and inevitably shred the third paladin  

&gt;third paladin is a bloody mist, fifth paladin follows suite as bear bitch continues her rampage  

&gt;bear bitch is practically a woodchipper for bodies at this point  

&gt;2 more pally’s come through the portal  

&gt;comeondown.wheeloffortune.mp3  

&gt;1 is just another grunt, but the last one means business, has crazy plate armour, war hammer  

&gt;big boss Peter Paladin nails Gog in the head with his warhammer, Gog retaliates with a bite and a warpick swing  

&gt;both start crackin on each other with considerable strength  

&gt;kenku watches in awe  

&gt;male tiefling does the same from a distance  

&gt;druid is occupying herself with paladin grunt number six, almost finished  

&gt;took some damage and needs to rest but generally unharmed  

&gt;druidsareop.png  

&gt;Gog is hurting and taking damage but so is big boss man, pretty epic fight going on  

&gt;kenku tries to step in but takes a backswung-hammer to the head, squirrels away with 1hp  

&gt;male tiefling doesn’t want to risk another eldritch bolt   

&gt;buckles appears out of nowhere with a crossbow bolt to the paladin’s throat  

&gt;Igot’em!.mp3  

&gt;Gog upset that he was interrupted, insists he coulda handled it  

&gt;bitching at the party as he cuts off head paladin’s head  

&gt;portal doorstep littered with a few bodies, lots of miscellaneous parts, a lot of blood spray and intestinal confetti  

&gt;male tiefling about to cuss Gog out for starting this whole mess, strides up to him with his finger pointed right at the red lizardfolk  

&gt;GIGANTICSONICBOOM.MP9  

&gt;strange, multi-layered voice crackling through party’s heads like gaseous lightning  

&gt;WHO ARE YOU, WHO DARE TO DESECRATE *MY* FOLLOWERS IN *MY* REALM? WHAT VILE PROCESS DEEMED YOUR DISGRACEFUL PRESENCE WORTHY OF ENTERING THESE LANDS?  

&gt;volatile verbal plasma in psionic form strikes fear into their entire essence  

&gt;the background rainbow-radiation-ripples begin to coalesce, then turn into a tornado which touches down on the ground as gently as a feather but results in an explosion of all wavelengths of light, visible, non-visible, and everything in between  

&gt;suddenly, elephant-sized, shimmering white unicorn appears, mane is a cosmic rainbow of viscous fluid churning and gushing and flowing and pouring around her neck and flank  

&gt;party is literally stunned, kenku craps a white splotch onto his ankles, doesn’t even notice  

&gt;IhaveseenthefaceofGod.mp4  

&gt;Gog panics, never seen a horn horse before except for on that kindling he used earlier in front of the portal  

&gt;swings warpick at unicorn’s head while also shitting himself  

&gt;auto-defense-response.exe  

&gt;Giant horn-horse impales him with her human-length horn, tosses him in the air and boots him with her hind legs, imploding his skull  

&gt;1hp, somehow not dead  

&gt;Gog, laying on ground, witnessing his partymates groveling around the stupid colour horn horse, murmurs out a ‘I hate horn horses.mp3’  

&gt;slips into unconsciousness, all senses dulling, but the same voice from before remains

&gt;it is crisp, it is clear, and it is somehow gentle and soothing, like a mud pit over a geo-thermal vent, bubbling and steaming in the humid, swamp air, as mosquitoes buzz around its surface  

&gt;”Why do you hate me?""  

&gt;darkness

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

TLDR; I waited 3 weeks for my boyfriend to come back from his home country, only for him to accuse me of cheating. He now claims he was seeing other women in his home country. What do I do? 


Two days before he returned, he saw my snapchat story. I was posting picture of me and my male friend smoking hookah, going out to eat, and called him ""the best mofo"". To this, my boyfriend responded with: ""Are you f**king him? Disgusting."" We had a small fight. I never cheated on him, and remained faithful to him. 


I have many guy friends and I regularly go out to dinner with them. My university is 70% male, so it makes sense that I have many guy friends. To me it's just a fun and friendly time. 


My boyfriend was angry and I kept trying to tell him that all of my friends know about him, that my guy friend knows about him, and that I miss him so much that I cry at night. Eventually he stopped responding, and I attempted to call him and he told me he was eating dinner with his family and couldn't talk. I sent him a paragraph about how much I like him and how much I miss him, and that I was waiting for him faithfully. He eventually said we were okay. 


The next day, we had another fight. He told me he never had feelings for me and that I was only casual for him. He asked me how could I expect a serious relationship out of him when he doesn't know what will happen in his future. Before, he had messaged me often with caring texts. He promised he would see me when he returned, saying we would hang out together, spend quality time together, cook together, sleep over, etc... I thought this had meant our relationship was taking a step forward. I clung onto this thought for all three weeks, hoping it would be real.


I poured out all my feelings to him. I told him I had fallen for him. But then he told me he felt nothing for me. He was responding to my texts quickly, leaving it up to me if I wanted to be casual. I didn't respond. The next day when he came back, I asked him if he came over all right. His responses were quick, disinterested. That night I posted more pictures of my friend and I, and I posted messages of another guy flirting with me on snapchat. I was livid at my boyfriend. I realize it was immature, but I wanted something--some response. I was hurting so much I couldn't sleep all night. 


The day after he came back, I saw him. He saw me going to my friend's room at university. I was in there briefly, and then my friend and I went to eat. I saw my boyfriend leave the dorm with his friends, and I was angry. Hadn't he promised to see me? He wasn't investing time in me. I began messaging him if his promises were lies. I asked him if his previous care was fake. 


He told me how many times do I have to tell you I care about you? (This is different from him saying he has no feelings for me.) We texted back and forth, and he said if I didn't stop being angry then we should stop talking. I calmed down and he said he had no more time to see me. He couldn't always text me or call me. He didn't know how I define care, and so I defined it to him as being good to me, only wanting to show me good things, and not wanting to hurt me. And then he said he cares about me. He checked up on me later, asking me where I was. I told him I was having dinner with my friend and would be coming back to university soon.


When I came back I texted my boyfriend (should I keep calling him that?). He told me at first he was too jetlagged to see me. Later, he told me he was smoking outside of the dorms, implying that I should go see him.


We talked normally at first. I vented to him about my family, and he vented to me about the stress surrounding his internship, needing to find a job, and studying for the gre. We had a wonderful time talking. All at once he began saying how he didn't like my friend, how he always had a bad feeling about him. They used to be smoking buddies, actually. 


He went on like this for a while, until I steered the conversation away. We went to buy some whiskey and came back to the university. Very slightly tipsy, we started talking and laughing some more and actually we slept together. It lasted two seconds, and he was angry at himself. 


He told me he felt weird. He said he slept with girls in his home country and he lasted for hours there. How could he last with me only a few seconds? I felt hurt. 


I couldn't believe that when he accused me of cheating, that he had also slept with someone else. I remained faithful to him. 


What's worse is that it was unprotected, and I asked if the girl had STDs and he said no. I'm not sure if this is really the case. I'm not sure if he actually slept with someone else. I told him I had remained faithful to him and then he asked why didn't I sleep with my friend? I told him there was no attraction to my friend. He made a promise to see me when he returned, so I waited patiently for him.


Now he's asking me why don't I sleep with other guys. He's saying I'm too tight, that he can't hold it in. He says I'm the best he's had, but also he says that I should loosen it by sleeping with other guys. These are the most hurtful words. I only want him. I only love him. He began saying that he slept with 52 girls in his life, and never had he experienced this before. He began saying that none of this made sense. 


What should I do? Do you think he really cheated on me? I feel so lost. I love this man, but I don't know what to believe anymore."

TLDR; I waited 3 weeks for my boyfriend to come back from his home country, only for him to accuse me of cheating. He now claims he was seeing other women in his home country. What do I do?

Two days before he returned, he saw my snapchat story. I was posting picture of me and my male friend smoking hookah, going out to eat, and called him ""the best mofo"". To this, my boyfriend responded with: ""Are you f**king him? Disgusting."" We had a small fight. I never cheated on him, and remained faithful to him.

I have many guy friends and I regularly go out to dinner with them. My university is 70% male, so it makes sense that I have many guy friends. To me it's just a fun and friendly time.

My boyfriend was angry and I kept trying to tell him that all of my friends know about him, that my guy friend knows about him, and that I miss him so much that I cry at night. Eventually he stopped responding, and I attempted to call him and he told me he was eating dinner with his family and couldn't talk.

As a hobbyist vaper, working in the vaping industry was something I've wanted to try for a while, and thanks to PHIX I was able to learn more about the industry. 

It was never meant to be a long\-term thing though.

I'll be attending law school this fall, and suddenly an internship at a law office basically fell into my lap. 

As of this week, I'm no longer an employee of Brewell MFG/PHIX Vapor.

I set up the new warranty system, and hopefully the people who come after me will be able to keep it going without me.

Thank you all for the kind messages and reviews! I'll still be here, but no longer as an employee of PHIX."
8ng7ra,29,2018-05-31,I'm close to losing everything I value but nobody knows,Throwaway34593847539,WeListenToYou,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeListenToYou/comments/8ng7ra/im_close_to_losing_everything_i_value_but_nobody/,"Hi everyone,
I've been a long-time lurker of this sub since its creation and I figured it might be my time to share.

As a bit of background, I'm a 22 year old guy who just graduated college in the US with a good degree from a good school with a respectable GPA.  I come from a upper-middle class, tight-knit, suburban family of mostly accountants, though I graduated with a degree in biochemistry.  My family is very loving, and will support me in anything that I choose to do, no matter what.  I'm rather shy and would surely consider myself an introvert, though my girlfriend (20, she still attends the same college I graduated from, where we met) of over a year is much the opposite.  I am writing tonight because of a conversation that transpired tonight between her and I over the phone.

I am one of the ~50% of people who graduate in my major without a job lined up, to the surprise of nobody.  I didn't have any internships over my years at school, and my class load for my last semester was so demanding that I had no extra time to apply to jobs.  In the meantime, I've been working as a delivery driver to pay bills.

So it all happened in one day: I graduated on the same day I turned 22, early in May.  I've been telling everyone, friends and family, except my girlfriend, the same thing since then - that I'm looking for a 'real' job and working just enough to pay the bills.  Sounds fine and dandy, right?  Well, it's 99% a lie.  I've actually applied for 2 jobs in the past 6 months.  My girlfriend is understandably pissed at me, and many of our conversations lead to her repeatedly reminding me about how unemployed I am.  It hurts.  It hurts me, which I can stand, but it hurts her more.  Today she cried while on the phone with me about my situation - or mostly, that I've been very lax on applying to jobs, and applying myself to my own life in general.  This is not the first time we have had this conversation.  So tonight she gave me an ultimatum: apply for real to 5 jobs a week and take it seriously, OR she will out me to my entire family on the 4th of July about how I've been lying to them for the past 6 months.  Beyond this length of time our relationship is in jeopardy.  I know a lot of people have a big problem with ultimatums in relationships, but I see her side on this one.  She is so *so* hard working, she will not have a deadbeat loser boyfriend.  I understand and accept this stance and its potential consequences.


I understand her attempt to motivate me.  But in reality I just feel worse and less motivated than before.  I'm objectively under-qualified for every job that I apply for.  There is no reason to hire me rather than someone else in the stack of applicants.  Even if I was hired, I feel that with my current state of mind I could never properly excel and thrive at my job, let alone an interview.  Keep in mind, I will probably have to apply for upwards of 60 jobs before I even get an interview.  All of these feelings seem to converge on general hopelessness. 


Throw in the fact that I have 35k college debt looming in 5 months, and it just all boils down into a pretty dark place for me.  I could lose my girlfriend, my friends, the respect of my family, and the $2k I currently have in the bank.  I'm about to lose everything, yet I don't feel motivated at all to actually do anything about it.  I just feel the same as I always have.  It just feels like Wednesday to me.

Does anyone here have any ideas as to how to dig myself out of this mess beyond the easy 'just do it' type things?  I know the right path seems easy and obvious, but to me it is the polar opposite.  Thanks for reading, I hope you have a great day.

8ngl2j,1,2018-05-31,M4F - Secret Celeb Romance,lost_in_vegas_17,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8ngl2j/m4f_secret_celeb_romance/,"Wanting to play the secret lover of a famously beautiful woman today, in a fairly vanilla/romantic roleplay. The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.
 
Open to either short or long-term scenes, so feel free to PM me anytime you see this.

**I am over 18 and am looking for roleplay partners who are over 18 as well for this fantasy roleplay**"
8ngmq1,0,2018-05-31,Fresh out of college: critique/comment on my NYC budget?,coentraoxz,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/8ngmq1/fresh_out_of_college_critiquecomment_on_my_nyc/,"SITUATION: Recent grad going intern---&gt;full time at a place I love. Been going to college and living in Manhattan for four years. Busted my ass as an intern while in college to get the job. Love the people and the work, but it's a high stress, high performance.

STATS:
Age: 22, single
Current savings: 3K
Location: Greenwich Village
Income: 51K base, 3-7K annual bonus, 2-4K side hustle. Total about ~58K
Debt: 0 (good scholarships)
401(k) match: 3% of base salary. I'll max this out.
Health insurance: Still on parents'
Rent: 1350/mo. Utilities, internet, etc all included
Groceries: 500/mo
Personal upkeep/appearance: 120/mo
Transit: 20/mo (walk to work)
Subscriptions: 40/mo
Phone: Paid for by employer
Therapist: 428/mo

Leftover: ~650/mo

COMMENTS/RATIONALE
- I low-balled my yearly take-home to 37K to calculate that final leftover/mo stat. Is this reasonably accurate? My side hustle is as an independent contractor.
- I sublet in a 4BR/1BA in a very weirdly laid out apartment. That's why my rent is that low in Greenwich Village. It's very unlikely I'll move for the next year...I strangely like it, and the rent is great IMO
- I know the therapy is a luxury, but I've had alcohol and severe depression problems all throughout college, and have a great therapist. I've done horrible, ridiculously risky shit because of it. Staying stable mentally is critical to having a job like mine at all. I barely made it this far; I'm trying to make a change into sustainability.
- Personal upkeep includes monthly haircut, Walgreens stuff like shampoo, toothpaste, etc, cleaning supplies, misc necessities
- Groceries may seem low compared to other budgets I've seen, but I really don't feel squeezed there? Maybe my standards are lower? I also get a few meals per week free at work or client offices.
- Moving home to save is not an option. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have a job, no debt, and a halfway decent place to live in NYC (I'm from a flyover state).
- Mental health has been a challenge. I'm not looking to take over the world right now. I'm looking to survive my first year out of college, on my own, and just live for each day.

QUESTIONS:
- Is a 37K/yr take home pay estimate reasonable, given the above income stats?
- I plan to budget about 300/mo for fun discretionary spending, and put the rest in savings (~450/mo)...is this reasonable? [I'm not going to clubs or other stupid shit, I just want to  be able to go to a bar 1-2 times a week with friends or a date, or see a $15 show in the east village on a weekend night, and not have to sweat it.]
- Once I build an emergency savings of several thousand, how should I begin to invest the rest of my leftover income? (No stock option or anything like that at my job, just the 401K match)
- Is it worth it to meet with a financial adviser at this point? I don't have any financial role models/people I can really talk to who I trust on this.
- The therapy is a big expense, and I'm low-balling it too. IDK yet what it'll cost exactly, but it could be more. Even if I've been having serious issues, is this too much money? [services are biweekly individual sessions and weekly group sessions]
- Overall, what do you think? I am very open to comments! Thank you all!"
8nguyh,0,2018-05-31,Calling all CS majors,UBCTAW,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/8nguyh/calling_all_cs_majors/,"first off, congrats to everyone who got into CS! it was a hard journey but we made it guys :)

alright now for my question:
although I've been overjoyed the whole day, i can't help but think about internships now. unlike most who got in this year, my cumulative average was on the low side: 77% to be exact (85 in the first term and 70 in 2nd term due to a very close family member suffering a stroke). 
so, for all upper year cs majors: 
1)does a very low GPA hurt your chances of getting an internship? 
2) besides focussing on my GPA, what should I do to make myself a more attractive candidate going into the second year, in spite of this setback?

thanks for your help!"

I'm a recent permanent resident and moved to Canada after completing my Bachelors in the US. It's been 4 months since I have been looking for work anywhere in Vancouver greater area \(I currently live in Calgary where the job market seems even worse\). Co\-ops seem ideal for someone in my position but as a grad, I am no longer eligible. And without Canadian co\-op experience, or local professional networks, I am stuck. I have submitted more than 300 applications so far, been interviewed for 3 positions, but each was given to a more qualified candidate. I have had my resumé and cover letters reviewed by different people but they don't seem to be the problem.

I'm interested in anything entry\-level in software or web development, digital marketing \(SEO/SEM\), media management, UX/UI. 

I have 3.5 years experience in Communication and Digital Marketing, 1 year in Web Development and SEO, 3 years in Graphic Design. Software Development is mostly academic experience \(with one summer internship\). I have a cumulative GPA above 3.5 from an academically reputed American school, and two decent summer internships. I am not particular about salary as long as I can sustain myself financially. Willing to move practically anywhere.

How do I get my foot in the door? People have suggested I lie on my resumé but I refuse to do that. I also don't feel comfortable pestering employers by calling or sending follow\-up emails, but I might be wrong. Since I'm located in Calgary I cannot attend networking events or job fairs. But I do desperately want to get into the industry and am wondering if I'm missing something.Any/all advice would be immensely appreciated.

Thank you!

Tldr; new permanent resident, need advice on how to land entry\-level tech\-related jobs."

We were together for over three years.. we met when I was an intern and you were a Junior exec. I have worked my way up to the Junior PR Director whilst you are a Senior Exec. Everything was good, well so I thought, until I found you fucking Laura - a Department Manager in our bed. 
A pretty hostile environment at work for us.

I drive over to what was our house and where you’re still living to collect some of my stuff. Getting out of my car, emotionally drained I ask you “Has she moved in yet then?”

**On Set Antics**
Not thought this one fully through.

We work on a TV show, one of those that you see on Netflix - lots of drama.
It could either be:
* as actors we can’t stand each other but our characters are intimate
* Our characters hate each other but off set we are sleeping together.
* Rehearsing the logistics of a sex scene.

**Festival Fun**
Something about meeting at a music festival.
* Have we come along together?
* Do we know each other?
* Where do we fuck? *Tent?* *near the main stage?*


**Work place fun**
We work together. Outwardly we might not get on but we are sneaking around. Finding moments to hook up. Sending suggestive emails to eachother right under everyone’s noses.

**My character**
Let’s call her Kate
5ft, long dark brown hair, brown eyes, slim, toned ass

**Kinks**: rough sex, buildup, male dom, non con/dub con, teasing, risk, clothed, light bondage

**Limits**: blood, toilet, incest, animals, anything unrealistic

8nhfj8,1,2018-05-31,Benefits of Having your Brands on Social Media,placementpaagc,u_placementpaagc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_placementpaagc/comments/8nhfj8/benefits_of_having_your_brands_on_social_media/,"A brand is a product, service on concept that is publicly distinguished from other products, services or concepts so that it can be easily communicated and usually marketed, a brand name is the name of the distinctive product, service, or concept. Branding is the process of creating and disseminating the brand name. Branding can be applied to the entire corporate identity as well as to individual product and service names.
Establish your voice online and deliver consistent communication. When done right, online presence can help you establish a credible brand image, spread awareness about the product/service you are selling.
Social Media itself is a catch all term for sites that may provide radically different social actions. For instance, Twitter is a social site designed to let people share short messages updates with others. Facebook, in contrast is a full blown social networking site that allows for sharing updates, photos, joining events and a variety of other activities. 
Advantages of Using Social Media to Market your Business.
•	Increased Brand Awareness: Social Media is one of the most cost efficient digital marketing methods used to syndicate content and increase your business visibility. Implementing a social media strategy will greatly increase your brand recognition since you will be engaging with a broad audience of consumers.
•	More Inbound Traffic: Without marketing your business on social media, your inbound traffic is limited to your usual customers. The people familiar with your brand are likely searching for the same keywords you already rank for. Without utilizing social media as part of your marketing strategy, you’ll have much more difficulty reaching anyone outside of your loyal customer circle.
•	Improved Search Engine Rankings: Although posting on social Media might get your business some site traffic, more effort than that is required to see significant success. Search Engine Optimization is very important for achieving higher page rankings and obtaining traffic to your business website.  While social media doesn’t directly increase search engine rankings. Being able to rank in the top positions for your keywords will revolutionize your traffic and continue to generate positive results for your business.
•	Higher Conversion Rates: With increased visibility, your business gains more opportunities for conversion. Every blog post, image, video or comment may lead viewers to your company’s website and increase traffic. Social Media Marketing allows your business to give a positive impression through a humanization factor. When brands are interactive by sharing content, commenting and posting statuses on social media, it personifies a brand. People prefer to do business with other people rather than companies.
•	Better Customer Satisfaction: Social Media is a networking and communication platform. Creating a voice of your company through these platforms is important in humanizing your company. Customers appreciate knowing that when they post comments on your pages, they will receive a personalized response rather than an automated message. Being able to acknowledge each comment shows that you are attentive of your visitors needs and aim to provide the best experience.
•	Improved Brand Loyalty: One of the main goals of almost all businesses is developing a loyal customer base. Considering that customer satisfaction and brand loyalty typically go hand In hand, it is important to regularly engage with consumers and begin developing a bond with them. Social Media is not just limited to introducing your brand products and promotional campaigns. Customers see these platforms as a service channel where they can communicate directly with the business.
•	More Brand Authority: Customer Satisfaction and Brand loyalty both play a part in making your business more alternative, but it all comes down to communication. When consumers see your company posting on social media, especially replying to customers and posting on social media, especially replying to customers and posting original content, it makes you appear more credible. Regularly interacting with customers demonstrates that your business care about customer satisfaction, and is available to answer any questions that they might have. Satisfied customers are eager to spread the word about great product or service and they usually turn to social media will advertise your business and show new visitors your value and brand authority. Once you obtain a few value and brand authority. Once you obtain a few satisfied customers who are vocal about their positive purchase experience, you can let the advertising be done for you by actual customers who enjoyed your product or service.
•	Cost Effective: Social Media Marketing is possibly the most cost efficient part of an advertising strategy. Signing up and creating a profile is free for almost all social networking platforms, and any paid promotions you decide to invest in are a relatively low cost compared to other advantage because you can see a greater return on investment and retain a bigger budget for other marketing and business expenses.
•	Gain Marketplace Insights: One of the most valuable advantages of social media is marketplace insight. What better way to know the thoughts and needs of your consumers than by directly talking to them? By monitoring the activity on your profiles, you can see customer interests and opinions that you might not otherwise be aware of if your business didn’t have a social media presence.
•	Thought Leadership: Posting insightful and well written content on your social media is a great way to become an expert and leader in your field. There is no one way to become a thought leader- it requires work that can be supported by online marketing tools. To establish yourself as an expert, be sure to utilize social media platforms and build your presence. Be communicative, connect with your audience, share content, and promote your authority. When your social media campaign is aligned with other marketing efforts, your skills will be highlighted and follower will look up to your relationship that they will value, allowing you to become a notable influencer in your field.

8ni49o,11,2018-05-31,(Positive) update to post “Hospital social worker- overwhelmed”,forestfunky,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/8ni49o/positive_update_to_post_hospital_social_worker/,"You can view my previous post [right here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/8ghjcp/hospital_social_worker_overwhelmed/?st=JHUIMNKW&amp;sh=f7ff0b7d).

Happy new update to share: I received a call from the cancer center where I completed my Master’s internship (I applied at one of their locations close to my home). And the now director who was a fellow SW colleague at the time of my internship, remembered me and how well I worked. She asked me if I had my license- I said no but I successfully passed my exam and will have my license hours completed by mid September. Unfortunately she said the position was only for LCSW. A few weeks later, I received another call from the director and she asked me if she can talk to HR and have them approve interviewing me, if I would be interested. I almost said hell yes! So I went in for an interview and the very same day, just a few hours after my interview, I received a call from her and she said they wanted to continue with me for the hiring process!

I’m very excited because this is a cancer outpatient treatment center. Yes, I will have to do certain discharge planning tasks but I won’t have Management hovering over me and barking at me complaining about length of stay. Needless to say, this organization is very successful and has TONS of different facilities- university, Cancer center, hospitals, etc. I still can’t believe they picked me. When I was interning I could only dream of working there. I felt I established relationships with my patients and that’s something I haven’t been able to do at any of my jobs since I graduated. I also felt so close with the team- it’s a wonderful team of social workers and I had never seen such a great group working together to help patients. Even before my interview, my internship supervisor from the cancer center sent me an encouraging message and said they were all rooting for me.

Now comes a part I dislike- giving my notice at my current job. Do I go to HR first? Or my director? I don’t exactly trust my supervisors very much. I also can’t help but feel a tiny bit guilty because I know they will have a hard time without me. They’re short staffed as it is. And my coworker, ironically enough, messaged me yesterday to see how I’m feeling (Ive been out because I’m sick) and she told me “make sure to come back, we can’t afford to lose a good SW!” I have no idea if they suspect that I have found a new job or they know I’m unhappy. But this doesn’t help my nerves about giving my notice. 

I guess I don’t want them to think I’m ungrateful. I’m very grateful for the experiences I’ve had but they don’t treat me well and it’s not what I look for in terms of a long term career. It’s so difficult for me to face change and face the fact that some might not be happy for me and the changes I make- even if it might be to my benefit. It sounds silly but I just need to give my notice and get it over with.

I also worry about the new position but I feel if I have been at my current job for over a year- I feel I can do anything after the situations I’ve encountered there.

I also wanted to mention the pay at the new job isn’t exactly what I thought but I believe they might give me a raise once I get my license. I love social work but I’m always torn about the pay. I guess having a boyfriend that makes more than double what you make can kind of put these thoughts in your head. But I know social work is the field for me and I can’t always compare my salary to other fields.  I just feel I need to go for this job..take the leap and run with it. If it doesn’t go well, I can always move on and if it does..well, even better! I just am a bit worried about not being paid more once I get my license. I tried asking HR and she spoke to my director who couldn’t really give me an answer (I’m sure due to it all depending on the budget) but the HR personnel did tell me if I do right by her, I will be rewarded. 

Sorry this post is all over the place- so many thoughts racing!

Anyone have experience as an Oncology Social Worker? I kind of have an idea since I did my MSW practicum here but I’m curious to hear other experiences. "
8nibnn,1,2018-05-31,Antwoord op vragen van het lid Edgar Mulder over het bericht dat de BelastingTelefoon voor het zesde jaar op rij onder de maat presteert,kamerstukken-bot,kamerstukken,https://www.reddit.com/r/kamerstukken/comments/8nibnn/antwoord_op_vragen_van_het_lid_edgar_mulder_over/,"^(Beantwoording Kamervragen lid Mulder 2018Z05574  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft u kennisgenomen van het bericht dat de BelastingTelefoon voor inmiddels de zesde keer als onvoldoende wordt gekwalificeerd? Deelt u de mening dat dit volstrekt onacceptabel is?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. Ik heb kennisgenomen van de resultaten van het onderzoek van de Consumentenbond. Maatregelen om de beantwoording van vragen over wet- en regelgeving te verbeteren, zoals specialisatie op deze vragen en het versterken van de tweede lijn, worden voorbereid zoals ik u heb gemeld in mijn brief van 28 februari jl.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Vragen 2 en 3  
Hoeveel procent van de vragen zijn in minder dan 75% van de gevallen correct beantwoord? Hoeveel vragen zijn in minder dan de helft van de gevallen correct beantwoord? Hoeveel vragen zijn in minder dan 25% van de gevallen correct beantwoord? Hoeveel vragen zijn in geen enkel geval correct beantwoord?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke vragen worden het meest accuraat beantwoord &amp;#40;vragen over huurtoeslag/zorgtoeslag/kinderopvangtoeslag, ondernemersvragen &amp;#40;omzetbelasting of vennootschapsbelasting&amp;#41;, vragen van particulieren over de inkomstenbelasting of vragen van andere aard&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden vragen 2 en 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Belastingdienst beantwoordt per jaar tussen de 10 en 13 miljoen telefoontjes. Ongeveer 90% van de vragen die aan de Belastingtelefoon worden gesteld zijn zogenaamde proces- en statusvragen. De norm voor de kwaliteit van dit soort antwoorden is dat bij minimaal 90% juiste en volledige antwoorden worden gegeven. De realisatie in 2017 was 92%.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De overige circa 10% van de vragen betreft wet- en regelgevingvragen. Tot en met 2016 is er in opdracht van de Belastingdienst door een extern bureau onderzoek gedaan naar de kwaliteit van de antwoorden op wet- en regelgevingsvragen. De norm was 80%. In 2016 was de realisatie 86%. Daarbij beperkte het onderzoek zich wel tot de meest gestelde vragen. Deze meest gestelde wet- en regelgevingsvragen vertegenwoordigen ongeveer 7% van alle vragen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De beantwoording van de meest complexe en minder vaak gestelde vragen &amp;#40;3% van alle vragen&amp;#41; voldoet niet aan de genoemde norm van 80%. Dit blijkt ook uit eigen onderzoek in 2017, zoals gemeld in de 20e halfjaarsrapportage. De Consumentenbond bevestigt dit beeld. Daarmee komen de onderzoeksresultaten met elkaar overeen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De onderzoeken zijn zo opgezet dat ze representatief zijn voor alle belastingsoorten &amp;#40;burgers en ondernemingen&amp;#41; en Toeslagen. In deze onderzoeken is niet gekeken welke soorten wet- en regelgeving vragen goed respectievelijk minder goed worden beantwoord.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u van mening dat het huidige Nederlandse belastingstelsel zeer complex is en dat het voor burgers en het midden- en kleinbedrijf &amp;#40;MKB&amp;#41; essentieel is dat zij moeten kunnen vertrouwen op antwoorden van de Belastingdienst?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Burgers en bedrijven moeten kunnen vertrouwen op antwoorden van de Belastingdienst. Daarbij is het van belang dat zij hun eigen situatie en de juiste fiscale context voorleggen. Het hoort tot de taak van een medewerker van de Belastingdienst om vragen te stellen waarmee deze situatie en daarmee de fiscale context zo duidelijk mogelijk wordt, anders kan er al snel sprake zijn van onvolledige antwoorden of zelfs antwoorden die niet van toepassing zijn. Daarom heb ik ook in mijn brief van 28 februari jongstleden aangekondigd maatregelen voor te bereiden om de moeilijke inhoudelijke vragen beter te laten beantwoorden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vragen 5 en 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u het ermee eens dat gedegen kwaliteit van de BelastingTelefoon, voor burgers en het MKB het eerste aanspreekpunt van de Belastingdienst, van groot belang is en dat ontoereikende kwaliteit van medewerkers van de Belastingdienst de belastingmoraal in Nederland alsmede het vertrouwen van de burger in de overheid kan aantasten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u van mening dat het essentieel is dat medewerkers van de BelastingTelefoon in uitstekende mate inhoudelijk op de hoogte moeten zijn? Waarom is dat voor de zesde maal op rij niet het geval? Welke acties kunnen en moeten op korte termijn in gang gezet worden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden vragen 5 en 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Belastingtelefoon is ingericht om zoveel mogelijk vragen van burgers goed te beantwoorden, met behulp van gespreksondersteunende systemen. Medewerkers worden geworven op MBO werk- en denkniveau en worden intern inhoudelijk &amp;#40;bij&amp;#41;geschoold. Zoals in het antwoord op de vragen 2 en 3 is aangegeven, is de kwaliteit van de beantwoording van het overgrote deel van de vragen op orde. Het betreft proces- en statusvragen &amp;#40;90%&amp;#41; en de meest gestelde wet- en regelgevingsvragen &amp;#40;7%&amp;#41;. Ik herken dan ook niet dat er sprake zou zijn van ontoereikende kwaliteit van medewerkers van de Belastingtelefoon. Dat neemt niet weg dat ook de kwaliteit van de antwoorden op de resterende 3% van de vragen op een acceptabele norm moet komen, zoals ik ook heb aangekondigd in mijn brief van 28 februari jl.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe verklaart u dat de Belastingdienst op zijn vacaturepagina doorgaans geen vacatures plaatst voor inhoudelijke medewerkers voor de BelastingTelefoon? Hoeveel inhoudelijk geschoolde werknemers heeft u op korte termijn nodig om het probleem met de tekortschietende kwaliteit van de BelastingTelefoon structureel op te lossen? Hoeveel euro denkt u hiervoor nodig te hebben?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Circa 60% van de medewerkers bij de Belastingtelefoon wordt vooral binnen de Belastingdienst geworven, waarbij flexkrachten mee kunnen solliciteren. Voor de piekwerkzaamheden werft de Belastingtelefoon uitzendkrachten. Het betreft circa 40% van de capaciteit. Om ook voor de antwoorden op de genoemde 3% van de vragen bij het huidige aanbod op een acceptabele norm te komen, zijn meer fiscaal geschoolde medewerkers nodig.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Beschikt de Belastingdienst over interne opleidingstrajecten? Zo ja, welke cursussen worden aangeboden en door wie worden deze verzorgd? Hoeveel wordt hier jaarlijks van gebruik gemaakt? Is het succesvol doorlopen van inhoudelijke opleidingen standaardonderdeel van beoordelingsgesprekken bij de Belastingdienst? Is dat ook het geval bij medewerkers van de BelastingTelefoon? Zo nee, bent u bereid dit onderdeel van beleid te maken en strikt na te leven?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Medewerkers van de Belastingdienst maken met hun leidinggevende jaarlijks afspraken over te behalen resultaten en ontwikkeling van vaardigheden. Deze afspraken worden jaarlijks geëvalueerd waarbij door de leidinggevenden met behulp van een samenvattende conclusie een oordeel wordt gegeven over de mate waarin afspraken nagekomen zijn. Deze beoordelingssystematiek wordt rijksbreed toegepast onder de noemer Gesprekscyclus Rijk. Bijscholing vindt plaats als organisatieontwikkelingen of bijvoorbeeld wetswijzigingen daarom vragen. Daarvoor is via de Belastingdienstacademie een uitgebreide opleidingencatalogus beschikbaar.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Medewerkers die een functie hebben waarvoor specifieke aanvullende &amp;#40;fiscale&amp;#41; kennis en vaardigheden vereist zijn, worden gedurende hun aanstelling opgeleid door middel van verplichte startopleidingen. Dat betreft vaak modulair onderwijs. De modules worden zoveel mogelijk onder regie van de Belastingdienstacademie uitgevoerd, vaak met behulp van interne didactisch gecertificeerde trainers van de Belastingdienst. Dat aanbod wordt aangevuld met opleidingsaanbod van externe leveranciers zoals agressie- en weerbaarheidstrainingen. Medewerkers kunnen pas volledig op het takenpakket worden ingezet als ze de daarvoor benodigde startopleidingen hebben gevolgd. Afspraken hierover worden ook meegenomen in de Gesprekscyclus Rijk.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Dit geldt ook voor medewerkers van de Belastingtelefoon. Voordat medewerkers een bepaald type vragen van burgers en bedrijven gaan beantwoorden is de eis dat betreffende startopleidingen succesvol zijn afgerond. Bijscholing is afhankelijk van eventuele &amp;#40;wets&amp;#41;wijzigingen die zich in een bepaalde werkstroom voordoen. Niet alle wijzigingen vragen een aanvullende opleiding. Afhankelijk van de omvang kan volstaan worden met een instructie en/of een wijziging van de gespreksondersteuning voor de medewerker. Daarnaast zijn er maandelijkse kwaliteitsmetingen per medewerker en is kwaliteit een standaard onderwerp in de gesprekken tussen medewerker en leidinggevende.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vragen 9 en 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke garanties geeft u over het implementeren van beleid ter verbetering van de kwaliteit van de BelastingTelefoon?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft u kennisgenomen van het beleidsvoornemen van uw voorganger aangaande de kwaliteit van de BelastingTelefoon? Bent u van mening dat hij hierin voldoende is geslaagd? Zo ja, waarom? Zo nee, waarom niet en op welke punten heeft hij gefaald? Welke acties pakt u wel op en zet u op korte termijn in gang?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden vragen 9 en 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Verbeteringen worden ingevoerd na een zorgvuldig traject. Proeftuinen waarin mogelijke oplossingen eerst op kleine schaal worden getest maken daar onderdeel van uit. De Belastingtelefoon heeft inmiddels ervaring opgedaan met een proeftuin op het thema Nabestaanden en Schenken. Er is besloten het betreffende Serviceteam structureel in te bedden in de Belastingtelefoon, omdat onder meer de antwoorden op minder vaak voorkomende wet- en regelgeving vragen kwalitatief substantieel beter waren dan het gemiddelde van de Belastingtelefoon.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals ik in mijn brief van 28 februari heb aangekondigd, is in de afgelopen aangiftecampagne proef gedraaid met enkele thema’s zoals eigen woning en zorgkosten. De eerste resultaten daarvan zijn ook bemoedigend ten aanzien van de kwaliteit van antwoorden op wet- en regelgeving vragen. De door mij beoogde herinrichting is dan ook doorgaan op deze door mijn voorganger ingeslagen weg van specialisatie op basis van thema’s en het versterken van de tweede lijn bij vragen van burgers.)

8nitpp,3,2018-05-31,Vyvanse help!,SizzleyVelmate,adderall,https://www.reddit.com/r/adderall/comments/8nitpp/vyvanse_help/,"Hey everyone! So I was diagnosed two months ago with apparently severe ADHD, and I am a 22 yo female finishing up college. I started with Adderall 5mg, the 10mg and they helped for a day before I would build a tolerance to them. This is my third week of Vyvanse, we started with a week of 30mg, then a week of 40mg, and now I am on my second day of 50mg. So far I like most of the side effects, I’ve lost 20 pounds that I’ve needed to lose for awhile. It was in a relatively healthy way, I’ve managed to force my self to eat and exercise during this time. I’m currently taking two summer classes and working an intensive GIS-related internship, so the focus and energy of Vyvanse has increased my productivity by leaps and bounds. I love it!

HOWEVER;
My lack of sleep is killing me. I’ve always had issues with sleep, I would go through bouts of sleeping all day and then some weeks I would hardly sleep at all. Now, on vyvanse, the earliest I can EVER go to sleep is midnight. After 3 hours I wake up, can’t sleep for at least an hour, then I eventually pass out again. When my alarm goes off at 6 am, I NEED to be jumping up, running to the shower and getting ready for my day. However, I usually hit snooze until I’m late or have completely missed my classes without even thinking about it. I’ve tried forcing myself to take my pill as soon as my alarm goes off but I’ve been able to sleep for hours after taking it. 

I’m not sure what to do, I have plenty of energy and focus throughout the day but I can’t keep missing these classes! It’s like I’m not even HERE in the mornings when I hit the alarm. 

Any help is appreciated! "

DP, I'm a 24 year old woman that is finishing my first year in a career field after college. While in college, I met a guy on Tinder, and we hit it off \-\- not romantically, but as friends, and hung out all the time. A year later, I got an internship in a remote village in Alaska. I moved away for 3 months, and when I got back, I started dating a different guy. Said friend got a job elsewhere in the country, so my boyfriend never really got to meet him. My friend calls me weekly and we text a lot, which bothers my boyfriend, as he feels threatened. I understand where he's coming from. He never got to meet my friend. But at the same time, I don't want to drop my friendship for the relationship. I don't feel that's fair. My friend has recently brought up the idea of me coming to visit for a few days, but I'm scared of what my boyfriend would say. I know he wouldn't want me to go, but honestly, this is one of my closest friends, and with my stressful work situation I could reallllly use a vacation. Help! I'm stuck in the middle and don't want to hurt anyone.

Podcast LW2: A confused asexual

DP, I'm a 30 year old man, and I'm questioning whether I'm asexual. I've never really been into sex, as it creeps me out a little, and I've only ever had one sexual partner. I was also sexually assaulted in college. I do enjoy makeout sessions and cuddling, just not sex. My problem is that I've started dating someone, and I'm trying to figure out how and when to tell her that sex is not really my thing. I've told her that I have issues around sex, and about my assault \-\- we were friends before we started dating. And she's been very patient and trusting. How do I tell her that sex may not be an option?

Podcast LW3: Finding peace when you are ""undateable""

DP, I'm a middle\-aged woman with no experience in dating, relationships, or sex, due to a genetic condition that has left my appearance ""unfortunate."" I have always focused my energy on my studies work, friendship, and trying to help others. But the older I get, the more painful it becomes to be so profoundly alone, and romantically rejected in spite of my decent personality and strong social skills. Attempts at online dating have only earned me insults, and belittlement, and efforts to turn friendships with men into something more have always resulted in laughter, shock, or simply a firm no. The recent spate of media attention towards people who are unable to form romantic relationships has made things even harder for me. Increasingly I see older adult virgins and unloved people being stigmatized as potentially dangerous and branded ""entitled"" if we even admit to our feelings of loneliness, all because of incidents perpetrated by misogynistic men. Efforts to hide my grief and shame about my undesirability and inexperience ad yet another layer of pain. I've watched my normal\-looking peers marry and raise children with people who love them, and wondered why the universe deemed me unworthy of spending my life with someone else, especially when I've been able to look past the appearances and challenging circumstances of others, and hope that my affection might be returned. How do I find peace with my situation?

Podcast LW4: Not getting any better

DP, my stepfather set his dog on me when I was a child, and I was mauled to the bone. I still have the scars on my arms 30 years later. I've done therapy; I've done support groups. Dogs no longer send me into immediate panic attacks, but they make me uncomfortable at best. At worst, I can't breathe and I pass out. My fiancé's sister refuses to crate her dogs if we come over, and has surprised me twice with her untrained, jumping dogs. The last time her animals attacked me, I ended up having a panic attack and crying in the bathroom. My fiancé yelled at his sister and I overheard everything. She thought I should go back to therapy since it ""didn't fix me"" and I ""wasn't normal."" My fiancé called his sister a heartless betch and told his sisters we were not coming over if his sister was there. We left, and my fiancé has kept his word. It's gratifying to know that he's in my corner, but I still feel guilty that I am the reason there's a rift in the family. There is no magical button that is going to make me feel better. It's taken years for me to get where I am, and I honestly think this is the best I can do. What do I do here? I don't want to break up my in\-laws before the wedding even happens."
8njan2,43,2018-05-31,Park Guys are the Worst,folklife123,creepyencounters,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/8njan2/park_guys_are_the_worst/,"This happened over the course of at least a year and just kind of progressed from there. To me, this was the first encounter I've had like this (and hopefully the last). I actually have two different encounters from this, so bear with me. 

I started a new job in 2016 at a museum that just happened to be in a park. This was my first ""big girl"" job after finishing my degree and stepping out into the working world. It sounded like the best place to start working since I had some background in museum work through internships and the like and was just an all-around great working environment. Of course, with any job, it had its ups and downs. 

The park itself had a crew of about six to seven guys working at one time and they would be stationed around the park working and whatnot. As I was the new, young girl, the guys made themselves extra available when I was starting out. Whatever, I kind of enjoyed the attention. It was never anything too aggressive (at first) and mostly just friendly banter about myself and what I like, where I come from, etc. 

A few weeks go by and that's when the hugging started. I am not a touchy-feely person, but this job broke me out of that and I became more endearing when it came to certain people. Then ""Joe"" started coming around more and more often. 

Now Joe was a friendly guy, much like the other fellas, but his intentions were much more, let us say, unmistakable. I am definitely not naive, but I always try to tread carefully when I start to learn the background to certain folks. 

(I should back-up: this park/museum was located in the middle of bumfuck surrounded by the bumfuckery civilians.)

Joe had a background in crime. He had gone to prison for a number of years (as did most of the park crew) but his happened to be due to drug and alcohol abuse and for straight-up beating up/killing a few folks. Again, ok, but it was a culture shock I'm not used to and tried to avoid whatever interaction I had with the dude. 

Things started taking a turn when I came off as ""too friendly"". I would pull into the back of the building, and there waiting for me was Joe. ""Well, good morning gorgeous. I was just waiting for you before I pick up the trash (garbage bin was around the back of the building). It's so good to lay eyes on something so beautiful to start my day."" He goes in for a hug and that's pretty much it. I don't think much of it, until it starts happening every day. I would go up away from the building until I knew he was gone (because these guys are on a schedule to get the work finished in the park). He started actually hiding behind the trash bin to see when I would come in and just peak out. I guess he started to notice how I was driving past the building and stopped for a minute. I thought it was over after that. Mind you, this guy has a wife and three kids (one that's very close to my age). I got to my breaking point when he started kissing me on the head (literally side of my head with hair) then it seriously got disgusting when he decided to kiss my neck one day. I pushed him away and said ""I've got to get inside and unlock the building."" And he followed me in. I quickly got away from him, not caring if the door slammed in his face, unlocked the building and acted like I was on a call until my boss came in a little later. He meandered around and when he saw his own boss coming by, he got out of there fast. 

As soon as my boss came in, I told her what happened and she's the type of person that confronts another person face-to-face (thank God). She went directly to him later that day or the next and basically told him not to get too comfortable with me because I clearly wasn't having any of it. Looking back, I wish I had been more vocal about it, but it was a lesson that I just needed to learn from. He didn't come around as often after that.  After about a year and a half of working there, he was let go for ""unknown"" reasons, but I always heard that he would get high in the bathrooms in the park and do a lot of things that would get you fired in any other working situation. What he should have been fired over was sexual harassment and being straight-up creepy as hell. 

I'll go on with my next tale that happened around the same time as creepy guy Joe. 

Our next creepy guy is known as ""Gary"". Gary started coming to the museum long before I ever started working there. He had a wife at one time, and (as I come to find out from Gary himself) a girlfriend. Gary came off as a nice old man. In his mid to late 60s, even though he looked to be closer to his late 70s, around 5'5"", somewhat scrawny (someone I could take if need be) and had an indention in his head. 

Gary wanted someone to take care of him. ""What's your name?"" ""You got a boyfriend?"" (I answered yes every time he asked) ""How old are you?"" basic questions any old, lonely man would ask a young woman. Again, like the last encounter, he started asking these same questions every time he'd see me. At first, he would come into our office/lounge area and talk to all of us. After about the fifth time coming in and talking, he decided to set out front. See, we had this buzzer that would go off when someone came through the door. And like Pavlov's dog, one of would get up to see who came in. I was the one who would often get up (being a newbie and all) and see who it was. There was Gary, just sitting there one day. He pats the seat next to him and I go sit next to him and we chat for a while. 

""You know, I had a stroke and had to have brain surgery,"" he says, and continues to say for the remainder of conversations we had. Whatever, he's a bit loony, I can get along with this guy for however long. 

He soon becomes creepy Gary when he starts saying ""Man, if you were my woman, I'd never let you go. You should come visit me, you know where I live, right?"" 
""Sure Gary,"" I say. I sure as hell wasn't visiting this guy. 

The next time he comes in, he waits on me like last time. ""Why didn't you come by my house?"" he says. ""I got a little busy, Gary. I do work a lot."" He just brushes it off and it's pretty much the same questions again, but this time, he's a bit more agitated.  
""What's up with ya, Gary?"" I ask. ""Well, my woman left me. A man gets lonely, ya know? Is your boyfriend still working out for ya? But you can consider yourself to have TWO boyfriends!"" And I just look at him kind of confused and then it hits me. I get up and tell him I have to get back to work. 

I think a lot of folks would consider this like any other old man with a need for a companion. He definitely was not handicapped and he drove an incredibly nice truck. I got incredibly uncomfortable when he started visiting only on days when I worked alone. It was quite often, actually, due to illnesses and the like and there only being four employees at the museum. He made it clear by saying ""I only want to visit when you're here by yourself."" Sure, go ahead, make me that much more uncomfortable in my working space. 

Gary finally stopped coming around after we got laid off and the state stopped funding the museum. I was looking for a new job around the time, so it sure did not bother me at all. I got transferred to a new site and since then have not had any more creepy encounters from Gary's or Joe's."
8njbvu,5,2018-05-31,"[Mazzoni Center/Shanin Gros] [Philadelphia, PA] Informed consent medical provider",lupineland,TransRate,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransRate/comments/8njbvu/mazzoni_centershanin_gros_philadelphia_pa/,"OVERVIEW:
I chose to go through the informed consent model instead of paying for a therapist I couldn't afford to gain a letter for hormones. The Mazzoni Center in Philadelphia is a long-running center for LGBT-specific health care and HIV help/testing. They cater to lower-class individuals, especially those with poor healthcare or no healthcare at all. More information is on their website. They do a wonderful job of making you feel comfortable. Just being around an LGBT part of the city is awesome, really.

PROCESS TO GET ON HORMONES:

- Call in/schedule an appointment online thru their patient portal for trans care specifically. Your appointment will be a month or longer away.

- On your appointment day, you will have TWO appointments. One with a doctor for the medical side of HRT, and another with a social worker who wants to hear your experience with being trans, your support system, and background history.

- After these appointments, you will get bloodwork done. 

- Another appointment is scheduled to check on your bloodwork. MAKE SURE you also make a nurse appointment for self-injection teaching, if that's the route you're going.

- After checking on your bloodwork, if your doctor believes  you're ready, you'll start HRT! After being taught how to self-inject by a nurse, you head to the Walgreens downstairs to pick up your hormones! Make sure you set it up so the local Walgreens will give you hormones so you don't have to drive there every time. 

- You will have a scheduled check-up appointment a few months later. After that, the check-ups progressively get less frequent, unless you have an issue going on.

- This whole process of getting on hormones should take ~2-4 months, though the latter is pushing it. They're busy, but make this such a fast and smooth process.


MEDICAL PROVIDER: Shanin Gros is my medical provider at Mazzoni who goes over trans care with me. She is very comfortable to be around and is clearly experienced with not just trans people, but anyone on the sexuality spectrum as well. Her job is to cover the medical portion of transitioning, and check-up on how you're doing on hormones, etc. She's willing to go out of her way to help you and is very diverse in her views of LGBT people and their experiences.

SOCIAL WORKER: I had a random intern as my social worker, and they were very laid back, making it very easy to discuss otherwise difficult topics. However, they were clearly an intern and needed to focus on me rather than themself.


COMPLAINTS:

- Since the staff is so busy, there were some mistakes in my scheduling. For example, no one set up an appointment for me to learn how to self-inject, and the process of getting a nurse appointment was very tedious and I wound up having to go back a second time.

- The nurses have different ideas of how you should self-inject. My first nurse advised me the wrong areas and generally wrong techniques that made it more difficult to self-inject. Do your own research alongside this, please!! Communication about which type of HRT I was getting (intramuscular, subcutaneous, injections, gels, etc.) was also poor and I even got an intramuscular shot there when I was supposed to get subcutaneous, apparently."

Letter 1:

&gt;Q. Manager asking me to translate adult films: I’m an ex-military guy using the GI Bill to attend college. I’m looking to enter the tech field and landed a great internship at a well-known tech company. During introductions, I let people know that prior to entering college, I worked in military intelligence and had learned an East Asian language as part of my job. This attracted the interest of a senior project manager in my office who is also an ex-military linguist, but who had learned a different East Asian language. We struck up a conversation, and he revealed that he was working on a “side project” that could use my language skills. Being eager to impress, I readily volunteered, and he asked me to come over to his place that evening. However, when I arrived, I was mortified to learn that his “side project” was adding English subtitles to animated porn films for some website he runs! Not wanting to lose the internship, I awkwardly translated a few lines for him, then made up some excuse to leave. Now I have an email from him asking when I am free again to help! I worry if I say no, I’ll risk upsetting somebody who could potentially sabotage my career, but I also don’t want to spend my evenings translating tentacle porn and God knows what else for this weirdo! If I were a woman, I think this would be sexual harassment, but what the hell is this if you’re a guy?

Letter 2:

&gt;Q. Saddled into surrogacy: I was the surrogate for my twin sister after she was in a car accident that left her unable to have children. I was already married with three sons when she and her husband approached me. My husband and I agreed. I delivered my niece without any problems five years ago. I am currently pregnant with a little girl now. I was planning on having my tubes tied after this. When I told my sister and her husband this, they grew very upset. Apparently, they were counting on me to carry one more pregnancy for them. My twin even told me it wasn’t fair that I “get” four children and she “only gets the one.” It felt like a knife to the heart. I was completely blindsided. I haven’t even told my husband, because he will react with rage. I don’t know how to interact around my sister anymore. I have never had a child without her there holding my hand: She was there for my boys and there when I pushed her daughter into this world. Our mother died when we were teens. We’ve celebrated most of our major life milestones together. I feel completely alone. How do I deal with this?

Letter 3:

&gt;Q. Be-little-ing boyfriend: I have been dating “Dan” for four years. I am three inches taller than him, and I like to wear heels. It has always been an in-joke when we go out that people think he is rich because he has a hot blonde in heels on his arm. Six months ago, Dan got sick and was laid off at work. He is better now and has a new job, but the medicine he takes made him gain weight and he is making less money than he did before. I am very thankful, because we thought the disease was initially more serious than it turned out to be. Dan is still attractive to me. He has always been witty, and his sense of humor is what made me fall in love with him, but now it has gotten very prickly. Dan puts himself down all the time and jokes about me leaving him or trading him in for a better model. Nothing I can do or say reassures him. I have tried to be more affectionate and to initiate sex, but it does not seem to help.

&gt;Last week, we were going to a business function at my company where I was to be a featured speaker. I couldn’t find one of my high heels. Dan told me to just wear flats and I said no, I needed to wear them. Then Dan said that I liked to wear heels so I could look down at people—just like that, out of the blue. It hurt, and I told him so. Dan just walked out of the bedroom. We went to the event and came home not speaking to each other. Since then, Dan has made more cutting comments. He will not go to a counselor. I don’t know what I can do here. It is like I went to bed one night with the love of my life and woke up next to a stranger. Please help?

8njk17,1,2018-05-31,Here's a bit of feedback,xadine,dauntless,https://www.reddit.com/r/dauntless/comments/8njk17/heres_a_bit_of_feedback/,"Disclaimer: This is mostly for the devs but feel free to read it and it is REALLY long :\)  I'm not a native speaker and this is gonna be a long post so bear with me. What I'll talk about is based not only on my own game experience but my friends' too. Also I want to make it clear that I absolutely love this game and even though I may sound mean sometimes in this post I only wish for the game to succeed!

Now lets get to it!

Most of What I'm about to talk are QoL changes but a tiny point can make a huge difference as to how people react.

**Character creation**

*Good*

Enough items to make a unique character. I specially loved the ""chose your ancestors"" part, it is not something revolutionary but it is a nice touch \(we had a hard time understanding why we could select 2 men or 2 women as it can give any descendant, but then we took ""ancestors"" in a more broad way but it make lose a bit of its interest. Yes I know I'm being a bit peaky here\). The fact that we can select our eyes color individually is pretty cool too.

*Bad*

I said it in previous posts in previous beta stages, back then it was just a way to tell you ""you forgot THAT"". In open beta it has become a HUGE issue to me because it should have been fixed at this stage of the development. What am I talking about? 2 things:

1\)  there is no way of knowing wich item you have selected when you create your character. If you chose ""spiked hair"" \(or any item for that matter\) you can visualize it on your character but you have NO indications in the item list that you have selected ""spiked hair"". One of the best ""fix"" in my opinion would be to make the selected item bigger and place it on top of the list, or eventually put the item name on display above the character. I can understand it may require ""more work"" but the least you could do is to change the color of the selected item, go from a yellow\-ish bubble to a gray/brown one.

2\) When you change the ""size"" of an item \(jaw, nose, ...\) there is NO indication of the ""default"" value. The best ""fix"" would be a scale that range from 0 to 100 \(from smallest to biggest with 50 being the default\) that the player can toy with. But the least would be to have a MARKER at the ""default"" value.

*My feelings*

I know this seems to be ""details"" but it reflect badly on the team. Frankly my thoughts 2 beta stages ago were ""this is most likely the intern's job""... When you start a game and the very first impression is something ""unfinished"" it set you on a bad mood for the rest and will most likely negatively impact your experience.

**Tutorial fight**

*Good*

The tutorial itself works like a charm BUT could be better. It is way better than it use to be.

*Bad*

ALOT of players have no clue how you break parts or that the eather rift have 5 charges for the party and not per players. And I'm not talking about wound dmg and stagger... The tutorial would be a good place to explain it. Frankly part / stagger / wound dmg are not the most obvious things in the game.

*Bug*

If you bind your keys during the tutorial it crash once you killed the gnasher and you have to go again one more time through the character creation and the tutorial \(or at least it was the case on day 1\). Very frustrating

**Map**

*Good*

Damn it feels so good to be able to click the map! And the map is gorgeous too.

*Bad*

Why can't I click on the island I want to start the expedition? Why can't I see wich behe is on wich island unless I specifically look at the expedition window?

*Idea to improve the map*

Make it clickable all the way! Click on a ""tier"" \(like it is at the moment\), then make each island clickable and once you clicked on an island make appear 2 buttons ""expedition"" and ""hunt"". If we click the ""expedition"" it start the expedition on that island, if we click ""hunt"" let the player select the icon that correspond to the behe he wishes to hunt. Display wich behe is on wich island with a tiny icon or just keep the current expedition window but make it ""pop"" when you move your mouse onto an island instead of having to search for it. I can hear you ""but the patrols are suppose to be random"", just put a big ""patrol"" button under the island set you're currently looking at. The only ""change"" that it would create is for people that start a specific hunt to be able to chose the island on wich they'll hunt their behe but I don't see a reason why it'd be an issue. Also, display behe elements chart as a legend on the side of the map once you clicked the map \(but keep it working the way it currently does i.e. only if the players got the kill\).

**Hunt**

*Good*

It is quite easy and quick to find a party

*Bad*

When I  start an expedition I want to collect and not rush the behe because the guy that I was match with started a patrol. I'm under the impression that  the game match you with whoever started a hunt in your area no matter the ""game mode"" requested. It's fine to have a fast matchmaking but it's better to have people that actually want the same thing.

*Suggestion*

A In Game vocal chat would be great.

*Bug*

My friend in the UK is kicked off the game at the end of almost every hunts. I'm currently in CA and others party members are in FR and none of us have this issue. He send a ticket but I thought I put it here too just in case.

**Reputations**

*Good*

It is better than it use to be especially the weapon one.

*Bad*

I'm already 16 slayer / 7 weapon / 9 alchemy and so are everyone I play with... I was hoping for new reputations as I go forward but nop... I need my farm guys... It is a bit disappointing to complete it so fast and have nothing else to fight for, I mean this kind of game works because people want to farm for better items.

*Bug*

When I start a private hunt it doesn't count for the dailies. Tried it alone and with a party, expedition and patrol. Sometime when I have a daily ""kill XX"" and I get the kill it doesn't count, so I have to start a hunt on another ""tier"" to validate it. My friends and I checked the daily description to be sure but no indication of any ""tier"" required.

**Elements**

*Good*

Quests take time to ""explain"" people how Blaze can be of use

*Bad*

The elements are not well balanced. there's no reasons to pick a frost weapon \(except for the nayzaga\). Up to maelstrom \(prior to reza and storm, didn't tried them yet so can't say anything for them\) the slow isn't of any use. It doesn't deal dmg, and behemoths animations aren't fast enough to justify the need to freeze them. The fire deals some decent dmg but that's about it. The shock on another hand... damn this is so powerful. I play almost all the time with 2 friends, all 3 of us use shock weapons and you can perma CC behemoth this is just ridiculous. Sure you don't have the ""dmg"" part like blaze, but for the time the behemoth is shocked your party unleash hell on it and it's so much more dmg in the end.

I can't tell if you should nerf shock weapons or buff other elements but as it is right now, shock is WAY too strong in comparison to blaze and frost and frost is WAY to weak.

**Behemoths**

*Good*

Most of the behemoths are fun to fight and well balanced no matter the weapon you use.

*Bad*

Depending on your team weapons set some behemoths can be a bit... tedious. Try a skarn with only chainblades/swords/warpike... damn it is so boring. Drask with a hammer is my personal hell. I know you are suppose to adapt but without an In Game voice chat and the current legion of bugs in the airship it make it hard to have the proper comp in a PU group. Like I said, I play almost exclusively with friends, so we always have the ""proper"" comp but when I go without them damn it is frustrating.

*Personal feelings*

Some behemoths feel too alike. Gnasher is a mini Pangar wich itself is a nordic hellion. Storm is just an Ember on steroid and Nayza is a flat\-headed quillshot. As for shrike and skraev do I need to point it out?

The Drask is hell. I can't get used to its animations and for my friends feedback I'm not the only one. We avoid it as much as we can and it's always a pain in the ass to fight it.

Kahrabak is pretty frustrating too but not for the same reasons. Its always moving, hit you even when stun or shocked. We've only failed it once but every time we face it it seems more buggy than the previous fight. When we hunt it most of us swap to chainblades so we can keep on with him. We did several run with our regular comp but the interrupts where to unreliable and so was our dps. It is going way smoother with chainblades... Interesting fact: we have fewer issues with the Razorwings...

**Difficuly and progression**

*Good*

It feels pretty smooth to progress in this game. Maybe a little too much.

*Bad*

Most party hit a ""brick wall"" when they encounter the Drask and later the Stormclaw. Those behemoths are simply way stronger than they counterpart. I would suggest to buff a bit the others rather than nerf those 2 \(not talking about my personal hatred for drask\).

*Personnal feelings*

Me and my friends were very disapointed with Maelstrom behemoths. We farmed the leaving hell out of Hellion / Storm / Nayza / Pangar in order to get ready for the Maelstrom \(we red on reddit that behe there were really hard fights\) and when we started our first patrol... damn we were disapointed. We killed 3 of the behe on our first try and the Gnasher on our 2nd and we didn't use any potions \(aside the healing one\) for those fights. Nayza and Khara are barely harder than the previous ones and charrog is just too slow to be a threat. Only the Gnasher was a challenge to us, and after 4 runs it no longer is. We were expecting harder hunts, ""alot"" of new moves and for the behemoths to look more ""fresh"" than just a light change of color.

Maybe we'll get what we're looking for with Reza and Shrowd.

**Maelstrom weapons and armors**

*Good*

It's nice to have a buff of stats and ""new"" stuff

*Bad*

It is sad and disapointing that the ""new"" gear is EXACTLY the same skin as the ""old"" one. I get it, behe in the maelstrom are just variation of the ""normal"" behe but... are you kinding me! I'm not asking to create brand new assets, but you could add some twists to the ""normal"" sets so we can tell the ""new"" one isn't the same as the ""old"" one. For nayza just change the place of the spikes, for gnasher the amount of fur... you see where I'm going.

*Personal feelings*

I just don't see the point of introducing ""new"" behe / gear / weap if you're not going to make them feel ""new"". This is so far the most frustrating point in the game for me.

**My fears and expectations for this game**

*My fears*

My friends and I love this game. We really enjoy it a lot but we're scared that it may get boring quite fast in its current state. It's still in beta so it hard to tell if it's so limited because it is a real beta or if it is a ""last check before release but that's the full game"" situation. I know more content will come later but I'm scared that the game we have to play now is the full game. If it is the full game, then it lack content... like A LOT. Need more behe with a unique feeling \(gnasher/pangar/hellion is only 1 mob, quillshot/nayza 1 other, ember/storm...\), need more stats combination/customization, need more challenge, need more weapons...

As it is right now the game won't last. People will get bored pretty fast because once you've killed the same behemoth 20times, full armor/weapon what next?

*My hopes*

I'm pretty sure the dev team is aware of that. I know you're working on new kind of weapons and new behemoths. And I'm pretty sure you have plans to expend the game horizons.

*My ideas*

The obvious one, more weapons / behemoths / islands.

Could be great to have a ""real"" patrol. Put 4 players in an airship with the capacity to move the airship through the maelstrom and chose wich island they want to land on. Make it possible to see what type of behe is on the island but not wich one exactly \(like frostback pangar, regular pangar, alpha pangar...\).

Would be amazing to have Raid\-like version of the behe. something that require more slayers to handle but with different behaviour than regular behe. I mean a bigger island \(like way bigger\) with rogue\-like version of behe on it and after you killed them all \(or enough of them if they respawn/ too many of them\) the ""king"" type appear in the middle of the island. Maybe even give it the ability to summon rogues... Ofc the challenge would be to make it not too long to be boring but not to easy to spoil all the fun. The only big issue I see with this is the ""danger"" meter...

New kind of reputation would be great too. I know that I'm on this kind of game for the farm and I'm not the only one. I need something to grind for, reputation, loot, glory... but I need something.

**THANKS FOR THIS AWESOME GAME AND I HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL TO THE DEVS.**

Thanks you for reading it 'till the end you're the real MVP :\)"

I was accepted into both U of T’s and Queen’s MPP/MPA program, and I’m having a hard time deciding. 

If I choose U of T the price tag will be around $33,000 over the 2 years... which is a lot, and Id have to live at home. Queen’s would be around $25,000 factoring in living expenses, and it’s 10 month program.

Can anyone speak to their experience in either program? In time I want to work at the federal level. I’m hesitant about U of T because of the timing of the internship (i.e, I can’t get hired back because of having to go back to school in the fall). On the other hand I’m under the impression it has more brand recognition (though I could be wrong).

8nkidg,9,2018-05-31,Rocket League if full of half-baked ideas,Cuse473,RocketLeague,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/8nkidg/rocket_league_if_full_of_halfbaked_ideas/,"I love this game, but it seems like a trend that pysonix introduces a feature that is only half of it's available potential and then never patches it again. I think part of the problem is that they only do massive patches instead of bi\-weekly QoL patches, but that is another whole issue. Let me give some examples.

Season Mode: I started playing this game a few months after release, so I don't know what it feels like to be a new player, but I imagine that immediately hopping into ranked would result in you getting destroyed constantly and it is well\-known that the unranked in this game is atrocious, which is another issue that they seem reluctant to solve. So it would be nice for new players to have a mode like season to learn the game, but it hasn't been touched since I played it in August 2015. You can't customize your car, because you have to be the colours of the team you pick. If bots get the double straight kick\-off, they both go and neither of them hit it resulting in a free goal every time \(seriously, how hard can this one be to fix? Honestly seems like an intern could do\). Other than the standings there are no stats or anything to look at. Like just add some fresh, new fun features to the game mode like maybe in\-game announcer packs from the RLCS guys, actual stats to peruse throughout the season, a more rewarding experience for winning the season, creating a team that plays for multiple seasons instead of just completely resetting after a season, better AI \(I'll grant this last one is very difficult\) etc. 

Tournament mode: I was hyped about this. I also play LoL and they are in the midst of releasing a similar, but much much better game mode in my opinion. This tournament game mode is only viable for streamers or people that can somehow organize like 32 people to play in a RL tournament at the same time. I thought this was going to introduce tournaments you could enter like monthly or something to play against people in your rank for more exclusive rewards, and you would have to buy or earn tickets to enter the tournament so it felt like there was something at stake. I don't know about the majority, but I haven't used this game mode even once, because I would rather play ranked. I have heard they are maybe moving towards this being a more fun and important game mode, but as it stands now, I think it was a failure. 

Custom Training: Another feature pysonix hasn't touched since releasing and now seems extremely outdated. Add a rating system, so players can rate packs out of 5 and have a tab showing top rated packs in each category over different time frames. Add a similar system for training pack authors and allow people to follow them. It helps people find packs they like and gives more recognition to people like Biddles who put in a lot of time to make good packs. Allow a search feature so you can look for strikers, goaltending etc.. If you like a playlist, have a ""If you liked this, try these..."" showing other similar packs people liked. There are so many possibilities about how you can expand this feature and make it something actually fun and usable but you can really still access only like 50 packs from the menu unless you know the codes for others. 

You know what all of these features have in common? They are gameplay related. Now I am not an idiot, I know that cosmetics is where MP games make their money and I respect that they have to do it, but for me it seems like psyonix isn't interested in refining or updating their gameplay to keep it new and interesting, but would rather release weekly crates. I have been playing this game for 3 years and have over 1000 hours, but with all of these problems, along with the worst server performance of any big MP except maybe PUBG, I don't know if I see myself playing this game in a year like I do with other MP games I play.

What am I going to do?",moonchildkarma,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8nkx1n/alone_f18_in_california_boyfriend_m20_just_dumped/,"I am originally from the midwest. I just finished my freshman year of college at a great school in Southern California. During my freshman year, I met an older boy. We started dating. He convinced me that rather than going home, I should find an internship and stay in California this summer. I did exactly that. I found a wonderful, welling paying internship in my career field. Then, I found a part time job as a hostess at a high dining restaurant as well.

After going home for two weeks, I just moved into my apartment across the street from his fraternity two days ago. Him and I shared a storage unit since he’s also from
the midwest, so my mom and I made trips to to get my things. It took us awhile. I saw my boyfriend, spent the night, had sex, caught up, etc. Everything seemed fine. Yesterday, my mom flew home back to the midwest. That night, I go over to my boyfriends fraternity because it’s the president’s birthday. I get decently drunk, but still perfectly functioning. He disappears for a bit. I text him and ask him where he’s gone, he says fortnite. He comes back, gets me, and we go to his room. 

Now, this is where things go awry. I, the perfect girlfriend, am wearing lingerie. I paid 60 dollars for a brazilian while I was at home. I want to he sex with my boyfriend I hadn’t seen for three weeks. As I try to initiate something, he hesitates. I can tell he doesn’t want to do this. I finally convince him to tell me what’s going on. He says he’s tired, he doesn’t want to. I say okay. However, I feel terrible. I felt like I was forcing myself on to him? Has he felt this way before? Am I really such a wh*re that my own boyfriend doesn’t want to have sex with me? I felt disgusting about myself. My mind was racing with what went wrong. I get in bed and begin to cry. He comes up and I apologize profusely. I felt terrible about making him do something he didn’t want to, but at the same time, why wouldn’t he want to have sex with his girlfriend when it had been so long? I tell him I just want him to be honest. He tells me he doesn’t want to have sex with me because he isn’t feeling it anymore. He wants to break up. I immediately say, if you want to break up, we’re breaking up. I think I felt my heart physically shatter in my chest. As we go back and forth, I try to understand. He says he doesn’t feel like he’s productive or getting things done anymore. I have done nothing wrong, I am a great girlfriend he says. This part, confused the fuck out of me. I am beautiful, smart, and funny. I have two jobs this summer. He doesn’t have a single one yet. He swears he has an internship, but he hasn’t started it. He’s been spending his days reading and going to the pool. How the FUCK am I what’s holding him back from success? 

Eventually, I leave. I walk home shaking, crying, and in the dark alleyway alone. On this walk, I realized. I don’t have any friends or family here this summer. The only person I had has just told me they don’t want to be with me anymore, even though I did nothing wrong. I feel so helpless, Reddit. I have struggled with depression in the past and I am very afraid I am going to crash and burn due to loneliness this summer. I’ll be living alone all summer. I have jobs, but they’re working mostly with older adults, not anyway I could make friends. What am I going to do? 

Today is the first day of my internship and I’ve been fighting tears all morning. He knew I started today too, what a nice guy. 

TL;DR Boyfriend convinced me to stay, then dumps me. Now, I’m alone in San Diego for the summer. I have no friends to help me through this.

My GPA was solid \(3.68\), I had quite a lot of exposure to R, some SAS, and some SQL through a job where I was helping to build a graphics system using D3.js at a university lab. I was also briefly involved with some astronomy research that used a little R and presented a poster at conference.

But I can't seem to get a job. At first I was struggling to apply to positions because I didn't meet every criterion on the listing, and I still worry that I'm not really proficient enough in any technology or analysis to actually be useful. Still, I feel like I'm a relatively qualified applicant for someone who just graduated college, but after spending 6 months looking for a job, I've only had one interview. I've had multiple career advisers look over my resume and cover letter, and I've been tailoring those to fit each job I've applied to, so I'm confused as to why I'm not hearing back on any of these positions.

I'm getting extra frustrated now because most the entry level and internship jobs in data analysis in my area seem to have dried up for the time being, and I'd really like to have something locked down by the end of July.

2. High interest in computers, gaming and just technology in general 
3. Motive to try a new major

But I have a few questions for those who are already in the profession 
1. Does it require a lot of math? (I’m not very good with math)
2. How is life post graduation? Mentally, financially and in general?
3. What is it exactly that a software developer does? (ELI5) 
4. How do you get working on projects for your portfolio? 
5. Is it easy to find internships?
6. Where I live there are boot camps for software development, has anyone had experience with these camps and would you suggest taking a boot camp instead of going to college and getting a bachelors degree?

8nmdhb,3,2018-05-31,AMAB Confused,Am_I_Victoria,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/8nmdhb/amab_confused/,"This is gonna be messy because I am organizing my thoughts as I am typing here. Also not a native speaker :\(

I am AMAB, grew up in Asia but with fairly liberal parents \(the ""if you're gay it's okay"" type, not so sure about transgender\). My sexual fantasy has been 80&amp;#37; about being a woman. Masturbation has almost been exclusively to those. I never really thought it was too much of a problem, and did feel irritated when called a girl as a kid \(not sure if that matters\) I did crossdress with my sister's skirts.

Went to an all boys prep school, mostly hung out with the nerds, but was generally respected for my good grades so I was not exactly a social outcast, just with fewer friends. Many of the manlier things I didn't really get / understand, but certainly enjoys some of the male camaraderie.

The first time this thought of being a woman was going to college. I came to America for college and thought about experimenting with this. But very soon, I was overwhelmed with trying to get girlfriend, etc., and did not really think about myself as transgender. In sophomore year, a \(definitely cis\- and really straight\) girl asked me out. She slowly grew to be my most important friend and we even manage to get her \(super typically Asian\) parents to accept me stealing their precious daughter away.

Running on a crazy streak of sex with her, I didn't really think much about being a woman at all, until post\-college, when we went long\-distance. By then I was mature enough to understand that masturbation is completely natural and often times do it out of boredom. I slowly got into transgender erotica, but for the most part just considered it as how most guys get of when they need some stimulation. I tried porn, of course, but the thought of seeing a guy naked isn't my thing.

Then there was a month when my girlfriend was between leases and decided to study at my place for a while. Feeling a bit shameful, I did not read anything and went no\-fap for 2 weeks. Whenever I am bored, I look up transgender things, which ended up leading me to this subreddit. I was scared shitless, naturally, and felt a heavy wave of anxiety, together with all my IBS and insomnia, upon myself. It felt like my entire identity has been shattered into pieces and I don't know who I am anymore, just floating from day to day. I came clean to my girlfriend, and went to see a therapist. I was under a lot of pressure at the time, as the girlfriend and I were so serious that we were considering to get married soon.

The therapist asked me some hypothetical questions, like ""if you go to an imaginary planet, do you see yourself as male or female?"", and some mental exercise such as ""spend a day while picturing yourself as a woman through the crowds?"" but I didn't really get very far. I eventually had to stop the sessions because I found them not very helpful in exploring myself as well as starting an internship in a different city for a summer.

A change of scenery helped a lot. I felt like an emotional wreck still, but I restructured my character and rebuild a sense of identity. I no longer feel very strongly that I need to appear masculine, but I was quite happy about the new version of male identity I found. I took it as a clean bill of health, and eventually proposed to my girlfriend \(henceforth, fiancée\).

She has a lapse of lease again and lived with me in the past month. I felt fine and quite manly being the person taking care of her, but then one night she asked me if I still read erotica and if I am sure I am male. I told her yes, but it started a downward spiral again. Frantically looking up things information \(both sexual, like ""how does first sex as woman feel like?"", to ""how to come out to people around you?"", etc\), I feel the wave of anxiety I felt before, with my constantly arguing with myself whether I am trans. Sometimes when I said to myself ""I am trans"", and felt immensely anxious, but sometimes I feel calm. Sometimes I thought I established that I am trans, but then argued that I probably am cis / NB. It does not help that I realize this might also be pure\-O OCD. I also get so distracted every time I see a woman, I'd desperately want to figure out if I want to be her, or want to have sex with her. In short, boredom \+ anxiety \+ fiancee's pressure on my to figure myself up \+ her bringing up previous questioning = insane anxiety and OCD\-like thoughts. I intend to go back to see a therapist soon. Here's some questions I have:

\- How do I make more out of a therapy session? The last one was inconclusive. Should I see a gender therapist, or one who's more specialized in OCD? I can't tell what's affecting me.

\- I feel comfortable as male, but sometimes feel a urge as female? How often is too often. Can I just be NB?

\- For transwoman who started off on the fence and were decently happy about your male life with no dysphoria, how did you figure out?

\- I want to experiment more, but I want to stay under the radar. What are some good things to try on my own?"
8nmfmf,1,2018-05-31,My [22M] girlfriend [21F] is sick of my BS and has threatened to break up with me unless I get my shit together. How can I save my relationship with her?,DoubleHammy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8nmfmf/my_22m_girlfriend_21f_is_sick_of_my_bs_and_has/,"Reddit, I need some advice on how to save my relationship with my girlfriend. In order to do that I should probably supply you with some background information. 

My girlfriend (21) and I (22) have been dating a little over a year now. We had a nice relationship in the beginning; we were both in college, I interned at a company nearby so I had a steady income. I live with my parents but I also had a car and was able to see her quite often. I should probably also mention my parents bought the car for me and I’m slowly paying them back with my internship money. 

Well my internship ended and my car got taken away by my parents (2 reasons, 1. I had no job to keep paying back my parents, and 2. I got caught sneaking out of my parents house to see her around midnight in the summer). I decided not to get another job to focus primarily on school since I was a senior and wanted to achieve better grades for this academic year. 

After my car got taken away, she was still happy being with me but she assumed that I would get my car back pretty fast. I haven’t been able to get a job or convince my parents to get me my car back for about ten months now and it’s really testing her patience. We saw each other pretty regularly during the school year but ever since summer has started I’ve only been seeing her 2-3 times a week, and she’s going to study abroad in Morocco in the fall so she feels that I don’t give her enough time. 

My parents are also extremely strict, I’ve been using their car to go out and see her when I can, but sometimes for no apparent reason they just restrict my ability to use their car, and I can’t really do anything about since it’s not my car and I live under their roof. She can pick me up from my house but we live 30 minutes from one another and I don’t really want to be a burden on her since she’s already put up with a lot. 

I recently graduated from college with a degree in Computer Science but haven’t landed a job in Engineering yet. She wants me to work a part time job so that I can see her more often, and while I agree that I need something to pass the time/start paying my debt, my parents have explicitly told me I won’t get my car back unless I land an engineering job. Buying a new car or moving out isn’t really an option because I currently am in debt and have $0 to my name. My girlfriend has threatened to break up with me unless I can get my shit together, and there is no doubt in my mind that when I land a job, I’m definitely moving out of my parents house, because of my extremely controlling parents. I've also been applying to full-time jobs since January, have gotten a few interviews but haven't landed anything yet. 

I haven’t been able to provide a timeline to my girlfriend about when I can move out and work because it all really depends when I can land a job. I’m sort of stuck in a fickle situation and don’t really know what to do, so any advice would be helpful. I want to make it work but I don’t really know how. 

**TL;DR: I need some advice on how to fix my relationship with my girlfriend because I’m broke and in debt and don’t have the means to see her and she’s getting sick of my shit.**"

I'm on an internship and our goal is to essentially use Postman (an API environment) to HTTP into server rack units, get all their inventory info (HDs, CPUs, etc. Etc.) And store that info. My problem is we don't have a concrete method to automate that and none of the Dell, hp or Cisco firmwares will update to accept redfish. Any suggestions? Firstly, can I update firmwares to the newest, or is there a certain extent I can check the compatibility before hand?"
8nn8bk,1,2018-05-31,"M4F - Pledging Kappa Upsilon Mu [group, public, cum challenges]",inventorofdreams,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8nn8bk/m4f_pledging_kappa_upsilon_mu_group_public_cum/,"Everyone at Southern Louisiana University of Teaching and Service knew the top sorority was Kappa Upsilon Mu. They raised the most money in the annual charity drive, they’d won the beach volleyball tournament four years in a row, held the best parties, and maintained the highest GPA on campus. And they were connected; being a sister at Kappa Upsilon Mu opened all kinds of doors. A KUM girl would have her pick of internships and could count on multiple job offers at graduation. 

Naturally, competition to get in was fierce and there was a rigorous if strangely secretive process. You had the GPA, the extracurricular activities. You’d made it through the first two rounds, a rather dizzying session of brief introductions and chats with KUM members, and then a somewhat longer session including a tour of the house. Now they’d asked you back for a third round. Alone. Although there were of course strict policies against hazing these days, you couldn’t help feeling a little nervous. But being accepted into KUM would be worth it, whatever it took. 

And so you went to the house. Remembering the advice you’d read on dressing nicely, you’d put on a sundress and sandals with a modest heel, along with tasteful makeup. When you arrived at the house, Beth and Lexi, two of the members you’d met before invited you. “Thanks for coming,” Lexi said, “We’ve really enjoyed talking with you earlier. However, we have a particular culture at KUM and we want to make sure new members will fit in. So follow me, please.” 

They took you down to the basement, a part of the house you hadn’t seen before. The floor was carpeted, with cushions of varying sizes strewn around. But what captured your attention was the five men standing in a row. Naked. All looked like they might be members of the swim team. They smiled when they saw you walk in.

Lexi took out her phone. “This is your first test to see if you have what it takes to be part of KUM. You have ten minutes to get them off. You can tell them what to do, but all five have to cum on you or in you in the time allotted to pass the challenge. I’ll give you a minute to prepare, and when I say, “Go!” your time starts. 
***
Let’s just say KUM’s recruitment methods would not be approved by the Panhellenic Council. Not a story with a lot of buildup here. I have a few similar challenges in mind after this one to take you through the process of joining KUM, all focusing on public and risky play, a fair amount of group stuff, and of course, lots of cum. I’ll handle the various guys. I had been thinking your character would know exactly what joining KUM meant and would be enthusiastic about it, but if you want to play more surprised and reluctant that’s perfectly OK with me. 

If this appeals to you please respond with some information about your character (including her name and description), your thoughts about what you’d like to do with this story, and a little continuation of the scene. Feel free to ask any questions as well. See my [profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/4xhj26/m4f_inventing_dreams/) for more information about what I'm into.

I was wondering if there was a web blocker software which allowed me to add new allowable sites over time. If I could, I would have some sites already allowed, then add them per request, and review. thank you much all."
