3uxpk6,6,2015-11-30,[UPDATE] I [21/F] feel hopelessly lonely.,MilknBones,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3uxpk6/update_i_21f_feel_hopelessly_lonely/,"My initial post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tehqz/i_21f_feel_hopelessly_lonely/] didn't get a lot of attention but I received a lot of warming messages. So thank you.

/u/lanadeltorro asked for an update, and also I have some things to get off my chest so here it is.

Do I still feel lonely? Yes. But I now have a bigger duty to take care of other than myself.
My mother was very recently diagnosed with cancer.

Actually, I don't know where to start. It's all very complicated. She was visiting family in our home country (Korea) and she just got a check up because she's been having stomach problems. Seems like our family has a history of stomach cancer, 3 of her 4 uncles had stomach cancer too.

She got tested and initially the results came back with H. Pylori, which is some kind of ulcer causing bacteria? I don't know, the results were all in Korean and I'm not as fluent as I'd like to be (I left Korea when I was 2). She was supposed to come back today, in time for my sister's high school graduation tomorrow but she had more tests and it turns out the bacteria caused cancer. Now she just has to check how far it has spread so she's staying in Korea for more tests, but during our phone call she estimates she has about a year to live.

It all feels very surreal right now. She hasn't told me this to face yet, so it still doesn't feel real. The only thing that feels real is the statistics I found online and it doesn't look good.

Furthermore, my father and mother have been having problems for a while. There is some sort of financial battle going on between them (has been for a while), and inevitably will come to me when my mother passes. Back story, my father left us back for our Korea when he couldn't find a job here (his decision). He was supposed to come back after 3 years but it's been something like 16 or so years now, details removed, he just kinda started a new life.

I'll probably be my mother's primary caregiver when she gets back home. My younger sister who will turn 18 in a month will be starting university in a new city. I'm luckily studying in my city. It'll just be me and my mum next year.

My younger sister (the one that's graduating high school) knows that something serious is happening (serious enough for our mother to miss her graduation) but we haven't told her about the cancer yet but she'll inevitably pick it up because she's smart like that. We didn't want to tell her yet because she's doing her exams at the moment. She's going to visit Korea in a couple of weeks to be with my mum. I have an internship so I'm staying here.

My initial post was about how lonely I felt. I'm not sure how this will affect me in the long run. Right now, I don't even feel anything anymore. I cried all last night and couldn't sleep. At work I was totally zoned out, started crying in the foyer, a couple of people saw and asked if I was okay and I said yes. Otherwise I tried to act happy as always. I told my supervisor at work and he was understanding. I also told a coworker/friend and he's being supportive too in a coworker/friend type of way.

I told my boyfriend over phone call. He doesn't know how to react either. In my prior post I said he's the only person whose company I enjoy. But he's pretty distant and I don't want to appear too upset in front of him, I'm scared I'll push him away. I'm too scared to ask for his support because I have a big feeling he'll be bothered by it. He's been nice today, texting me and answering my phone calls even while he's at work. But he said he won't visit me today when I asked if he could come around. Then again, I did see him basically everyday for the past week and he's probably worn out of my company.

I honestly don't know how to talk to him without the worry of pushing him away. Before you tell me to break up with him, he does do some incredibly nice things for me too. He helps financially, and practically. Just not so much emotionally. (He's just not very good at this, he said it himself).

I'm not sure if this in an update, more of a ramble on about what's happening in my life right now because I feel like I just want to tell someone about it and I feel like I don't have anyone to talk about it with. Sorry for the long post.

   
**tl;dr**: I'm still lonely, but I now have a bigger duty. My mother has cancer. I'm going to be her primary caregiver. I need emotional support, but my boyfriend is not good with emotional stuff."

I have an internship where I work full time and make a little more than $1400 a month. I am being forced to move out of my house because my parents basically want the house to themselves. The situation sucks but it is what it is. I plan on being out in 2-3 weeks. I'm going to look at places this weekend and they are about 400-450 a month for a one bedroom. Don't have anyone else to room with which sucks, but once again it is what it is. So I've come up with: 
rent: $400-450
Utilities: $100
Internet and basic cable: $65
Car insurance: $90
Phone: $50
Gas: $70
Food: $200
Misc: $100
Savings: $100

Total expenses so far: $1225

Is there anything I'm missing or anything I can do to make any of this cheaper? I already have all my furniture and cooking utensils as well. I can also work on the weekends to make some extra cash, and I also get a pay raise after I finish this year of school. Please offer any guidance, tips, or anything else that will help me.

I recently changed my major to Business Administration. I am beginning to search for internships that will take place next summer. I am having a difficult time finding much. I have tried searching generally for ""internships"" and I have even tried searching for ""business internships."" What are some keywords that I should be using in my searches, and what more can I search to find better results. A lot of the job postings that I am finding are not even for internships. 

I am not certain what I want to do specifically, but I know that I want to work with people on a daily basis. Whether this is a consulting role, sales role, or something along those lines, I am sure I would thrive because I have excellent interpersonal skills.

What are some good websites to search for internships on? I have tried the job posting sites like Monster, Indeed, etc. and even Chegg Internships but I am not having much luck. Only a couple of things that really peak my interest!

Thank you for the help!

It's always been around christmas/ my birthday for whatever reason but every time I try to explain why I want to break up she doesn't listen then we end up back together.

This relationship doesn't make me feel happy. I guess the spark just isn't there for me but I have a hard time explaining that and if I try she just blames herself and then I feel bad and can never go through with the break up. She's always telling me how happy I make her and how great I am which just makes it harder. 

She also gets extremely jealous to the point where I am afraid to mention any other girls to her like friends coworkers etc.. She even gets mad when I talk to her sister for too long. It stresses me out. This entire relationship stresses me out along with, school, work, and an internship I feel like i'm always on the verge of falling apart. I know the answer to my ""problems"" is to end it and make myself happy but I just can't seem to do it. 



   
**tl;dr**: Not happy in my 3 year relationship, but my girlfriend is extremely happy. I don't know what to do."

Does this mean I'll for sure be going? I know that the email said I needed to be offered an interview first, but i read an article saying that if you're being considered for something, you're most likely going to be picked. 

I'm an education major, which is the position I applied for. Im currently an instructional assistant in a school and I'm about to start my student teaching in an s.e.i class, which will help me since the position I'm being considered for is to teach English. Besides the current teaching I've  been doing, I have had almost 300 internship hours in various classroom settings from k-7th grade as well as in special education classrooms. I've also had experience volunteering out of the classroom as well. I compete in pageants and have won a few different titles in various systems, with my platform always being ""education for all"". I've done work with charity organizations, homeless shelters, and other work. I also have taught dance classes for the past 10 years. I'm confident with myself and with my resume, but I'm starting to doubt whether I'll be chosen for anything or not. The biggest concern I have is that when I submitted my application I didn't have my teaching license and I'm afraid that that will keep them from picking me. However, I'll get my license before I graduate in April. 

What are the chances of me being picked?  And what do they look for? Also, if I do get interviewed, what type of questions will be asked? And where is the interview conducted?

I posted a request a couple of days ago but I have sense figured out a way to drop the cost.

I am located in Lexington KY and need help with moving costs. I am a Computer Science/Mathematics student at the University of Kentucky and just landed an internship in Atlanta GA for the spring semester. Instead of searching for an apartment first I am going to do AirBnB and stay for two weeks until I get my school financial aid. This will run me about $800 instead of $2200 for a deposit and first months rent on an apartment. I also have to pay ~$150 for a rental car to get to the new city. I have money to make it in Lexington but my budget does not cover an entire new place in a city (with higher cost of living).

I will receive financial aid through the university in the amount of $13,000, which will be dispersed to me in a few smaller payments throughout the month of January. The internship pays $4150 a month as well, so I will have no problem paying the money back. The entire situation is just bad timing, as I will have plenty of money about a month after I need it. I am able to provide any proof that is requested. As stated in the title I need $1000 and can pay back $1250, I am willing to negotiate on that as well (as I don't have another option). It is highly possible that I will repay on the 15th of January but I am saying the 30th to be safe. Let me know if I am missing any information and thank you for reading.

3uykdk,2,2015-12-01,How do I [22/M] explain to one of my best friends [22/F] that I recognize my role in ruining her life?,weatherupthere,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3uykdk/how_do_i_22m_explain_to_one_of_my_best_friends/,"Hi guys and gals, I need your advice. And no, this actually isn't about anything romantic actually, which might make it even worse :(


I have/had a really good friend, Daisy, who've I've known since middle school. We grew up together, and ended up going to university together. We've been each other confidantes about many things: life, family, relationships, etc. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but no, we have never had a relationship with one another besides friendship.

===== Background =====

In our last year of school, I was present at two points in Daisy's life that haunt both me and her to this day:

The first point was when she and I were hanging out, and she was debating accepting an offer from a company she had interned at over the summer. We had talked during that summer and it was clear the internship stressed her out immensely, and as she hovered over the job offer, she talked about how she was very unsure about whether or not she should take the job offer since it would contractually bind her to the position for 2 years. She ended up also calling her mother, although I do not recall what advice her mother had given her. What I do remember is telling her not to take the position if she didn't want it. I told her that if such a company (and it was a fairly prestigious one) would take her, then she could go somewhere else that might make her happier. She ended up rejecting the offer, and continued to apply to other jobs.


Fast forward a few months, I check in with Daisy and ask her to hang out, since she seemed stressed out about work and study at the time. We start talking about how we're both doing, and it becomes clear she is feeling buried by the amount of schoolwork,  extracurricular obligations, and job hunting. I try to cheer her up by trying to help her find activities that she enjoys doing and convincing her to invest some time in those things. At that point, she completely breaks down into tears, and as I try to console her and  restore her composure enough to ask her what was wrong, she tells me she has realized at that very moment that she doesn't do anything anymore that makes her happy. She continues sobbing, and I do my best to help her stay together. When I had to leave that night, I informed her other best friends about the situation, and to keep me in the loop. We agree later on that I should keep my distance for a while.

We both graduate still thinking of each other as good friends. After I ended up finding a job and moving to another city, I eventually lost touch with her as I got sidetracked with learning how to be an adult.

===== Present =====

Recently, I've been trying to reach out to Daisy. After 2 separate attempts over a month to get in touch with her, I got radio silence. I sent one final message on Facebook messenger saying that I think of her as a good friend, and I respect any wishes she might have not to speak to me, and stopped trying to talk to her.

Tonight, I got one message from Daisy saying saying that she thinks of me as a good friend, and apologizes for the lack of contact; she has been avoiding social media for mental health reasons, and continued unemployment hasn't helped  her either. But she ended the message saying she would still like to catch up.

I respond with a message wishing her well, and trying to set up a time to talk. Thanks to the uncomfortable tracking abilities of Facebook messenger, I know that she has seen the message, and didn't respond back.

===== The Dilemma =====

I am wracked with guilt that my past interactions with Daisy have taken an intelligent woman that was full of life and completely dragged her down through the dumps. I have never forgotten those two moments, where I know for certain I am responsible for the way she is now. I had always thought she would recover and bounce back with time, and it's clear that isn't the case. I would do anything, even ruin my own friendship with her, to restore her happiness and stability.

If we ever get in touch again, I want to apologize to her and explain to her that I have never forgotten the moments where I have messed up her life, and that I accept any hatred or grudges or anything she holds against me. However, I am extremely worried that doing so might relapse her road to recovery, thus adding to the count of times I've been a disaster in her life.

I'm looking for any thoughts or opinions as to how to approach this. Do I tell her? Or do I wait until I think she is in a better place? Or do I not tell her at all?

tl;dr **I, and I alone, was present at key conversations in my friend's life that ultimately have left her jobless and made her go through a mental breakdown. We're connecting again, and I need to know how to make amends, please help.**

3uz7np,1,2015-12-01,20F4A - The Dark Journey to Stardom - From Secretary to Super Star,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3uz7np/20f4a_the_dark_journey_to_stardom_from_secretary/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.


----------


I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K Messenger, skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp. If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

3uzmeg,2,2015-12-01,I don't know what is happening to me,oom9,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3uzmeg/i_dont_know_what_is_happening_to_me/,"Hello everyone. I just made an account in reddit but i love to browse /r/Askreddit. I am usually scared of talking about myself but since I have nobody to talk about this. So here i am, oom9, I'm French (sorry for my english).
Until my 16th birthday i was a pretty happy guy, i always felt different but i didn't care since i had good friends. I had a good enought armor which protected me from sadness until i encounter some suicidal tendencies : i was in love with my best friend, she didn't. I was the kind of guy who was posting his misery on facebook but nobody cared and from this point i realized that the world was far from what i expected, that i was so naive. I also realized that my parents despite being  generally nice were depressing me : my mother is like a chinese father, i had to get good grades, become a doctor etc. Once i finished highschooll, i had to choose my path. My mother wants my hapiness but can't help to define her hapinness as my hapiness. I remember, i went with my parents to a doctor. My parents told it was just a classic health check. I passed many tests (earing, sight, etc). I began to be suspicious when the doctor asked me to touch my balls (for cancer you know). When i asked her why, we both realized i had no idea what i was doing here. In fact, it was a big health check for entering in military doctors school. We were both like WTF??? The doctor then spoke to my mother telling her it's not her choice but mine and then she asked what i wanted to do. I didn't have a clue but i felt i had to say something so i said computering because i loved videogames.
Well this story shows how my mother is (she also sent my sister to an asylum because she was bipolar). I still love her in a certain way because she can't help it and just want my hapiness but she is terribly hurtful and my father just do nothing (he is still very nice).
I met my best friend during my computering studies. We were really really close, so close that i was scared that people would joke on us being gay. My best friend had very high morals standards, he was so depressed because of the world where we live. Yet, he was super jealous and he always got mad when i hung out with other people (specially a girl). In his head, 99% of the population were selfish people, sheeps etc.

I was very unhappy with my studies and computering wasn't for me. I was pretty sad because i had to work in this sector until i'm 60 and really didn't feel it (when i was young i wanted to be an archeologist but couldnt because of my mother). i began to be fed up with my lealous Best Friend. Then my sister told me about genius people, i read a book about how i was sad because i was different from others be cause i was maybe a genius. I found a lot of my thoughts in this book and decided to take an IQ test (my best friend too). Well, the book was right, i was a genius (but i don't feel superior). I was really angry because i realized i was a smart guy and i spoiled it by doing computering instead of something that pleased.

This year, i decided that i was going nowhere with my best friend. I met a nice girl, unfortunately she was the girlfriend of one of my friends. She hit on me while we were all in a bar and we kissed in front of her boyfriend. I have to tell you i wasn't proud of it nor the girl but we were both drunk and the boyfriend forgave me. When i told this story to my best friend, he lost his shit and spend 1 hour making me more awful.
Months later, the girl breaks up with the boyfriend and we make out. I was feeling in love with this girl but i didn't want to be a douchebag so i went to see her ex. He told me this ""Be careful oom9, she can fell in love real fast but she can also break away real fast too"". Well i tought he was just being jealous so i didn't pay attention.
I told my best friend that i had a girlfriend but i wanted to still remain friends with him (he cried, was angry at me) and now we see eachother once/twice a week. Sometimes i regret leaving him but then i remember how jealous he is and i think it's for the better.

Real relationships are weird. At te beginning everything was cool with my GF. I did some mistakes : i was always late when i had to go her home. She is really insecure and seeks help by talking. The problem is that we live far from eachother and she needed to call me to discuss about her life. I don't like socials medias, phones so i fount it pretty uncool but heh it tried to phone her etc.
3 days ago i really fucked up, i went to her home late she was really angry (aka she was fixing the void when i was with her). When i asked her what was the problem, she began to cry. Well, she thinks I am not enought commited (i have to phone more and be more organized). Well, ok i promised to change but then she said ""im sorry but if you re not here, i will seek attention somewhere else. I m talking to a guy via Facebook and i begin to fantasize"". Wasted. She was crying because she knew i was doidng efforts and she was shameful for fantasizing about others guys even if she loves me.
I really love her. I understand her feelings and i can't help thinking it's my fault (i'am late, i don't like to talk with SMS/facebook) and i have to change.
But i can't help thinking about my live :
-my studies suck. I don't want to work hard for money. I don't care about money. I'm feeling like i have learn nothing and won't find the internship i seek.
-my parents suck. My mother is an helicopter parent and my father doesn't care.
-Things are differents with my bestfriend. It will never be like before.
- I'm feeling like an hostage in my relationship (improve yourself or i ll find another personn). I know i have to improve myself but can't stop thinking about the guys she is texting. I could know if it's serious or not but i don't want to investigate her PC.

So i'm thinking about suicides everyday. I don't want to do it but i think about it all the time ""I don't want to die now, maybe later in my life"". I'm trapped by myself and my thoughts. It's awful i don't know what to do.

I am an intern in a big company and I met this guy through a common friend. I really had no intention of dating him and I saw him as an older brother and a mentor, but everyone in the office were teasing me with him despite the age difference. We'd hang out a lot with friends. When there were moments when we're alone, he'd hold my hand, cuddle with me, sleep on my lap, etc. In short, he was giving me weird signals. 

Fast forward to my birthday, two nights before, he messaged me saying that he couldn't make it to my party (although, I only had the intention of inviting him and told a common friend about it but I never invited him yet) and he'd want to make it up to me by watching a movie with me (Inside Out). I agreed since I had no other plans. Things got a little tense after the movie when we went to his flat and we made out and hooked up. He added: ""he just wants to make out with me"". So okay, I thought, I wasn't really into him so I played it cool and went home.

Few months after, we saw each other a lot through several meetups with friends. We'd play tabletop games and we'd go to bars with friends obviously. He opened up to me about his ex-girlfriend of seven years and her dating again made him feel so broken. Being a good friend, I told him that I was going out on a three day vacation and he might want to join the tour so he could take his mind off stuff. He agreed. 

Nights prior to the vacation trip, he took me to his place and after some time hanging out with him, he'd start kissing me and when things got so intense, we hooked up. It happened twice. I still played it cool, but I never asked why. But deep down, I've started hating myself because I know he's playing me around. 

I wanted to confront him about the kiss, but the vacation trip happened. I couldn't bring up the topic since it might ruin the vacation, obviously. But while we were on the trip, he started to distance himself around me and he rarely talked to me throughout. It made me sad not being able to enjoy the trip and he was acting weird. A common friend said that he might be dealing with his ex-girlfriend (probably they're patching things up). When we came back, I apologized (I don't know why) for my strange behavior and I told him I was really stressed seeing him like that. He apologized too, after that we never talked.

Recently, things have become more awkward and I feel that both of us are trying to avoid and become distant to one another. In a recent hangout with a common friend, we're totally separated from one another and we wouldn't look at each other in the eye. Although, I did try reaching out to him and me wanting to remain his friend, but he was acting all jittery and anxious around me.

   I'm looking for my first internship!  I grew up in Worthington and now am a junior in college (out of state/country).  During the summer months, I return to Columbus to live with my parents (although, depending on where I get to intern, that may change).  I'm doing a double major in economics and geography, but I don't really know what I want to do with my degree when I graduate.  Because of this, I'm open to a wide range of summer internship experiences.

   I would love to hear the opportunities you know about in the Columbus area.  If any of you have interned at any companies in town, hearing about your experience would be a big help.  So far, I have applied to a couple of investment management groups, and I plan on applying to Sherrod Brown's office soon.  


general technical skills:
-some GIS (this would be a cool thing to learn more of through an an internship)
-Microsoft Excel
-some Java coding

note: I am open to internships that require these skills (especially GIS), but I am certainly not insisting that the internship I pursue involves them

Any input you guys have for me is appreciated.  Apologies if I am posting this in the wrong subreddit.  "

As stated in the title, I'm looking for a place to rent from mid january in Brussels.

It's even hard for me to articulate this well, to confirm that I've got too many things going on in my mind and I'm stuck like never in my life. 

Quick summary: 33yo, lived in Australia for 7 years, recently moved back home (Europe) to assist my family with my mum's impromptu heart surgery. She's now well and beautiful. My parents love me. Financially we're ok, they do own two apartments and one commercial premise. I'm a lucky MF. I'm very social, lots of friends, although I just moved from a 5m people city to a 3,500 small town and I'm feeling like shit as I won't ever be able to live here again. My parents don't ask me to stay here, they just want me to be happy (although that means financially happy, to my mum)

My biggest issue is work. I don't know what I wanna do. I've never known. I know that sport is my passion, but given that a) I didn't wanna spend my weekends with elderly b) it had years and years of internships ahead c) i wanted to travel I didn't pursue my initial career in journalism. I went for business and I've been quite successful at it (always worked for someone).


A year ago, I quit my job - high salary, great lifestyle, fastest growing company in the country. I hated the job and the people I was working for. I wasn't learning anymore. I was, honestly, close to the point where they were gonna fire me. I lost my challenge to be successful, so I gave up and admitted failure instead of just earning $$. I tried to figure it out, I gave up, I was just fed with it.

I went traveling and haven't worked since. I wake up in the morning, have breakfast and go back to my bedroom where I read Reddit or read a) travel blogs b) think about companies I could start.
This is killing me as I **don't know what I wanna do in my life**

I know what I don't want: I don't wanna be locked in an office 5 days a week for the rest of my life, even if that means I could earn good $$. I don't wanna work in something I hate (just reading SEO SEM makes me vomit). My previous job was quite unique as I did manage 70 people who did a bunch of stuff, you can't really narrow it down - I basically ran the dirty part of the business, telling people what to do. Didn't enjoy being always under stress and not learning anything.

What's my passion? It's sports. What would I do? 
a) I'm thinking about working and traveling. Like many crazy travelers, just go and figure it out. And wait for ""The sign"". 
b) Get a temporary job and settle in a new city. Learn something in the meantime. Meet people. Talk to them. Discuss ideas.
One day I wanna be a photographer, one day a music producer, one day a Personal Trainer, a video maker. What would priority be for me? Be location independent. I love my family, but I can't live in this sh*Thole where people my age are already ""dead"". I wanna travel and live abroad, although being 24hrs flight away from my parents was tough. I'd go back if I could come back three times a year...so maybe starting a business is in the cards.


I'm an asshole, let me tell you. I'm reading Reddit stories and I realize how lucky I am. There's some serious sh*t and I'm here complaining with something I can actually deal with. I can change things if I want to. Some redditors have lost families, jobs, they can't control their future. I can. What the hell is stopping me then? 

I'm so fkn confused, sometimes I think I'm depressed and all these thoughts in my head make me thing I'm shit. My mum even went back to work after 2 heart surgeries and I feel like shit, who the fk am I fooling? Happy to answer any question. Sorry for venting.

We've had nearly all of our adult life experiences together, I've never had a better friend and it's icing on the cake that we are romantically involved as well.  We have lived together for one year at this point, and there have been no fights and our relationship seems to only improve with time.  She really is my better half.

We have both told each other that there isn't a single other person that could make us as happy as we make eachother, and I can't see this ending at any point.  We are essentially soul mates, and I would go on and on but it's hard to describe these things in text and I'll save your time.

Basically, I'm 100% sure I love her and she's 100% sure she loves me, I've gotten talked to by her father about marrying her before so I know her family would not be opposed.  No one can say that their marriage will not end in divorce, but I at least know it wouldn't tragically end within two years like a lot of marriages.

This has started to weigh down on my mind since we began looking at properties together in Atlanta, she got an internship there, and if everything goes well I will be teaching there (or something, Atlanta has one of the largest growing job markets in the world.)

Just part of me feels like I'm 21 (I will 22 if/when I marry her) and this may be too young to make such a decision.  But I can't think of a friend, family member, or anyone that I'm anywhere near as close to, and I can't see us separating.  I've been told there are many financial incentives to getting married, and employers see it as a big plus on your resume if you are married because it may be a sign of responsibility / willingness to stay in the area?

I do not plan on having kids until I have an established career.

**tl;dr**: Thinking of marrying my soul-mate, but I may be too young and I am wondering about the benefits and withdraws from getting married this young."
3v1qzk,7,2015-12-01,Future Career Options,MagicMikey88,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3v1qzk/future_career_options/,"Hey guys,

I find myself in a shitty spot in life and wanted to reach out for help from fellow RPers because I expect a certain amount of truth from the community. 

Personally, I fancy myself an intellectually curious person. I know a lot about history, politics, economics, and current events. I take care of myself and have been lifting regularly for the last 5 years. I’m single and I’m what some of you would call purple pill. I still date but it’s very unlikely I will ever get married or have children. 

A little background. I grew up in Pittsburgh and joined the Marine Corps shortly after graduation. I did 4 years as an aviation ordnance man and completed my contract with an honorable discharge. I also did a tour in Iraq. After college, I attended Penn State University on the GI Bill and received 2 B.A.s. One in Political Science and one in Economics. I ended up graduating with a 3.25 GPA and completed a summer internship with the Pennsylvania Governor’s office. 
So then came graduation. I went on about 10 interviews for various positions and no offers. The positions varied. Some claims adjusting positions for insurance companies. Some various positions in the banking industry. I got rejected from all of them. I ended up getting a job as an office temp making $12.00 an hour with no benefits. This whole experience has been a huge bitch slap to the face. I’ve never felt like I was entitled to anything but I was expecting at least something after putting this work in. 

Anyways, my point of this post isn’t to whine, but to ask for advice going forward. I don’t see too much room for advancement where I’m at now. I am currently enrolled for classes in Cyber Security at the local community college. This is the best move forward I could think of at this time. However, my past decisions have got me to where I am now. So I just wanted to reach out to the community and entertain some better moves forward. 

Please answer only if you have ideas on moving forward as opposed to ridiculing past decisions. Thanks in advance.

3v1v3k,2,2015-12-01,I [19M] am struggling immensely with feelings for an ex-girlfriend [18F],SunandFun,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3v1v3k/i_19m_am_struggling_immensely_with_feelings_for/,"Hi everyone, just looking to hopefully get a little advice here in order to figure out what to do because I could really use it right now. I'll try to keep this brief.

This all started roughly five years ago when I met my first girlfriend on the first day of high school. We began dating eight months after we met and carried on all the way through high school. Yes, we endured all the drama and nonsense of a high school relationship. Being just children, our relationship was initially hardly a topic worth any serious thought or consideration. However, we stayed together the whole way through. We changed so much over those four years. By graduation, we were entirely different people from who we were when we first met each other, but we still loved each other in what felt like an unconditional way. Say what you will about the emotional immaturity of teenagers and the lack of serious connections at my age, but it felt like it was meant to be. We would have done anything for each other and to stay together, or so I thought.

Over the summer between graduation and university, I broke up with her. Long story short, I convinced myself it needed to end. We were headed in different directions as far as school choice went and neither one of us wanted to throw away our aspirations, academic pursuits, and ideal school choice. I decided that if we truly loved each other, we would let each other go in order to pursue new lives without baggage and worries. Though it absolutely broke my heart, I had total peace that I was doing the right, logical thing. She wanted to try long-distance, but I refused and said it defeated the purpose of letting go of high school baggage. 

The breakup completely crushed her; she had to get counseling and therapy and had a pretty serious bout with clinical depression, but six months later she rebounded and finally moved on. On the other hand, though I was heartbroken at first, I got over it very quickly. I felt like I was throwing away a once in a lifetime love but I took great solace in the fact that it made logical sense and seemed to promise a baggage-free college experience, and within a month or so I was extremely happy we had parted ways.

In the following months, I essentially forgot about her and fell out of contact. I had many encounters and short relationships with other girls. I would say that I was totally moved and she was distant memory. I never thought of her or worried about her. Furthermore, when I found out that we ended up at schools 2000 miles apart I felt even more vindicated in my decision to split up. Over a year later and two months into my higher education, I felt like everything had worked out perfectly for me.

This has all recently changed. 

Roughly a month and a half ago, she reached out to me over social media. We started talking about college life, internships, classes, etc. It was nice to talk to her and see her doing well, but I was partially annoyed she had tried to reconnect with me - I wanted the past to stay the past. After that, we spoke very casually and sporadically; just when we both had time and nothing better to do. Well, one night about three weeks after we started talking again, she told me she missed being with me. I have no idea what it was about those words that did it, but something changed inside of me. I swear, every emotion from four years of loving this girl boiled over in a split second and I fell back in love with her in that instant. All my feelings crashed down on me like a tonne of bricks. I was overwhelmed and confused but my heart felt like it was on fire for her.

I realize the irrationality and impulsive nature of such feelings and that I likely made a huge mistake reconnecting with her. I am not posting here for advice on how to win her back (though that's all I can think to do right now). Rather, I need to find out how to move on again because I am in a dark place. Every morning, I now wake up and feel like I threw away the most important thing I've ever had. She is the first and last thing I think about every single day. Pictures of her on social media with other people incite a jealousy in me so strong that I can barely stand it. I am depressed and I want to sleep every day away until I can see her again. I can't even hardly focus on my studies or social life because I am having a hard time imagining my future without her. In complete honesty, this is 180* turn from where I was two months ago; I barely even cared about her two months ago.

The sad thing is she isn't a heart breaker or manipulator - I didn't fall into a trap of hers or something. See, she didn't reach out to me to get back together, she just wanted to reestablish a platonic friendship; I am the one who has gone crazy. In fact, she's told me many times since that she doesn't need me anymore and has moved on. She has a new life now that doesn't have room for me. But here I am, torn to pieces. For the sake of brevity, I'll spare further explanation of my emotions. Just know that I am really, really in love with this girl again.

Can anyone offer me advice? What should I do? Does this sound like it could be mental illness? I have a counseling appointment set up already and a tentative date with a psychiatrist afterward. I feel like I am totally out of control and any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.
   
TL;DR: Broke up with a girl I loved because I believed it was the best/right thing to do, moved on and forgot about her over the course of a year, but a recent re-connection has me head over heels in love again. How do I move on and get over her?"

1. I am a 24 year old male. The fact that I am mostly expected to make the first move is a big hindrance. I don't know WHERE I can do such a thing, especially if I don't go clubbing or go to bars. I live in a part of the UK where strangers aren't so social or open to each other. Of course, this is the way the world is and I can't just whine so I am working on that.

2. I come from a traditional family from a part of the world where sexual relationships before marriage aren't the norm. And I live with my parents. This is not a complaint. I intend to keep my romantic life separate from my family life for the time being. I want to respect my parents, and also take things very slowly, as my only previous relationship of 4 years was terrible. Is this off-putting?

3. Finally, my attitude towards sex is complex, because of my upbringing. Long story short, I enjoy it but I had it only a couple of times before. And usually afterwards I feel quite guilty and bad. I don't know if people who were raised in a predominantly ""Western"" way have the same thing. I did hear about everyone experiencing a ""down"" after having sex. Would my attitude, and lack of experience be an issue?

The ladies on here are especially welcome to tell me what they think.

Although I live with my parents at my age, I am not a ""loser"". I have a part time job in a kitchen. And am starting an internship soon related to my masters degree (international law). So I have a rough plan. I am also intending to publish independent work on semi-professional blogs related to the field; nothing too serious. So I will be busy as is, but I am feeling lonely and ready for a companion.

Anyway, if you have read up to here then thank you.

Being a long time listener, first time caller with every moment of the show, really, this was how it should have ended.

Opie bringing in Jimmy and pushing show prep onto Sam this last decade has led to completely justifiable pestering by his ""old fans"". Opie's laziness and social autism is the *only* reason that his show with Jimmy will and always will be the hot garbage plate Brother Wease scarfs down and proudly shits out with a stroke inducing smile. Period. 

Jimmy was always best friends with Ant, Sam, Erock, Travis, the interns. Who was Jimmy never close with? Opie, you fucking idiots. But who cares about Opie, Jimmy had Tits' shitty Charter boat skills on the pay no mind list. Why would you pay even an infants mind to Tit-tanic when you're hanging with your buddies from the club making each other laugh? So, in short notice, Ant is fired and Jim has to sign a buffer deal with Titstink and try to bring some glimmer of comedy. I think it was after the second time his old pals from the show were on. Vos was doing his usual. Riffin' like a babbling lispy lesbian and taking high heat from Jimmy for being and idiot. Then, wait, what's that? Tit-tanic steering his ship into the glacier of comedic potential in the room. It was that moment when our young boy realized signing the deal was wrong. He regretted it instantly. Rightfully thinking that the radio talent he had curated over the past dozen years would be able to shine, he was quick to realize Tits was the John Denver of sea. 

Jimmy starts going on Ant's show, yucking it up and having fun. This makes Tits seethe with jealously, which he doesn't hide well due to blatant narcissism. As the O&amp;J show gingerly moves forward, two bitch boys named Stangle add their weight to the Opie's Noah Ark, while young Sammy boy's moving on signifies the death of Jimmy's fan-beloved characters. Jimmy begins to feel more and more anxious as old friends stop coming around and younger talent that is *all in* with Opie's humorless antics. Jimmy sees what he should have seen all along. That Tits is sucking the comedic nipples of young Pete Davidson dry, just as he had once twerked the nipples of a young James Norton some odd years aboo. 

Now, after today's tirade, Jimmy is consequently engrained further into being the middle man while being between Tits and a jobless hard place. 

So who's the winner here? After a shaky beginning, Anthony seems to be growing a young stable of talent while growing his business model. And, fuck yeah, does that eat at Opie. Or is Opie the winner for sneaking through the back door and faking caring/talent to the tune of millions? Or maybe it's James Norton, who finds him a short while away from being able to focus on stand up, his characters, or Ant's show?

I'm 19/F in my second year at university, financially dependent on my radically religious NMom &amp; NDad, and am quickly reaching my breaking point. I'm planning to move out by the summer, if I can save up enough money from my part-time job, and I have a plan/place to go. 

**background**
NMom and NDad are part of a radical Christian sect that raises children in the same fashion you'd see in documentaries like ""Jesus Camp"" -- no individual identity or purpose in life aside from proselytizing, parental authority equated to God's authority, extreme racism/bigotry/homophobia/misogyny/etc., equating mental illness with satanic possession, you get the drift. I adhered to this mindset throughout my life because I knew nothing else, but was deeply depressed and terrified to disagree or question anything (""defying my parents authority and rebelling against the Lord and choosing a life of sin""). NMom and NDad always bought me nice (expensive) things to try and prove their love for me, but screamed and called me worthless/stupid/""a waste of my entire life"" if I ever failed to meet their constantly-changing and impossibly high standards. This was all well and good until college, where I realized I was gay, liberal, and started a loving relationship with an SO who they hate for unknown reasons (as in, they literally won't provide a legitimate reason to disapprove of the relationship, just rage against me/SO's physical appearances/career choices/life-goals in attempts to tear us both down and apart). I've tried riding it out for a year and a half, but NParents are now confronting me regularly, destroying my mental health/wellbeing, and threatening to cut me off and disown me from the family if I don't ""get right with God."" Here's a quick list of some sh*t that's gone down in the last year alone, to demonstrate the severity of the situation

* When I told them about an eating disorder that they encouraged, NMom laughed in my face and told me I was making it up and just trying to get attention. They sent me back to school two weeks later with a scale. 
* They knew I was suicidal (at one point in the past, not recently - thankfully that is no longer my crucible to bear) and screamed in my face for hours each day for two months, telling me how worthless I was, what a waste of time/money/effort my existence is, and how they hated being around be because I wasn't putting enough effort into being a happy/perfect child.
* ""No one will ever love you like this. You have to be ten pounds thinner (I'm at a healthy BMI) and ten times happier and have ten times better grades (I have a 4.0 in HS and 3.5 in College). Then maybe someone will pity you enough to love you.""
* ""Everyone would be better off if you were dead than if you were gay"" or ""You deserve to die if you don't adhere to this family's, and thus God's, rules/standards/etc.""
* When I spoke about having zero self-esteem, was again laughed at and told I was a waste of NMom's entire life (spent raising me).
* Whenever I go home for a break, whether it be a few days or a few weeks, NParents are nice/sweet/loving for a few hours and then start screaming. It's wildly unpredictable and there's no way to stop it.
* They refused to give me a phone or bank account unless they had complete and total control over it (monitoring my money, which I earned, and going through my text messages regularly). They also try to control my computer usage and internet search history. 
* They constantly question my work ethic and academic drive, even though I'm in an honors program, double-majoring, and have participated in several internships. Getting Bs one semester is considered failure, and will result in loss of all ""privileges"" like privacy (a door to my room), internet use, phone, contact with friends, etc.
* Guilt me into speaking with them about any issues/concerns I have, but then turn against me and use those ""weaknesses"" to tear me down and describe how unworthy I am of their financial support or family blessing or whatnot. 
* Calling/texting me daily, becoming enraged if I do not answer, and demanding to know all the details of my daily routine/interactions/etc. If I leave out any details whatsoever or mess up minutia (a friend's name, a specific time an event occurred) then in their minds I must be lying and hiding something.
* Telling me that I was my NMom's entire career, and if I fail to adhere to her standards, then I'm a failure and she's a failure. NMom is very Type A and cannot tolerate failure on anyone's part.
* Emotionally manipulating me with tears and pleas to ""not tear this family apart."" Tearing the family apart consists of not telling my parents every single detail of my day, trying to deal with mental illness, getting a B on an exam, or not having an eating disorder. 
* I was raised to believe that I, as a child, was a financial investment by my NParents. The condition of my very existence was that I become the child they wanted me to be. If I don't become that child, I don't deserve their love or support (financial or emotional). Everything was conditional, so all of my life was overshadowed by a fear of losing that support because I wasn't religious enough or straight enough or conservative enough or...
* Constantly saying ""I love you"" and insisting that they do everything because they love me (which I believe they do, but their manifestation of that love isn't healthy or good or right). They've tangled themselves so intimately into my self-worth and identity that I feel like a failure without their approval, which is constantly because I live in fear of them finding out my political/sexual orientation and disowning me because of my 'irresponsible and childish and stupid ungodly behavior.'

What I'm getting at is that their abuse isn't physical, it's just psychological and emotional. It doesn't leave any marks, but it's caused me to develop deep depression, anxiety, shame (of sexual assault, of mental illness, of needing help, of not being perfect according to their standards, of not being 'worthy' of their love), and a heavy dose of self-loathing. Dissociation (loss of physical sensation, feeling like I'm separated from my body) is common for days at a time when I go home, and it's continued now that I'm back at school. I can't ask anyone for help because NParents have instilled in me that that means weakness, that no one will love me or stay with me  (except them), that everyone around me is manipulative and evil (except them), that if I ever 'burden' someone with my concerns (or ask them for help) then they'll leave and blackmail me -- I feel stranded and alone, and I'm the only one to blame because I can't. ask. for. help. 

My plan, as I briefly said earlier (so sorry for the length!), is to save money this year and move out by the summer. I'm moving in with SO/friends, applying to FAFSA as an independent, and hopefully completing all the paperwork over the summer so as not to interrupt my college schedule. It seems like a good plan (would love to hear your thoughts on any elaborations I might need), but I get physically sick thinking about how much leaving will hurt NPArents. I love them very much, even though they're destroying me. It doesn't make any sense.

**help?**
Do you have any tips on how to cope with depression caused by NParents? Do you have any thoughts on how to improve/elaborate on my move-out plan? Any words of wisdom/support on how to just fucking survive the next few months (esp. winter break) with them? How can I emotionally detach so I can escape and move on? Is moving out even the right decision, or am I just being a pansy and just try to ride it out longer? Is there a way to tell NParents I love them but their abuse is killing me (is it even worth it to have that conversation)? Really, any advice or thoughts or support would be wildly appreciative - thank you all in advance and I apologize again for the long post."
3v33tk,1,2015-12-01,"M4F --Up for anything! Rule34, Celebrities, Video games, PB.... Take a look! You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3v33tk/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

3v3a14,1,2015-12-01,"M4F -- House of Lies, The Office or Buffy fan? Come on in. Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3v3a14/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!"
3v3eq7,1,2015-12-01,"New poster (22 F, NL/HL) with wonderful SO (21 M, ??) but in a slowly dying bedroom relationship.",hime-brigarron,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/3v3eq7/new_poster_22_f_nlhl_with_wonderful_so_21_m_but/,"I am a fourth year at college, and having been living with my boyfriend of almost two years, for several months. We've been very okay with living together, had a few minor fights or whatnot, but always seemed to resolve things well.

He's been nothing but nice to me, supporting me through tough times, have a lot of interests in common, and he's always been eager to hug, kiss, hold my hand and cuddle me. 

However, I swore that ever since I let him borrow my Xbox 360 from home, it just went downhill. Sex used to happen one-twice a week, sometimes more. Ever since then, I cannot even remember the last time we had sex. Even the time before that.

I sympathized with his gaming tendencies, because he's under a high-pressure semester. His strict father didn't allow him to bring the console because it would distract him, but he ended up having to drop a lot of activities and clubs to help boost his grades. He is expected to get a 3.2 GPA in order to be accepted into the internship program with the government. So, serious shit. Hell, I'm a gamer myself and a Game Design major, I understand games are an awesome outlet to stress and can help build bonds between friends.

I also sympathized that a lot of his friends live far away or graduated as well, and the only time he can talk to them is on Xbox Live. I wake up with him, go to breakfast, meet with him in between classes and chill with him during the nights. So, I see him a lot and this is his time to be independent and alone. Understood.

I've tried leaving him alone during the nights, not bringing up the topic and letting him chose on his own to have sex. On those nights, he stays up until 3-4 am playing video games with his friends, and when I go to bed earlier and turn off the lights, he joins me, wants to cuddle and goes to sleep minutes afterwords.

I tried bringing it up to him. He seemed discouraged and knew it was a problem. He would say that he's pretty busy or ends up being too tired to do so. He would try to initiate after I brought it up, because he felt bad that it was a problem and then, nothing for a long time. At one point, he expressed that sometimes it was too much work on his end. I felt really hurt, but then I tried accepting it by doing more work by positions, more male-oriented positions where women would have to work harder. It worked for awhile but even then, his interest to initiate it died. 

I tried wearing cute sexy clothes, sending him dirty messages, teasing him while he's playing or teasing him during the day. He'd say like ""Oh my"" or ""You're being really dirty."" And that would be that.

I've tried planning days for us to have sex and either he would forget completely or comment that it's ""weird to plan sex out"". In which I either say ""It's better than we do, otherwise it never happens"" or say ""Okay, I will leave that to you and you decide when it's okay to do so."" In which, read the paragraph above.

I tried outright surprising him with a blowjob as he gamed and just being a total angel to him throughout the whole day. He got very flustered and told me he liked it a lot and I was being really nice to him. It went well, but when we decided to shower afterwords, nothing. We cuddled and kissed in the shower and had dorky conversations, but nothing. I know it sounds a little selfish, but every time I gave him a blowjob, he was very eager about making sure I was able to get off as well. Whether this was me masturbating, or him fingering me or something. But the past few times I gave him blowjobs, he'd either go right to sleep, forget about it or just want cuddles.

What is so frustrating is that he and I used to be very sexual. We roleplayed a lot, did kinky shit, and hell, we'd send each other porn all the time. We still send each other porn all the time. Hell, he roleplays sexual conversations online with his friends. It's something he's always done, but I did it too. It wasn't something that bothered me, but it's getting to the point where he is more interested in video games and his sexual roleplays online than acting them out in bed.

What was the most disheartening was I brought up that I was leaving college and graduating in three weeks. The next time we would see each other would be probably a long time, and we were very interested in living together in his home state in the future. However, my birth control only lasted all of this week, all of next week and finals week was my period week. He said ""Well, I don't know how it'll go. I gotta focus on Finals week and I don't think we're going to have the time."" And it was really sad to hear.

It sucks because this boy is so sweet, has done a fuckton for me, has treated me like a queen otherwise, and a sympathize with him on so many levels but goddamn, I'm resorting to fucking fanfiction to get all my frustrations out. I have no idea what to do. I've run out of ideas and I feel sick to my stomach.

When I transfer I will only have engineering specific courses left, and I will be in my third year. 

- How's the engineering courses from your experience?  From what I read, no one likes taking math classes there, was wondering what your thoughts were on the engineering specific ones.

- Are there internships available to aero - space students through the university and/or professors? What would be the likely hood of me getting one with roughly a 3.4-3.5 gpa?

- What's the people generally like around campus? What is roughly the guy-to-girl ratio in the engineering department?  What is the breakdown on the diverse ethnicity makeup in the engineering department? While I don't mind any race/ethnicity, my first university was 90% south Americans on scholarships. So I didn't have anything in common with anyone in my major. 

- Any gaming organizations?  Would be cool to play with others who are similarly skilled and share the same hobbies/passion.

- what calculators can you use in the engineering classes? 

- Tips on parking? I'm going to be commuting from Little Elm, so any tips/hints to insure a parking spot would be great."

I ended up specifically looking for a specific color scheme, remote, Samsung battery, 8 inches, and Bluetooth speakers. 

I wouldn't think of returning it but here's what I would tell myself if I were to do it over again. After rereading it, it's not scientific at all but ask any questions! 

Bluetooth
These are loud! I ended up disconnecting them. For some reason the place where I got this from decided to have a recorded voice announce to the WHOLE WORLD that the bluetooth device is now connecting. Then when it does, ""the Bluetooth device has been-ah connected successfully"". Everyone laughs because even though there's not a made in China sticker the woman has a strong comedic Chinese accent. No matter if my phone is set on the lowest volume setting this woman still announces to the whole world about my Bluetooth status every time I turn it on. 

8 inches
Honestly I haven't had a chance to compare it. I love the style that the typical 8 inches has (transformer style). 

Remote
I bring my board to the office and one of my interns always decides to hop on this. With the remote I can simply lock and unlock it (not sure if it saves on my battery). It's more of a gimmick since the button on the board over rules the remote. I do like that I can set the board on beginner mode easily. Other than that I don't see a use for it. 

Edit: I learned how to put it in a different mode. You turn it on and push the button again. It'll beep. Apparently fly everytime you turn it on it defaults to beginner mode. Honestly for using it around the office I'm okay with beginner mode. The advance mode is a little too quick for my comfort. 

Samsung battery
I asked the company to add a Samsung battery. They charged another $16 for it. I have to say that even though I haven't opened it up yet the battery life is still disappointing. I expected the board to last all day but then again we ride it on and off throughout the day. With all the fakes I don't think it justifies the extra price I paid.

My name is Jack, and I am currently a freshman attending college in Maryland. I am a firm believer in the statement that if you do something you love, you will never work a day in your life. That is why I have decided to completely switch my outlook on life and focus on careers in the eSports industry. This industry has grown exponentially since I first started following it in 2011, and I have since been in love. I have never found something in my life that I am so passionate about, and I do not know if I ever will. eSports as an industry means so much to me that I am willing to dedicate my entire life to it.

What I am mainly asking for is some advice: how exactly do I begin my journey? A vast number of job opportunities at this time rely on bachelors in certain fields, or previous eSports work. Do you think I should shift my major (Computer Science) to something eSports related (Business development, Economics, marketing, etc.)? Or possibly look for internships around the United States hoping to build up a resume for the future?

Any sort of input would be great appreciated. And please, refrain from any sort of negative comments. I just want to love what I do, and live a life time of happiness. "

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K Messenger, skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp. If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

Looking to find some guys/gals who also applied to the internship this year. It's been a couple weeks now and still haven't heard anything back. I checked online and it just says my application is under review. Figure there has to be thousand's of applicants for the position, however I want to see if there are some people in the same boat to bounce ideas and updates off of?

Also, if there is anyone who has applied previous years and knows what's going on please leave a comment. Would love to start up a chat and get a feel for what they're gonna be doing.

As a background, I do have SQL andR Studio experience as well as using the Lahman baseball database.

So after a couple of failed interviews in the past couple of months. I decided to save up for a macbook. Reason being that I'm a computer science student trying to get and internship as a front-end developer. On these phone interviews I was asked the same question:

""Do you have any experience using a Macbook or any apple devices?"" 

To which my answer was ""Other than an iPod I've never had contact with apple devices"". I will agree that this was a dumb and honest answer.

Anyways that was a little back story as to how I came to acquire this macbook.

Here is the model that I got:

Apple MacBook Pro MF840LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop with Retina Display (256 GB)

I figured I need some decent RAM power to handle Netbeans (not that you need alot to run that program). To be honest I think I could've gone with the top tier Macbook Air and be done with it but I needed that Retina Display. 

Anyways I'm getting off point. Are there any pointers you current macbook users have for someone that has never had contact with macbooks?? I mean I'm using it right now as my daily driver but just want to know if there are any shortcuts or walkthroughs.

Thanks"

3v7um9,2,2015-12-02,"Better late than never, sometimes you need a nudge (Reporting in!)",mind_the_gaps,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3v7um9/better_late_than_never_sometimes_you_need_a_nudge/,"First of all, I'd like to say hello to everyone in this community and to acknowledge how mentally driven one must become to reach the goals some of you have already accomplished.

**I'**m 26yo, and as a natural stage of a boys sexual discovery i always masturbated from an early age, but back then it was always normal (in a non compulsive way). 

**A**nyways, things evolved and once i got the portability and everywhere access to the internet, i can recall that i've been addicted to PMO for around 8 years now. And **hopefully** i am now realizing how much it might be ruining my time, my energy.... and in the big picture, my life.

**A**s everyone else, i've always had my own quirks and unique personality traits/features, and despite my excessive gaming habbits, (and PMO whenever i got bored of gaming), i've always managed to get the attention/relationships with the opposite sex without much effort from my end. 

**R**ecently (4 months ago), the 2 years long relationship with my girlfriend ended (mostly I’m to blame), as these 2 “hobbies” might have contributed to it. We lived these 2 years together, in the same house as we were just finishing the college degree, and most of the nights, I would go to bed really late, just so I could pull all-nighters gaming with my palls, and ultimately “Peel the banana” while watching porn before going back to bed. This behaviour, led to some shitty results, as it would drain my energies making me sleep more, therefore skipping some classes and be less productive every day I pulled that routine… and when it came to sexy time with the lady I loved even tho It was always awesome, in the back of my mind i knew all the PMO was holding me back from making it even greater, numbing my sensitivity and the spiritual bond.


**W**ell, fast forwarding a year and half after the start of the relationship, she started getting tired of my lack of interest on stuff, and the love started to wane, when the time came for the college degree to end I struggled to try to keep the flame alive, but ultimately she had already made up her mind she didn’t want to get stuck with me if I did not seem to get my shit together about having a good life. Eventually, after college I scored a pretty awesome internship job on the same town she was doing hers, things went smooth for some time, and I actually thought that this new place would be the perfect opportunity to rekindle the fire, but this time as I was the only one really committed to fix everything back, we parted ways.

**A**t this point i still had one more month on my internship, but I was all by myself with the loss of my SO, so I committed to the fullest of my capacities to the job I had, and in the end it paid off with the highest grade of the entire class and a recommendation letter and job offers(which I declined because at this point I already had other better plans). But this event increased my PMO addiction, after workhours I would loose +/- 2hours to PMO, as I now needed something to fill the gap it was left behind….

**A**fter the internship I was forced to temporarily move back to my parents’ house for 2 months as I had some unfinished business before moving with my plans to do, enough to say, I had plenty of free time and a lot of privacy, so you guess…. 

….**B**ut not a few days ago, I managed to talk with my ex, I made a joke about wanting one of the things I borrowed her back, she then gave me right this long text with: (tl;dr) where she cherished the time she had with me and that she still, cared and liked me and always will. But in the end she said that she randomly already met someone else, who she likes and has to respect…

*That’s when it struck me!**
&gt; She already moved on, and I’m here feeling sad for myself, plotting to get her back….

But that’s when my mind screamed **NO, you’re better than this, you deserve better**, if you want to get the best version of yourself you have to get rid of all the shit that’s futile and make your time count!



**So my immediate actions already have been:**

* deactivating my facebook and every social crap, except for reddit. 
* cutting dramatically on gaming time (2h daily, was around 10h before).
* going out more with friends.
* setting goals on getting the best physical form I’ve ever been.
* Completely halting on Porn and Masturbation, started yesterday to take the 30 days challenge for now, and then extend accordingly.


**I need tips on:**

* Preventing me from watching any Porn;
* Getting through the urges.

------------------------
Well, sorry for the long post, but I needed to set my stuff out there and straight as I don’t really have the courage to tell this to any of my friends. I feel an idiot, for dragging me down with these addictions. I hope you guys can welcome me in here, as of right now I need some clarity in my mind after all these years of bad weather.


TL;DR: I’m addicted to PMO for 8 years, my SO left and already moved on and I need to stop feel sorry for myself. I’m going to try to find my better self this time, no PM 30 days challenge to start. Tips and words of wisdom very welcome.

3v7x5h,1,2015-12-02,"M4F --Up for anything! Rule34, Celebrities, Video games, PB.... Take a look! You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3v7x5h/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

What's strange is while it still has all the original cast, it focuses on the now graduated students of season 9. 

What's even stranger is that I like it!

I had an intense dislike of season 9(the season that never really happened in my book), but I like this series! It feels right!

3v8xr2,1,2015-12-03,M4F: Married Man still seeking just the right delectably dirty penpal,ALilBitOHonesty,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3v8xr2/m4f_married_man_still_seeking_just_the_right/,"As noted in previous posts, I am married, my wife is unaware that I am doing this. It is wrong and I should not be. But that's a bit of the thrill of it, isn't it?

I am seeking long-term penpals who agree with me that, often, everything that's supposed to be bad makes us feel so good. Conversations, be they chats or RPs, should be shot through with dirty talk. It drives me wild and I get none of it at home.

If RP is your thing, I'm game for any number of scenarios, esp if they include shifting power dynamics and some kind of taboo flair. Whether that means a boss and his intern, a parent and his kid's babysitter, teacher and student, incest, two co-workers having an affair behind their partners' backs, priest and member of the congregation, I'm onboard. So, taboos can be age difference, roles that usually forbid sex, being related, cheating or something else. Name it and I'll let you know.

If RP isn't your bag, I also just love talking about sex. Whether that is current or past exploits, fantasies, or something else, I think sex is fascinating and (obviously) exciting and would love to chat with someone who is equally enthusiastic.

Age range, I'm open to, basically, anyone from 18 to, let's say, 48 (15 years younger through 15 years older). More important than the age is the level of filth in the mind. That's what hooks me.

Please don't hesitate to drop a note no matter when you come across this. I'll make every effort to at least reply, even if it seems we are not a good fit.

Thanks in advance. I'm excited to ""meet"" you.

Katie: KILL ME #2

Justin: Prince Pretty or the HeartBreak Kid or The King of Cuteville

Noah: The sarcastic One

Ezekiel: The Zekey One or Zekeyness

Chef: BADASS

Chris: LIAR

Anyway back to the review we begin with a recap and then the intro I always have a problem with these intros you know what the relationships are from 1 second in I know some people like it like that but kind of SPOILER ALERT. Ahhh back in the days were the sharks were new and the challenges were intense ha good times I'm looking at you All Stars. I hate the areas so are shark like scared of....circles? Or something like that and only 1 person doesn't make it in the clear area WHAT IS THE PURPOSE.

All the interns are already dead wow only took 2 episodes. Chef can walk on water you know what that means CHEF IS JESUS he is not God cause my total drama god comes later in the series can you guess who it is? 

(In sport commentator voice) Bridgette is on the podium first, oh a good dismount, she has a good position and a flawless splash what do the judges have to say 10, 10 and 9.8 and what's this her swim suite flew off the third judge changes his vote it's a perfect 30! By good what an event folks. 

Tyler should of died from the fall onto a water thingy true but HE'S A GENETIC FREAK AND HIS GOT A 141 AND TWO THIRDS CHANCE OF SURVIVAL AS FOR THE OTHER TEAM THEY GOT A 8 AND ONE THIRD CHANCE OF WINNING AT BEST! Geoff jumps and I know his hat is glued on but still the Glue Sniffer's hat has superpowers HATMAN HATMAN HATMAN!!!

Eva jumps boring but, what this a rebel is here folks and NO REACTION he is such at rebel he doesn't even scream when he's falling 1000 feet and you know Duncan is such a rebel they say under his mohawk is another fist that flips you off. 

DJ won't jump but an ingrate I mean he should face his fears they're giving him a chance but nope ingrate. This next part is one of my favourite scenes in Total Drama Chris goes to comfort him and DJ is saying how he got his fear Chris then goes on to say and I quote ""That's ok Big Guy unfortunately that's also makes you a chick"" I just love how ticked Chris sounds and how he lashes into the ingrate I don't know why I just love this scene (A review on me says why he loves a moment then say doesn't know why he loves it LOGIC)

WHERE WAS THE ESCALATOR BEFORE!!! Courtney has L-L-L-LAWYERS did you know Courtney is actually a CIT in Training. DAMN YOU IZZY if you just stayed on your team Katie would of died. I HATE YOU KATIE AND SADIE!!! 

Heather and LeShawna are having an argument I kind of think LeShawna is secretly Eminem. (Rap God Parody: Sassy Girl) I'm beginning to feel like I'm a sassy girl, sassy girl all the people from the front what a taste of me, so who thinks their insults are good enough to hurt me, hurt me, they say I rap like a teleporter so call me LeShawna, Shawna but for me to rap like a teleporter must be in the genes got a teleporter in my back pocket. Oops that got off track anyway Prince Pretty Justin looks at himself in a mirror (next episode I swear I'm making a song for Justin) LeEminem throws Heather off the cliff.

The most super good looking piece of gorgeous is saved by the sharks (Give those Sharks a coke). Beth is insulted by Heather I beat she will shake if off (I hate my little cousin makes me listen to Taylor Swift). Ice Skating Fan Trent then jumps and then oh I wonder if Owen will jump not like they showed it IN THE LAST EPISODE.

Owen jumped and we get more filler. And what's pop is it Canadian soda or something. Eva can carry boxes but pushes them anyway what a bad team mate. Ha Katie and Sadie sat on poison ivy that's what they get for messing with the rules of the game. 

Tongue burns aren't a joking matter you know at least 45 people die of tongue burns each year how sad. Heather and LeEminem make up and Lose Yourself move over LeShawna is going to top the charts with Lose My Earrings (Trademark).

Of course the Gophers go to elimination cause Bass have TEAMWORK do it together, teamwork friends forever. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFqhjFrX-z4 (I loved that show when I was younger skip to 0:20 and I don't know how I remember this song or show).

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO why Zekey my boy don't be sexist you know in this day and age it's a death wish I remember I was a bit sexist once and I still have the scars from when that lady attacked me. Ah this is another reason I hate Katie and Sadie suddenly they're bitter and also THEY GOT MY BOY ZEKE OUT I just realised if Katie and Sadie never voted for Zeke that means Zeke could of won and that also means he might of not gone insane thanks a lot Katie and Sadie.

The Rebel Duncan gives Zeke advice about the real world you know Duncan is such a rebel he gave the Godfather a negative review. Anyway we all knew Zeke was going and it just brings a tear to my eye to see the first stop on the road to insanity for my boy Zekey and his Zekeyness. 

This episode wasn't as good as episode one it was slow and could get a little boring so for my final score

7/10

Good Things: Character Development 

Good Challenge

Owen being Owen

Negatives: Slow

Too Predictable

Zeke's Eliminated

Next Episode will involve: Poochy References, LeEminem's Lose my Earrings, Justin song, Katie and Sadie hate and another depressing Owen story thanks everyone

3v9ab4,9,2015-12-03,I need to get this off my chest. My story and reasons to quit,bromodfly,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/3v9ab4/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest_my_story_and/,"Hi r/StopGaming,

I feel like I have to write this, so bear with me. I hope that this can possibly help someone.

My gaming started when I was a child. My parents were great, and they helped me keep a balance with it (even when I didn't want to). Around the time I turned 14/15 I quit playing video games - because I started doing drugs. Just smoking a little weed at first, and this escalated into rehab, hospital overdoses, arrests... pretty much everything bad that could have happened.

I'm writing this because I feel video games are just as addictive for me as the cocaine I was addicted to for 3 years.

Now I'm going to take a step back. I quit doing as many drugs (though I partake more often than I would like, especially cigarettes), but my life is great now. I've made all A's in university as a science major for 2.5 years. I'm on a full scholarship plus stipend, and I've been lucky enough to get internships and other opportunities. I started my own business while still in school which is surprisingly much more successful than I would have thought. My parents and I are on great terms. I have many friends, and I am very outgoing. Perhaps the best thing about me is my girlfriend, who is far better to me than I deserve. She is absolutely wonderful.

I started playing DotA 2 on September 21st, and I've logged around 150 hours in those 72 days, with the majority being the past 2 weeks (played 70 hours). This may not seem like a lot to some of you guys (and I'm not trying to say it is), but the thing that frightens me is that I recognize my addiction in this game. I've been here before with drugs. The only thing I care about is one more game (hit). It doesn't matter what else is happening around me. I dream about it. When I can't play anymore and decide to cut myself off for the night, I end up watching streams or pro matches on youtube for another 2 hours. I've made the worst grades I've ever made this semester. I may be able to come back with finals coming up, but I may not.

This addiction is terrifying to me. With cocaine, my nose hurts and I can't do anymore. I'll willingly fall asleep and save it for tomorrow. Not with DotA. DotA doesn't physically hurt me. DotA doesn't make my nose bleed. DotA doesn't cost money. DotA isn't a ""serious"" addiction. DotA isn't illegal. DotA won't ruin my life. DotA won't ruin my life.

**DotA will ruin my life, if I keep going.**

Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating. My life is great, and in truth, the things that I have sacrificed to DotA are little right now, but I am terrified of gaming. Even if I keep playing DotA, I'll still probably make money, keep my girlfriend happy, and fulfill my purpose in life. But even then, I know I won't be the best person I can be, at the sacrifice of being a better player. I fear I will wake up in ten, twenty, thirty years with a mediocre life. I wouldn't be happy with 7 kills and 7 deaths, why would be happy with the equivalent real life score?

Drugs and DotA both trap you. That feeling of ""I lost... I need to play another to redeem myself"" and ""I won!... Play another to continue the streak"" is the exact same thing as ""This cocaine is good, I'll do more"" or ""This cocaine is not good, I need to buy and do more to feel it"". No matter what, you're a slave. You are not making your own decisions anymore. Your brain has been hijacked and you are incapable of making rational decisions anymore; this is addiction. It is the same addiction. 

I want people to know from this that it is a serious problem, and that this devil is doing pushups every second, waiting for you to fail, waiting for you to reinstall. Do not give in.

PM me if you want to talk or vent to me anonymously. Talking about your addiction really helps get over it, if for no other reason than being able to organize your feelings on the topic in a logical way. 

Thanks for reading. 

**tl;dr DotA may not be as bad as crack but they're pretty much the same thing**"
3v9vjq,2,2015-12-03,Button to automate creation of an item in a list and a custom view in another Sharepoint 2007,Mrducktape,sharepoint,https://www.reddit.com/r/sharepoint/comments/3v9vjq/button_to_automate_creation_of_an_item_in_a_list/,"Hello, I'm an intern who's been asked to create something to monitor orders, clients, products... in a SHAREPOINT 2007 environment. I have no idea of how this thing works, so I've been looking for the past week and I've come up with what I think could work.

I have 5 lists so far, Clients, Orders, Order, Products and Suppliers. Some of the columns in this lists are linked and trigger some workflows and whatnot. So far I've managed to overcome the limitations of not having full control over the site and working with SharePoint 2007 in general.

However I am now stuck and don't know how to proceed with what I'm trying to achieve. 

In my list ""Order"" I keep all of the items that are required for a order, the quantities required, etc... My plan is to create views or filter them somehow. (I've found [this](""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/cc300163(v=office.12).aspx"") but the result is not as good as creating a custom view).

I'd like to somehow automate the following tasks clicking a button:

* Launch NewForm in a list (Orders).
* When the item is created I want to create a new custom view in another list (Order), showing only the items that contain a certain field in a certain column, which is a lookup containing the names of the items in the first list Orders.
* Editing one of the columns (""single line of text"") in the item created in the first step with the hyperlink to the view.
I have no idea how to proceed, what or where I should look into in order to solve this. Can you please point me into the right direction?"
3vagqe,6,2015-12-03,Contact with the grandparents without the parents?,anonymoosepika,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3vagqe/contact_with_the_grandparents_without_the_parents/,"My grandparents have moved into town from out of province. They're lovely people, but they believe in family with a capital F. I know they don't have too many years ahead of them, and I desperately want to spend time with them - I just don't want my mother to be there. She's been calling a bunch to try and ""facilitate"" my seeing them. (When are you going? Are you even going to go? Do you know that Hannukah's coming up soon? You should go for the candle lighting ceremony. I'm calling for them; they have trouble using the phone.)

I told her I can make plans with them on my own, thank you very much, and she doesn't have to stick her nose in it. It's leaving a rather sour taste in my mouth.

I'm super uncomfortable being around or talking to her... She acts like there's no reason for things to be strained between us after she tried to guilt me into breaking the law for her, then threatened to kick me out - and when I started packing quickly got on her knees (literally) and started begging for me to stay and help her. This followed by renditions of ""you're a bitch, you're throwing me to the wolves!"" and the like.

She later apologized and told me it's probably better for me to live somewhere else (after two weeks of homelessness I found a place with my boyfriend and two of his friends for cheap rent) and told me she'd still give me allowance every month until I'm back on my feet.

I'm 23, I have a B.F.A., and I suffer from pretty debilitating clinical depression. The years of gaslighting and being called lazy probably haven't helped. I'm in a government program now following a few months of internships, and I'm currently waiting on my job developer to help me find a paid placement. I did more work than anybody else during the training portion of the program and have done a lot to generate leads with potential employers and networking contacts... But I'm really exhausted now and super down about the whole thing, between prepping for interviews and applying for disability support.

I'm in therapy and on medication and I'm really hoping this particularly low point passes. I've been crying a lot and feeling rather helpless.

Now, the allowance doesn't actually come from my mother. My mother's spent the last few years making almost nothing with a company called ACN - more like a cult than a business opportunity if anything. The money really comes from my stepfather's spousal support during their year-long divorce proceedings that have zero end in sight.

I've had one phone conversation with him in the past year. For all his faults, he's repentant and supportive. But of course, he can't give me anything directly without risking my mother taking him back to court, so it's rather a moot point. And I'm still pretty hurt that the first time I've heard from him since last December was only a fortnight ago.

So obviously, her saying ""I'll still support you!"" is more like, ""I'll still pass on what your stepfather's been putting aside for you rather than taking it for myself - like I've done with your sister for the past year!"" Which is honestly shit I'm really not supposed to know.

I just want to see and spend time with my grandparents without the constant guilt trips and outright lies... I'm just so tired. What do I do? Must I suck it up or is there another option I'm not seeing here?"
3vaw16,1,2015-12-03,Is this job fair?,j_ker,dubai,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/3vaw16/is_this_job_fair/,"My friend finally got a job after searching for months, as a software developer. This person graduated with bachelors and masters from two different and expensive universities. He already worked for 1 year at another company as an intern. However this time, he again could only manage to be an intern at the job, with 2500 AED monthly, full time, in Dubai. Does this seem fair to anyone? The money he spent for his studies alone is considerable. All he said was that it was a reputable company. I feel that they are underpaying someone with such qualifications and experience. 

EDIT: Thanks for the reply, guys. I really appreciate it. I will try my best to talk some sense into the guy. "

""I used to intern for those guys,"" I always think to myself. ""They haven't done anything crazy in like, 20 or 30 years at least"". I keep understanding what's going on and what everyone's talking about and then reforgetting the second I get off the computer, only to be met by more confusion the next time I come across it.

The BLM might get shit for its history of mining and oil and all that, but there are good people working there. You guys should support them.

I would see in the finder on the left hand of a folder a network folder called ""Interns"" I would click it and be able to access all the stuff in it. 

Suddenly, that folder doesn't appear anywhere. Nothing changed but the day. It doesn't seem to be a problem for anyone else.

From Comments:
""I was raped and druged by a monster that I was dating he was from Iraq came to Canada as a refugee.. Not only he told me they are going to cause world war 3 but that people are stupid in Canada and America... U give them a car walkie talkie and they drive cabs\ taxis at anytime they can hit anything and we would pay the gas to get there ... He also told me that back where he came from Iraq he seen his mother raped his friends leg from being blown up that's all was left.. He seen dead babies body's ppl of all ages dead by Americans and that this war killed 2millions of them and that revenge is all they want to take from us here to give karma and revenge.. To them we are an infidels ... I was druged by my food so that I would be raped by his friends ... They all walk free now and I was am not the first girl they do this to there are others rose Pope and more ... I'm a born and raised Canadian and I tried to put them away not only my government let me down in a victim impact statement was bullshit ... I live in housing for my protection when I've seen him on my street ... So because his country is in war there is no deportation but what they have done to me will for ever be there some days are better some all I do is cry.. I've joined groups for women with women ... And one on one psychiatry.. They beat and burned my body I have marks and scars u can see and ones u can not see.. I met a American we married and had a baby I'm waiting to move to America.. This country has let me down.. Only the guy got 3 years the rest got away ... But when they do this again don't call me like I told the courts its ur problem not mine. These ppl mind has been broken they seen so much death war rape their house being blown up family friends the same or worse .. They are broken hurt consumed with pain suffering that intern it comes out in anger or aggression and revenge they need psychological professional help.. The guy that did this came to Canada when he was 3 now he is in his 30 like me ... But u know what u will do what u want and put ppl that are innocent at risk... Shame on those that do.. Cuz he was right Canadians are stupid and very trusting so let them all in even isis who cares this war was caused by bush and ppl that profited after oil... Now I see it's all krama in the end u get what u asked for and then put it on the news like its new ? Well u see it's not and most of them want u , us to pay for what we have let happen to them cuz we don't care we killed 2,million of ppl from their land. Women and children and more that were not part of a war like me but now I have two choices get back or forgive and I choose forgive .. I forgive them but I think this is wrong... They need help and alot of it the mind is broken so is the heart... U can't being this onto population when they are looked and charged by the majority...They should be watched and told to get help someone to talk to most of them suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder with more this is a problem .. They need to understand forgiveness love compassion serenity law abiding citizens... They are on a state of war many of them all there lives u can't being that to population and expect them to act appropriately it's ludicrous... Face the facts or more law suits will happen as I did Sue the the system for this... Is what it is ... God bless and take care..."""
3vbvwk,0,2015-12-03,Questions about DU training next month,b4_intern,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3vbvwk/questions_about_du_training_next_month/,"I'll be attending DU next month for training for my winter internship and was just wondering if anyone could answer some of these questions


-How much clothes should I bring with me? Do they do laundry there or do I pack enough to last me the two weeks? As well as how many different shoes and pants? And are suits needed or just dress shirts?

-DU is at like a farm/barn, will I be there the whole time or would we travel to nearby cities and stuff too? Is the place exciting or boring?

-I will have a roommate, is it someone from the city I will be interning at (Dallas) or can it be anyone from around the country?

-How bad does it look if I hook up with other interns? I heard a lot of people hook up during training but does it look down upon from the seniors or does no one actually care what you do?

-Anything else I should know about training? I haven't received the schedule yet so not sure exactly what I'll be doing but is it typically like taking classes 8-6 and then free time after and weekends are off days? 

Thanks."
3vcncr,18,2015-12-03,"[Request] [F4F] ""Why didn't you stop, Mommy? Why did you hurt me?"" [incest] [mother/daughter] [rape] [starts out consensual] [strap-on] [ignoring pleas to stop] [overwhelming guilt] [begging forgiveness] [bleeding] [depressing as fuck]",johnboy3434,gonewildaudio,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildaudio/comments/3vcncr/request_f4f_why_didnt_you_stop_mommy_why_did_you/,"My mind went to another dark place, and this skeletal scenario was the result. It sort of tapers off by the time the sex begins, because the muse randomly decided to fuck off. I put F4F in the title because the character being spoken to is female (the performer would be playing the mother), but since I am decidedly not female, I make no claim of accurately depicting lesbian lovemaking. Or heterosexual lovemaking, for that matter. Or lovemaking that involves dogs and/or Yoda from *Star Wars*.

Life as a single mother isn't exactly easy, doubly so when you're a lesbian, but you've managed to make do. Your successful law practice is testament to your fortitude, perseverance, and professionalism. But above all that, your greatest treasure is your 18-year-old daughter. You've always felt that she saved your life. Before she was born, your life was... different. You try not to think about it too much, lest you begin to miss it. You did things you weren't proud of. The alcohol. The drugs. The partying. The sex. Lots and lots of sex. Yeah, your heart has always lusted after your own gender, but when you're washing down a second hit of molly with a bottle of Jack and you're already eating out that cute little redhead in the middle of the dance floor, the lines can get a little blurred. One night, they got blurred enough that, nine months later, you got a blonde, blue-eyed, seven-pound wake-up call.

The urge to go back, to take a drink, to pick up a girl who looked like the kind of trouble you didn't need but desperately wanted, it was almost undeniable. Then you just looked at her, the light of your life, the center of your world, and you found the strength to let those opportunities pass by.

And today, she's 18. That's not possible. In a couple months, she's leaving you. That's terrifying. But like all parents, you bear it with a straight face. After the requisite birthday dinner (honestly, the girl loves Olive Garden more than can possibly be healthy), it's back to your penthouse apartment for presents. A laptop for studying (yeah, right), a sweater with the university logo on it, a comprehensive history of the football team that she'll be obligated to root for. You know, the essentials.

Then comes one of those moments. You'd seen it often enough: she wants to tell you something, but she's afraid. This time, you have a pretty good idea. Throughout high school, you've always asked if there was anyone she was sweet on, but the answer was always a rather flat ""no"". But, it was the kind of ""no"" that spoke volumes. The kind of ""no"" that you remember having to give your parents whenever they asked you. You break the ice yourself, ""You're gay, aren't you, sweetie?"" You give her a reassuring smile. The girl nods, but the tension doesn't dissipate. You try to alleviate it with some small talk concerning her sexuality. What attracts her, etc. She says she prefers older women. You become concerned. Did one of her teachers ever try to—she cuts you off. Nothing like that happened. It's just something she noticed about her desires as she grew up. You ask her, not as her mother, but as her friend, if she ever had a secret girlfriend. She meekly responds, ""no"".

Finally, she can't stand beating around the bush any longer: ""Will you be my first?"" A cannonball flying through the window couldn't have knocked you off your feet any harder than that question did. She immediately launches into a confession of love and admiration. You're the perfect woman. You're everything she wants to be. You're everything she wants to have. She never fooled around with anyone, even when one of the cheerleaders hinted that she was up for it. She was saving herself. Saving herself for the woman who deserved to be her first. For you.

She knows that you've never had a girlfriend since she was born. You were too focussed on her needs to satisfy your own. Now you can do both, she says. Her confession is starting to evolve. This isn't just about popping her cherry. This is about the future. Long-term. It's not like she looks just like you. She got all of her looks from her father (whoever he was), so you could actually go out, she says. Like, as a couple. In the Olive Garden, she fantasized that other people were looking at the two of you, figuring that some little tart had found herself a sugar mama. Whenever you visit at college, she could introduce you as her girlfriend. Maybe, after a few years, she could even introduce you as her wife. As long as you're out of town, no one has to know that you're not actually married, and behind closed doors, it could be truth in all but name.

Your brain is fried. Your long-dormant libido is starting to see an unacceptable amount of sense in her proposition. This has to stop now. Then you see the eagerness in her eyes, the sincerity of her plea. The love, the unbridled love. Don't do it. You lean forward. Don't do it. Your hand caresses her cheek. For the love of God, don't do it. You do it. Your lips meet, and you pounce like the cougar you apparently are. Your daughter is pinned to the couch in seconds. Your hands are everywhere. Clothing is gone. Your daughter is overwhelmed. Beyond words. This wasn't what she expected.

You lower your face to her virgin pussy, and it's like riding a bicycle. Soon your daughter is bucking against your face, speaking words that might have been English in her mind but come out as pleading gibberish. She's too fuckdrunk to stand, so you pick her up. You carry her across the threshold, to your bed, throwing her confused frame down onto it. You start rummaging through drawers, trying to find... it. Your favorite instrument of pleasure. Mr. Shock-and-Awe, you call it, for the reaction girls always had when they saw it. If your daughter wants to lose her virginity, she's going to get what she wants, in spades. Time to bring Mr. Shock-and-Awe out of retirement.

As you strap it around your waist, memories come flooding back. The club. The drugs. The alcohol. The cute redhead that, nine months later, you named your daughter after. In your drug-addled mind at the time, she was the one that got away. Your daughter looks less confident than she did when this started. In fact, she doesn't look confident at all. She looks scared. That look on your face is something she's never seen before. The lust, burning so intensely. And that thing between your legs. You can't be serious. As you pin her arms to the bed and smother her mouth with yours, she knows you're serious.

She screams into your mouth as you ram home. Eighteen years of repression come rushing back to you. Everything you've wanted, you take it. You're not fucking your daughter. You're fucking the cute redhead on that date you canceled because you woke up with your first bout of morning sickness. You're fucking that grad student who invited you out for drinks on graduation day. You're fucking the fellow intern who invited you into a storage closet for a little stress-relieving session. You're fucking your secretary, because you're the boss now and she does whatever the fuck you tell her to do. You're fucking that working girl with impeccable gaydar who strolled up to your window while you were at a red light. You're fucking all of them, fighting to keep them in place, catching them again when they slip past your grip and slapping them with all your might to let them know you aren't finished yet. Your orgasm is a supernova behind your eyes. You waited almost two decades to feel this again, and now you have it. You have it for the rest of your life, with a woman who will always love you.

As the light fades, her face comes back into view, and your heart freezes in your chest. Your daughter's lip is busted and swollen. She's crying her eyes out, her voice an incoherent litany of ""Please stop"", ""No more"", and ""It hurts"". You back off, a scream coming from your daughter as Mr. Shock-and-Awe pulls free. You look down, and you want to kill yourself. That isn't just a smattering of virginal blood. It's a pool. The sheets are saturated in the center. And the pool is still growing. She's still bleeding. Moving as quick as she dares, she crawls away from you, the blood forming a trail, to the far side of the mattress, where she curls into a ball.

You're paralyzed. You need to call an ambulance, but how are you going to explain this? You try to get closer to her, but she yelps and flails her arms to keep you away. ""No more"", she says. You immediately divest yourself of the bloody strapon, but it doesn't help. ""Why didn't you stop? I yelled to stop, that were hurting me. Why did you hurt me?"" these questions are all you can make out through the sobs. You try to inspect the damage, but as soon as you reach between her legs she fights to keep you away.

You try your best to soothe her, but it won't work. She doesn't trust you. Your baby, the little one that always depended on you, doesn't trust you. You hurt her. You betrayed that trust. You raped her. The word is like a further punch to the gut. You're the most disgusting trash on Earth. She trusted you to show her the pleasures of making love, and now for all you know you've hindered her ability to ever do it again.

No time for that now. You need to help her. One last time. Then you need to decide where you're going: prison, or out your apartment window. Does it matter? You're going to Hell, anyway."

As said above, I'm a third year geophysics student at the University of South Carolina.  I have experience with Petrel, Landmark ProMax seismic processing software, QPS-Qimera bathymetry software, Matlab, and the python coding language.  

I've put many, many hours into interpreting seismic reflection profiles throughout my geophysical courses, and would consider myself rather adept for an undergraduate.

I work as a research assistant for a distinguished professor here at USC, where I am using QPS-Qimera to process and interpret side-scan sonar, CHIRP, and acoustic backscatter data.  Our end goal is the classification of the South Carolina continental shelf for future development of wind energy.  

I am looking for a paid internship for the Summer of 2016 preferably in the O&amp;G or bathymetry geophysics research areas, but I would be open to absolutely any kind of opportunity outside of those areas as well.  I would be open to traveling anywhere in the United States and possibly Canada.  

Thanks for reading! If there are any questions whatsoever about my experience or any more details please feel free to private message me and we can talk more.  "

I am a recent university grad majored in Computer Science looking for a job in the tech industry. It's been a few months, and I haven't found a job yet. 


**About her**:

She is an intelligent/smart European student, who recently finished her undergrad and continuing her studies in a Master's program. 


**How we met**:

We teamed up at a tech company's hackathon event. We successfully built the application. Although, we did not win the competition, we were really happy we built it. 


**What happened then**:

After the hackathon, she actively started messaging me. I liked her too, so I asked her out. We had a great first date. At the end of the date she kept asking about my job, and I felt really uncomfortable answering her questions about it. She went back to Europe and started her internship with a reputed tech company. 


**The problem now**:

When she was going I decided that I will find employment and then contact her. So I messaged her saying if I get a job I will let her know. Fast forward a few weeks, she messaged me again telling how excited she is starting the internship and asked me about my job again. She seemed supportive in the chat. I really want to chat with her and know how she is managing stuff out there. I really care for her, and think of her every single day, but I am stopping myself from contacting her. I feel embarrassed about contacting her when I am unemployed. 


What should I do? Is it ok to talk to her now in this situation ? or should I hold myself out until I get a job? 


Am I being a nice guy, who is hiding his flaws and displaying avoidant behavior? Does it fit the equation? [This is for those who have read 'No more Mr. Nice guy' book]

   
**tl;dr**: 

I recently graduated and am looking for a job. She is interning at an awesome company. I feel embarassed to talk to her because of my unemployment. Should I talk to her or not?

3vd97a,1,2015-12-03,"M4F --Up for anything! Rule34, Celebrities, Video games, PB.... Take a look! You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3vd97a/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

Choosing Houston over the 3 programs we have in Florida because of all the things Ive read about UH as a whole, just wanted to get a bit more info on the CM program in particular.  Really want to gather as much insight as possible ahead of my planned visit to campus next month.

-Whats your impressions of the CM program as a whole?  Is it what you expected?  Have you enjoyed it?

-How would you rate the professors in the program?  Have they been helpful, and easy to understand?

-Do you feel that UH has prepared you for the construction industry?  (I long ago switched majors from architecture, in hopes of a more well rounded education of the whole industry)

-What have you heard about the internships?  Good?  Bad?


Thanks everyone!  Looking forward to joining yall in fall 2016!"

Been at the same company as an intern throughout college, and full time 3 years post graduation. I'm interviewing with one of the big dogs next week and feeling confident i'll be a good fit. The role would require me to move to a rural area on the otherside of the country, where I won't know anybody. I grew up in a rural area, so that's only a minor concern.
Since I've never switched major jobs before, i'm hoping somebody can help me weigh pro's/con's before/IF I end up with an offer.
Cons of current job:
*My team's dynamics suck, boss is a 'yes' man who avoids all conflict. 
*very uneven workload among the team, as in 20% of the team does 90% of the work while management refuses to address the issue. 
*Very silo'd role - not much chance of moving out of my current team in the future, but i could still get one to two more promotions before 'peaking' in my role. 
*I'm salaried with a 48 hour work week minimum requirement (no overtime pay). Typically work 48-52 hours a week, plus on-call duties every 5 weeks. No bonuses.
Pro's of current job:
*flexible schedule. 
*Yearly raises are typically significant. 
*Good environment to learn. 
*Family/friends in current city. 
*Can travel once a year to a conference, such as F5 Agility or Cisco Live. Am currently in a more Senior position.
Pros of potential new job:
*One of the biggest tech companies on my resume.
* Environment to expand my existing knowledge significantly.
* Pay would increase. Serious step forward for my career. New part of the country to explore (in US).  
Cons of potential new job:
*no friends/family in new place. 
*All the unknowns with taking a new job and moving across the country
So, with all that said, is there anybody in/were in a similar position? What was your experience in moving across the country? What you would do?"

Right now my start date has not been determined, but I was just wondering what the options are. I looked at what other redditors have posted and it seems that it's either August, September or October. However, I've heard from someone that a June start date is also possible. I am choosing MSA classes for my 150, so I want to know how much leeway I can have next semester to get the exam done as well. Could anyone share their experience? Thank you in advance!!!"
3ve5fm,7,2015-12-04,"I [30F] have been with my bf [29M] for nearly a decade. His depression has worsened, now dealing with bipolar, adhd diagnosed in the last year. I feel like I'm being dragged down and drowning myself, but don't know what to do for him or me anymore.",the_crows_care_not,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ve5fm/i_30f_have_been_with_my_bf_29m_for_nearly_a/,"I've (30F) been with my bf Sam(29M) (name changed) for nearly a decade. We met in a time where we were still exploring who we were, and as time has gone on, we've matured and grown together. In the beginning we would go to concerts, music festivals, camping outings, long drives just to go, etc. These weren't things that he would be jumping for joy to do, because #1, he's not that kind of guy, and #2 he's dealt with depression since his teens. Over the years the outings have pretty much stopped, and it's like pulling teeth to get him to do anything, even watch a movie at home, go out to lunch, go grocery shopping, etc, with me. If we do go do anything, I **always** foot all the bills.


As of December last year he graduated college after 9 years (part and then full time), with a degree in education, but scored too low to get the certification. Given two choices he chose to not retake the 6 month internship, and at the time the plan was to be a substitute for a while. That never happened. He said school had made him miserable, and that he absolutely regretted getting his teaching degree. Instead he decided to stay home. Then he decided to try to do some ebay and amazon selling to bring in more money, as I was footing all the bills and going into debt to keep us afloat. 

In April during a fight (about bills and money) he threatened to hurt himself. At the time it was decided he would not go into intake at the crisis center, but within a week he chose to go that route, feeling it was best for him. Since then he's been diagnosed as bipolar, on top of his depression and adhd. He got set up with  a dr. and counselor, and takes loads of meds to deal with his various issues. 

The online sales helped to pay some bills, but I was still handling the majority. We would get into constant fights about this. Then his father passed after a long illnesss in August. Since then Sam has been steadily getting worse. Changes in meds either don't work, or the dr changes them before they have a chance to. Sam's mom (also our landlord) stepped in to try to help us. Sam is due an inheritance sometime soon from his father's side of the family. She paid me back all the bills I'd paid for Sam, and then when he gets the inheritance, he will pay her back out of it. So the financial issues for the moment are handled.

But I feel like I am over my head here. I myself work full time, and am a part time student. I don't know what to do for him anymore. He stays at home all day everyday doing a little of the online sales some days. Other days he just plays video games or sleeps. Usually when I come home he will announce that he did a load of laundry, or switched the dishes out of the dishwasher, as if waiting for a round of applause. I feel like an asshole. I know on one level that so much of what he deals with is the depression and meds. On another level I feel like saying ""I just came home from 8 hours of work, and will put in another 3 or 4 doing homework, but yeah! Great job doing the dishes!! /s"". I know that these achievements are probably huge for him somedays, but I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one doing anything. I feel like I am dragging him through life to keep on, one day at a time. I am exhausted. Our sex life is at a minimum, as I generally have a lower libido and him higher, as well as him gaining a sizeable amount of weight lately. I don't feel sexually attracted to him this way. With the always down attitude, no motivation, general unhealthiness, and me taking on the brunt of ""real world"" duties to keep us going, I feel like I have a dependent rather than an equal partner, and like I'm just a cash cow.

I've thought about breaking it off, but I'm scared of what he would do to himself, and I'm scared of being alone. Great reasons to stay together, right? I love him, but I don't know if I can mentally, emotionally, or physically deal with this anymore. I feel like I'm being dragged underwater, trying to gulp breaths of air. The deeper I get pulled under, the more I feel this intense pressure on my chest like the breath I'm holding onto is burning my lungs. I myself deal with huge amounts of daily stress and anxiety, but I've always been the one to get shit done. Lately I'm finding that I need help, and I don't feel like I will ever get it.

I don't know what I expect from anyone reading this, but I just had to get all this off my chest. 

tl;dr. longterm bf has depression, bipolar, adhd. I feel like I'm drowning in the various burdens I must shoulder. Help."
3ve68z,4,2015-12-04,I have created my first app to get an internship. Now I need your advices for the code and the app,Foushi,androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3ve68z/i_have_created_my_first_app_to_get_an_internship/,"Hi, I was looking for an internship in Android App. So to learn and understand Android. I've decided  to create my own app and understand basic best practise of Android. So here is my project :
https://github.com/jfabri63/ClothsWeather
So at first I force the user to choose a city in the autocomplete view using Google Autocomplete API. I get the GPS coordinate with another API.
Then the user choose how much time he wants to go out and with openweather API I get the weather with GPS coordinate. In the second fragment I suggest the user how he should dress according to the temp.

I'm planning to add more extensions to learn more aspect of android programming. So if you have suggestion about what I can add in a special way that could help me to discover new parts of Android programming it would be cool.
By the way I'm using volley libraire to send request and EventBus to pass data between fragment. I don't know if these libraries are ""good practise"" but I found pretty good review on the internet.

So if you have suggestion about my code ( I know it's a bit ugly) and extensions that I could add. I'm happy to hear it.

I've been stuck in a depressive mental rut lately and it's just been bothering me. Do you guys ever feel ugly about your skin color/ethnicity? I have been, since most of the girls around me are white, beautiful, and I've just been feeling hopeless. It sucks just walking out the door that a good number (not all, I can't say that, but realistically it's a sizeable portion) of them won't think of me that way due to something that I can't change about myself. I figured out awhile ago that I couldn't conform to society's standard of a good looking white guy, no matter how hard I tried. I see it within my race, how lighter skin color is valued and desired way more than darker skin color. I'm not that dark, but I'm noticeably brown, and I just don't know how else I can own it more being one of the few brown people in a big campus of pretty white folks. Aside from my physical stature (5'9 ~200lbs) It seems like I've just been losing steam and effort with girls. I'm getting back into lifting and dieting (myfitnesspal and cutting down on eating out), so I can't just blame it all on my skin color. I know how much exercise can lift your confidence and yourself, and I truly do value that. I realize the power it has and have been utilizing it more. Yet, I've just been feeling hopeless and my self-confidence is internally collapsing, even though I don't want it to. I've never been too successful with girls (20 years old, never had a gf) but I've been trying around. Getting involved, going out, meeting new people, people seem to love me as a friend! My phone isn't constantly blowing up with invites, but I get to go out and see people and I do have a life. People find me funny! People like me! But, it's like no girl likes me the way I want them to, and after awhile, I think that I'm becoming a bit numb to it. I know I'm not supposed to give up, and I don't want to, but I just wish that I was white sometimes. It gets tough being alone and seeing others with their girl/s. I don't even think I'm just after sex, but I just want some intimacy. Some companionship. I've never had a sober kiss before, or a girl find me attractive in a long time. It's like I'm trying to dig myself out of loneliness, but I'm not making progress. I can't blame it all on my skin color, and a lot of it does have to do with my attitude, diagnosed anxiety and depression as well. Depression and anxiety have gotten so bad to the point where i did something really shameful and regretful about a year and a half back. I lost my virginity to a prostitute. It wasn't good, I did it out of desperation and I felt disgusted with myself. What's worse is that I did it again when I had a small nervous breakdown episode about the same issue. I have nobody but myself to blame for that, and I accepted it and moved on from it. Since then, I've been having good streaks of confidence and happiness since finding myself more in college, which does make me really happy, but I just don't want to become a 21 year old without much or any experience/good history. I've become more successful as a person, student, and future workforce member by finding my passion in a good major and locking down some internships, but don't think/feel that I've personally succeeded. I've made my family and myself proud, but there's still a lot to answer for. I feel mature enough to truly have sex and engage in a relationship because I have a better understanding of myself and others than I did back then, but it's been a tough and lonely journey on the inside. I just want some good memories, that's all. I know I have to make them, but this time it takes 2 to make this type of memory and it isn't looking like it'll happen anytime soon. I just don't want to spend another year without at least some contact, a good pick-me-up or confidence boost from a girl. I don't like how hairy I am, or my skin tone. I know this was a rant with a huge personal tangent, but I've just been feeling bad lately about what I've become. I've been tossing and turning in my sleep, retreating to porn, and I'm afraid of how it'll last long term."
3vecnw,2,2015-12-04,"It's been an entire month, but it hasn't gotten easier.",throwaway91234478098,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3vecnw/its_been_an_entire_month_but_it_hasnt_gotten/,"I followed all of the general advice. I hit the gym, I focused on myself, I drag my body out the door once a week to go hang out with people and distract myself, so why is it that I can't stop thinking about you?

I should have known a month prior when I went well out of my way to see you for a weekend. We met up briefly on Saturday, which was nice, and had planned to spend all of Sunday together. I was waiting for you for 30 minutes when you finally told me that your ride wanted to visit a friend and you wouldn't be able to make it. Never in my life had I felt so betrayed. The biggest red flag was that you didn't even attempt to contact me or apologize You just tried to defer the blame and pretend it never happened. I was livid and was absolutely determined to end things there, but a few cute snapchats, a few days of non-stop texting and two days spent together the next week and I had practically forgotten all about it. 

It was long distance, you said that was the reason it didn't work out. You said it had nothing to do with the guy you had recently became best friends with and spent more time with than you did with me. The guy who you know is in love with you. The guy who sang and played your favorite song to you on his guitar one night. The night you lied to me about what happened because you were too *nice* and didn't want me to feel bad about it because ""it meant nothing"".

In the weeks leading up to the breakup. You started becoming more and more distant, and I started blaming myself. Drowning in my insecurities, I worked to try to be the best possible person I could be for you. I thought that every problem in our relationship stemmed from my inadequacy, and that I had to become better to keep it together. I could see everything crumbling, and I asked time and time again what you wanted. If you wanted it to end, I was prepared for that. But whenever I prodded, you were so *nice* and said ""You're fine"" and that I had nothing to worry about, as if you didn't see the walls crashing down around us.

After agonizing weeks of this, I finally called you out on it. I told you that I knew you weren't happy. You agreed and so it ended. It was for the best. You said you still wanted to us to stay close friends, but you were just being *nice* to spare my feelings. That was true for about 3 days. In the last month, we have spoken a grand total of 2 times because you've been ""busy"". You were so nice to me, but you didn't realize that I didn't want niceness. I just wanted honesty. Being nice didn't make the harsh reality any easier, it just delayed the inevitable and made you feel better about yourself. 

Here I am, a month later. I'm ostensibly over it, but every time my phone lights up, a small part of my heart flutters on the off chance that it's from you. I often catch myself thinking about you, and I realized that I'm favoring internships that would be close to where you live, but by this point I'm probably just a footnote on your relationship history.

Being with you was the happiest I've been in years and I'm terrified to go back to the way things were before. Despite the protests of every rational piece of my mind, I pathetically cling to the hope that everything will work out if distance isn't an issue. 
 
I know your off hanging out with and probably hooking up with that same guy who you told me you'd never date. 

I know that the chances of a future relationship with you are virtually non-existent.

I know that what we had was not a good relationship, but I'm still holding on because it's all I have."
3vedn7,2,2015-12-04,Torn between my dreams and my duties,half_as_wise,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3vedn7/torn_between_my_dreams_and_my_duties/,"I am 23, I am a guy, I live in India. When I was done with high school I wanted to pursue higher education abroad. But my parents said no primarily because they were unsure of me being able to cut it so far away from home. In the end I relented and agreed to studying here. Then afterwards I wanted to choose humanities but my parents insisted I go for Medicine. So I got into one of India's best private medical college on my own merit and I tried to finish my studies.

But as the years went by my grades suffered and my attendance plummeted. I had little interest in pursuing the degree and, yes, I acted very irresponsibly. I got into the wrong crowd, started getting dependent on alcohol and gained a lot of weight. I smoked like a chimney and was almost into drugs and stuff but fortunately didn't. I messed up. And I know what I did was wrong. And I am deeply sorry for it. So I got rid of my habits.

However now I am too far behind to start making up with my batch mates in attendance and academics. I had to attend classes with students who joined later than me and I was labeled a casual student. I sunk deeper into depression and almost killed myself over all this. I couldn't talk to my parents because I couldn't bear seeing them disappointed by me.

But after that episode I gathered my wits together and I head back home. I confessed everything to my parents. Needless to say they were disappointed. And they have every right to be because I acted irresponsibly.

So now they want me to continue the course and finish the job. It would take at the minimum one year to do it. This is not counting a year of internship I will have to do anyways. So in short I will have to spend two more years in a place I didn't want to go and absolutely dread going back to.

I dread because, well, it broke me. I broke me down to the core of who I was. I used to be a happy cheerful person. But this place pushed me to the edge of killing myself and destroying the lives of everyone close to me. Even now I feel jittery at the mere thought of going back there.

The environment there I had immersed myself in was so toxic that the mere thought of getting out of there gave me a glimmer of hope and helped grab onto something to put my life back on track. Since I decided to leave the place I have lost several kilos, I have quit smoking, and have gone teetotal. Idk if it makes sense but the idea of quitting that place and moving on with my life gave me the strength I needed to deal with my self-destructive tendencies. No, I want to live; I don't want to die.

And I am almost certain that if I go back to that medical college and If I have to deal with that place again I will just break down again. I don't want to be an empty husk.

I want to live here for the time being, start a small business and in the middle of 2016 start going to college again with the money from my business. Its basically a dairy farm business. Its simple and easy and not complicated at all. We already have cows and people who look after cows. I just want to manage that and expand it for the time being while I recover and recuperate and heal my psyche. This will allow me a degree of financial independence and will allow me to move on with my life. My step-father always loves pointing out how much money I waste and I think this might help me not have to deal with him anymore, financially that is.

I don't even need my parents money for it. They have some money, a very meagre amount of their entire fortune stashed away in a savings account for me. I only wish to use part of it for expanding the dairy business. Either ways the amount I am asking for is a lot less than that will be spent in fees and expenses in keeping me in the college and finish the course.

I don't even want to practice medicine. I don't like it, its not my thing. I would rather research and discover new drugs and I would definitely love to teach students, something which I originally wanted to do. I love teaching and have the skill and aptitude for it.

But they are dead set on having me return to the college and finish my course. And get that 'Dr.' in front of my name For them it will be just a year or two that I spend there. For me it will just be so much worse. I will be constantly reminded of all my mistakes and it will be difficult for me to cope and move on and get on with fixing my life. It will just feel like too much to handle honestly.

I don't really get why my parents want to put me through such emotional trauma only because people in the wider society and the extended family will think less of me for dropping out of a course. A course I did not want in the first place. People may snigger now at our family but if end up successful they surely will thing twice before doing so openly. And honestly, people will at the very east rudely stare whether you are a saint or a sinner. That's just how it is. And now my step-father wont talk to me, wont even come visit me. My mother keeps feeling dejected and lost. Today she told me that I was a disappointment.

Really? A disappointment? I did not want to get into the course and you asked me and I did. I admit I made a mistake by getting messed up but I got rid of my addictions myself. There must be millions of parents who wouldn't wish that their children got themselves rid of their addictions. And yet they tell me that I am the same as a guy we know who ended up a wife-beater, cheat and a drunkard.

I am just hopelessly torn between giving into to my parents wishes once again and standing up for myself. Is it too much to ask to be allowed to make one decision in life in which I make from my own free will? Am I so incapable of rational thought and decision making?

If anyone of you can help me please do. I don't know if I want advice or just someone to talk to. I am just drained after weeks of going through this with my parents, and of weeks of being told by everyone under the sun what a disappointment I am. And I know my parents are tired and hurt too. I just don't wish to hurt them, but it seems the only way not to hurt them is by hurting myself enough to break me. Please help.


Thank you..."

I recently got a Discover IT student card with a $500 limit. It's been a month now since I got it. I made the mistake and applied to 4 cards. I got rejected for Chase Freedom, Capital One Journey, and Capital One Quicksilver. So there are 4 hard pulls on my credit history. At the moment Credit Karma says my score is 648. 

This summer I will be doing a internship in California and I'll be given around 9k in living and moving expenses. I would like to churn this as much as possible. I want to prepare to get more of the premium cards like the Citi premier vs Chase sapphire. With this I can get either 2x or 3x points for my AirBnB stay. 

Besides my thin credit, I have some things going for me: I have 50k in the bank (sitting in a Capital One 360 account taking advantage of their promotion) and I made 51k in internships last year. 

What can I do to quickly get these cards? "
3vepo0,1,2015-12-04,Im sick of feeling hurt by my own actions,water_bottle_goggles,ENFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/3vepo0/im_sick_of_feeling_hurt_by_my_own_actions/,"9 months ago, I had a breakdown in a relationship with one of my closest friends. I cannot blame anyone else but myself. I tried everything to make amends with what ive done and yet I couldnt do anything about it. I established the friendship out of wanting to be an inspiration in the person's life. However when I failed her, I felt like a failure to not only this person but to everyone else. Which made me feel as though I am not worthy of anything or anyone anymore. I live my live strongly by the morals that I learned, and yet I failed at the very thing that I live by. 

Right after it happened, a lot of my friends saw me drained of energy. The usual happy go lucky person suddenly turned tired, unattentive, and seemingly reserved. My flatmate got the full brunt of it, I would leave the flat at 8:00am in the morning and go home everyday at 10-11:30pm every night, not talking to him or doing any chores. I left very early and came home REALLY late because I was afraid of my own thoughts, I didnt want to be alone because my mind would speak of lack of forgiveness towards myself. Alot of people supported me... genuinely supported me, as I had done it to them in the past when they needed comforting; I had a lot of close friends. A few months went by and I didnt feel any better. My 'brother' (my closest friend) asked me how he could help. I can still remmember what I told him: ""Forgiving a person whose wronged you is easy, you can always hope what they've done could be out of their control."". I continued: ""What I did was fully in my control, how can I find forgiveness in myself? I built my friendships like how we built our friendship... we inspired each other so that we can better ourselves. But after failing, what am I worth?"".  

I studied engineering at a relatively 'good' university so my studies are a priority. However its always been my relationships with people that I hold in far higher regard. Perhaps the reason for this is because everytime I would go home to visit my family, I would tell my mother how ive helped 'troubled' people through teaching the value of having hope and forgiveness, which I did through friendship ive built in the year. However when I failed a friend, my relationships with people begun to suffer because I no longer saw myself as a 'fitting' friend. I tried to study harder but I found myself without energy to even distract myself after a while.

Funny thing is. When I tell my friends about what I did, they dont even blink and when I tell them why I feel what I feel, theyre baffled by what and why I put myself through over such a little thing. 

Long story short, I got a voluntary role at university. Where I was to 'mentor' 25-30 freshers for their first year (Im a sophomore). I got to know everyone very well because it was my nature :-) and put ALOT of effort in my job, far more than that was required of me.  In the process of knowing the people, one person I saw was troubled, very introverted but also very open about herself. (Uh oh, I know). The more I got to know her, the more I learned that she lived in a shell of misjudgements and misconceptions. (Uh oh). So I did what any of you will do, try to unravel the complexities of a person hence I invested a lot of time in her. You guys probably see where this is going... I fell for the girl so I waited till the 2 month programme was over and I confessed my feelings in private after our last club meeting which I treated the freshers to see a play. 

It was a misjudgement in my part. I knew that it was probably the worst time, (she just got out of a relationship). I was heartbroken ofcourse but what hit me the most is that I lost a friend, a good friend through my own misjudgement.. and purely my own. In addition to that, I was her mentor so I felt as though I totally undermined my position. All of which resulted in me having to repeat my second year (my grades were top 15% of the cohort, now its top 50% or even lower), lost internship opportunities, lost friendships (I became reckless with people's trust) and lost a year of my life. 

The worst thing is when im at university, Im surrounded by people but when I get home... its far from anything or anywhere populated. So im alone with my thoughts of what I did during the year. I only wrote this because I have 'attacks' where im reminded of my regrets. If it happens when im alone, my thoughts overwhelm me until I cry. Weird thing is that, I always think that apologizing to her is the only way for me to find forgiveness in myself. Ive had plenty of good opportunities to apologize in the past 9 months but everytime I mean to apologize, it baffles me that she still speaks to me like im her mentor and friend... like nothing happened.

Poncho has been chilling with his loose shed still on his body for over 24 hours. The thing is, it doesn't appear to be stuck. He easily got the head part off so that his head and neck, including his eyes, are completely free. His past sheds have always been pretty healthy except for the occasional bound toe which I've fixed with a damp q-tip.

The skin is very loose and when prodded with a damp q-tip pushed away easily. He has constant access to a moist hide which he's utilized for his previous sheds, and I've also misted him directly to help moisten the skin. He's still just walking around the tank in his skin like nothings wrong. No signs of distress or lethargy.

I'm not home all the time, but I have not witnessed him attempting to remove the shed at all. Has anyone experienced this issue? I can call my vet if I have to but I've spent $500 on his medical problems over the span of 2 months and I'm a college student trying to save money for grad school...so avoiding another trip would be really nice.

I can't get pictures right now because I had to leave for my internship but I can get some this afternoon if necessary.

Update; my dork finished shedding on his own by the time I got back home for the day."
3vfuhe,29,2015-12-04,I was one of the Skanks that jumped in Anthony's pool over this past summer. AMA.,cj_816,TACSdiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/TACSdiscussion/comments/3vfuhe/i_was_one_of_the_skanks_that_jumped_in_anthonys/,"EDITED: I'm a cunt and double posted this.

TL/DR- I drank beers in Ant's pool one night with 3/5 of the current TACS network, and met the famous Beavis.

Finally joined reddit last week, and decided to share my story of how I got access to The Compound on a random Weds night back in June. 

As you all know, LoS would occasionally do shows from Ant’s basement prior to the move to the Manhattan studio. Since they have an audience, their Twitter account would send out messages saying “if you want to be in the audience, email us”. It just so happened that one day on my way to work I saw their account ask the same question, but referring specifically to The Compound. I thought what the heck and sent an email to give it a shot, not knowing how many people they would take. I got a response back a few hours later saying to be at Creek and the Cave in Queens by 730pm that night, and that they would be leaving at 8pm sharp to head out to Long Island and Ant’s house. I drove to Queens after work and showed up at C&amp;C to check the place out. Very chill vibe, with pinball machines, a bar, and a small stand-up room downstairs. I met the LoS producer (Bobby) outside on the street, told him I emailed earlier, and asked who else would be coming with us. At that point it was just me and him. 4 other people eventually showed up, including a girl with green hair, and we piled into a van and headed off to LI. 

A few minutes away from Ant’s house, we stopped at a strip mall where Bobby was buying a birthday cake from Carvel for Jew Thug Intern Mike. The rest of us went into a Dunkin Donuts to grab something to eat, when all of a sudden the one and only Big A walks in to D&amp;D. He knew Bobby and recognized the girl, so he came over and said hi to us. I never met the guy before, but said BIG A!! which put a huge smile on his face. He said he’d be joining us at Ant’s house shortly in between his trademark stutters. We left and drove a little while longer and finally got to The Compound. 

We parked in front of the house and walked up the driveway past Ant’s Escalade. Now, I was expecting some kind of pat-down/ background check from KtC once we got there (he wasn’t present), but Bobby just led us through a gate to the backyard and down some stairs to the basement. We waited in a hallway for a minute before they brought us in. It was obviously one of the nicest houses I’ve ever stepped foot in. The basement is huge and contains a full bar, karaoke area, and signed movie posters adorn the walls. The table and cameras/ mics were set up for the LoS podcast later on. The Skanks weren’t there yet, but Rat and Garrett were setting shit up. Anthony was upstairs taking a nap according to Dani, as was the famous Beavis. We all milled about in the basement for 30 minutes or so waiting for showtime. Rat showed me Ant’s basement studio which was incredibly cramped with all the gifts and equipment he kept in there. Dave Smith and Luis J. Gomez showed up 5 minutes before the show was scheduled to start, as did Pat Dixon who was their guest for the show. At that time we found out that Anthony would be filling in for Big Jay. We took our seats and the show started. Anthony came down and joined a few minutes in, and Pat came on later. Needless to say sitting right behind the table was an absolute blast. 

Once the show ended I expected Anthony to hurry us out the door and for Bobby to drive us back to Queens. Dave, Luis, Pat, and Ant stayed at the table just bullshitting while Bobby and Rat/ Garrett cleared out the cameras and mics. Bobby then opened a bottle of wine and poured some Guinness for us from Ant’s bar. The other guests kind of stayed in the back, but I made my way over to the table and started talking with Ant, Pat, Dave, and Luis. The conversation was mostly around the growth of the network, and the phrase Anthony kept saying was “I finally can see where this is going. And I’m really excited”. Dave and Luis were both extremely pumped too. I can honestly say that all 4 of them were incredibly nice and down to earth guys. I was doing my best not to fanboy out, but they were open and friendly enough that I got into the conversation too, even getting a Jesse Ventura impression out of Ant, which is an experience to witness firsthand. 

After a few minutes Dani and the green haired girl came downstairs and asked if we were going in the pool. At this point, I’m thinking NOW we’re going to be leaving. But Bobby asked us all if we were cool staying. Me and two other guys said UMM YES without missing a beat, while the last guy that drove with us from Queens muttered something about Uber and left out the back door. We poured some more beers and went out in the back. Anthony brought out towels for everybody and swim trunks for Dave and Luis from the cabana. I asked Ant where Beavis was, and he said he was sleeping but would probably wake up and come to the door and meow to try to get someone to let him out. Sure enough, Beavis came over as we were speaking. I asked Ant if I could meet the little guy and he obliged, opening the door and handing me the Beav. He even took my phone and snapped a few pictures before heading into the pool.

Me, Pat, and the other two guys from the Skanks audience just stripped down to our boxers and jumped in. Big A asked Anthony if he needed anything, to which Ant replied, “bring about 3,000 more beers upstairs for everybody”. Ant’s pool is unreal. It’s a huge salt water pool heated to something like 90 degrees, and the jacuzzi is more like 105. The famous velociraptor is right behind the jacuzzi. We all grabbed beers, and I spent time hanging in the jacuzzi with Pat, Dave, Luis, and the other two guys from the audience. I actually ended up speaking with Pat for about 30 minutes and got his whole backstory, including the time he was almost murdered by an ex in a parking lot. He’s a really chill dude and I’m glad he’s signed on to the network. 

We moved into the pool and drank more beers. There were 2 other older guys there, in their 40s, who weren’t part of our group that left from Queens but were already at the Compound when we got there who just hung out on the patio. I think these were the guys (one of them specifically) that Anthony mentioned “didn’t know anybody or have any connection there, just showed up” and freaked him out a little bit the next day when he thought about it. I went over to Ant and asked him about his neighbors. He pointed out the ones who always call the cops on him (think he said it was some Asian guy), and then the other one where the kid’s father looks out sadly at the parties Ant throws in the backyard. The conversation then turned to cops, guns, and race relations. We got out of the pool and had ice cream cake for Jew Thug Intern Mike’s birthday, and hung out a little more. By that time it was 3am and Pat needed a ride back to Queens, so we got changed and headed out. I said bye to Ant on the way out, shook his hand and thanked him for letting a big fan he didn’t even know into his house. He just kinda laughed and said anytime, and we talked for a minute about the show and the upcoming studio, to which I pleaded MORE JIMMY. 

On the way back to Queens I thought of something that Big A said when we were outside- “Anthony is beyond generous”. It’s true, we all love this guy and the entertainment he puts out, but being able to hang out at his house for a night made me realize that he’s a very genuine guy who doesn’t put on an act just for the show. His personality and mannerisms are all the same once the camera turns off. I think it’s safe to say that I have been to Ant’s house more times than his former co-host of 20 years. Viva Cumia!

3vfw4r,2,2015-12-04,"I [25 M] have feelings for her[23 F], does she have them for me? Should I ask her out?",nomnomrelationship,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vfw4r/i_25_m_have_feelings_for_her23_f_does_she_have/,"The purpose of my post is twofold: 1) to express my feelings as I do not have anyone I can/want to be sharing with 2) would like some advice/direction on how to move things forward.

To give some background I would say I have identified with an introverted and foreveralone lifestyle from about highschool on. Currently have childhood friends just rarely see each other but maybe few times a year. Oh and never had a girlfriend add that to the list it will be important for this story.

Anyway fast forward to now: after having lived with my parents for two years (while being paid minimum wage to intern), I am now on my own in a new apartment with a new job. My field given the degree/career path is the public sector and all coworkers are all married and/or have kids (not really my demographic). So fast forward a little more I am at a conference and during a dinner reception with a client end up sitting next to a girl who also happens to do the same thing I do &lt;10 miles away. 

We actually discussed business at the dinner for a bit and so after about a week I followed up offering assistance on a grant we had discussed. I also thought ""shit I have no friends I have to take this opportunity to ask her out to do something"" so I added a PS saying we should grab drinks sometime. We made plans to get drinks after work at a local bar/restaurant (my angle hey we are two young people in an a field where everyone is older why not make something of it). I live outside of a major city and my neighborhood was having a kickoff barcrawl to initiate its annual beer week. I offer hey this is a minor change of plans but would you like to do this instead as the restaurant will always be there. She said yes and so we really kicked it off (no pun intended) and ended up drinking and talking for a good 4 hours. After we part ways she sends me a text thanking me for the night and suggesting something non-traditional. 

My parents always leave me with food when I see them and I had a couple frozen pork loins and decided to use one as an opportunity to cook for her. I ask her if she has a grill (knowing she lives in a house), is not a vegetarian, and if she would like to see me again. She said yes to all three so I propose to grill/smoke her a bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin (for some reason I am not allowed to grill indoors in my apartment). For use of her grill I would share with her my pork/bacon creation and she would cook a couple side dishes. As a side note I was kind of drunk from drinking beer the whole afternoon but somehow the pork was fall off the bone tender (even though there was no bone). Events after a little fuzzy but not much happened and I left shortly after.

At this point I have enjoyed our times together and want to do something again but am afraid I have been very forward in some of our previous plans and thought could I have possibly pressured her into saying yes. So with that in mind I decided if she really enjoyed our time lets see if she initiates anything. We text on off (maybe a conversation every other week) for almost a month and now Thanksgiving is coming up. Not sure if it was right but I invited her using the logic I know her family is 5 or so hours away and am not sure if she is visiting but if I were in her situation and did not have Thanksgiving plans I would like to be invited to do something. She politely declined saying her family is coming to her this year. She then follows it up saying we should grab dinner or drinks after the holiday. We make plans for this coming Wednesday at the place we originally were going to go to before things got changed to the barcrawl. 

Other events that happen: 1) we get talking about food and I suggest we should make something together again - she says she would love to 2) this past Sunday I ask if she wants to do anything. She says she is up so I we end up going to a local metropark where we walk/talk for an hour then to a local cider house and share a couple flights of cider.

So I will echo my original question: I have feelings for her, does she have them for me? Obviously only she can answer this question but please let me know your thoughts based on what was presented above. Am I at the decision: I don't want to string her along and have some other guy swoop in yet I also don't know if I can risk asking her out and her declining jeopardizing (my only) friendship. And if she did say yes? I have no idea what to expect, more of the same? How will I keep her interested? How often should I be texting her? Just little things like this that make me have to stop and think what is the next step in this situation. And yes I have had flings with girls in college and even at my previous place of employment but never having a true relationship has really eaten me. Not so much is it that I'm looking for the sex part as it is the just being together with someone I long for.

Thanks to all who read, even if not many do writing this has helped me express my feelings in a way. 

TL;DR Met a girl through work, have gone drinking with and cooked for her. Should I move things forward or keep things the same? "

I'm also kind of new to commenting on Reddit, I will be thankful if you could forgive and point out any mistakes I make (for future references). Hopefully you will see more of me in this subreddit ;)

Today I had a discussion with my mom about differences in opinion, using the opportunities you have and the like. She eventually commented on how I thought differently/can't comprehend her way of thinking because I was ""Westernized"". I was then explaining the difference between doing something 'because you don't have a choice' and 'making a choice when you can'. During the whole conversation I got really sad/mad, because I only started to discuss it with her to help her.. Considering I was getting emotional I decided to stop the discussion and left to go to my room. I was very sad and wanted to cry, maybe I'm PMS-ing I don't know(I usually don't cry easily). I felt like perhaps I should move out(I used to live on my own), even though I only will be home for 2 months(hopefully) until my internship in a different city, because I shouldn't be in this kind of 'environment'.. I was considering my options very seriously. 

Yesterday I had talked to my mom about a documentary I saw on Netflix, ""Fat, Sick &amp; Nearly Dead"". Basically about a guy who drinks only juice for a long period of time, and it's pretty motivating. So when I was in my room.. feeling sad she knocks and hands me this freshly-squeezed orange juice with big pieces of fruit and vegetables. (Apparently our aunt had borrowed our blender so she decided to just to cut in pieces, still they were pretty large.. I kinda chuckled when I saw it) The gesture made me realize, although we have a lot of discussions that I'm still lucky that she still does very nice stuff for me, and always has. Even though we don't see eye to eye on a lot of things, I'm very lucky to have a mom who still puts up with all the discussions and my 'haram'. And brings delicious peace offerings. 

-phew- I feel so much better after typing that out! I normally have a pretty ok-relationship with my mom, I do love her very much, and with these kind of incidents it makes me realize she loves me too. It makes the coping with all the shit less bad for me, I guess.. Albeit I will never compromise on my beliefs/opinions.

Thank you for allowing me to rant /r/exmuslim! I could go in more detail about the discussion if you want, anyways, Ciao~"

Or well, these are all my interns and a few of their friends. Let's see what each and every one of you made. 

***

We'll start with **The Leftover Royals**. Let's see what Devin and Samey made for us. *argues with myself* It's my turn to judge! Not now, Mal! Yes! Errr...let's judge!

Devin: 

Appetizer: cheese and crackers

Entree: steak with mashed pototoes and gravy 

Dessert: My famous Blueberry pie with a scoop or five scoops of ice cream

**Taste Testing**

The appetizer was too bland for me and it felt out of place compared to the other two meals. **2.5/5**

The entree was a lot better. It would have been nice if you added more detail. **3.5/5**

I am not a fan of blueberry pie but it was still good. I also enjoyed the ice cream but five scoops were a lot. **4/5**

Overall score for **The Leftover Royals** - **10/15** Put more effort into it next time.

***

Next up is **Brains and Brawns**

Miles: 

Appetizer: 

I'm totally risking my friendship with the Goddess of Karma, but I'm going to use cheese and eggs inside this dish. I'm sorry, Laurie. (OMG THAT RHYMED)

I'll be making a quiche lorraine (WITHOUT THE NASTY FUCKING BACON). Drizzled on top will be a hollondaise sauce and caramelized onions. It will be served with a beet salad on the side.

Entree:

I'll be making portobello mushrooms three ways, one of them stuffed with brown rice, pepper and walnuts then baked, and portobello mushroom fries, seasoned with turmeric so they look like potato fries, and drizzled with spicy sriracha sauce. I'll also make a cream of broccoli-mushroom, using vegan cream substitute and vegetable broth :)

Dessert: 

I'M SO SORRY LAURIE BUT I'M MAKING A CROQUEMBOUCHE. sobs

I just want to stay in this game

Anyways, whimpering I'll make stupid chocolate ganache cream puffs with a spiced choux pastry. I will feather up a honey-lemon glaze with cloves, then fucking stack them all up sobbing

r u happy nao

**Taste Testing**

*pats your back* There there, Miles. We all have to do things we don't want to. 

Appetizer was delicious! I enjoyed the cheese, vegetables, and especially the caramelized onions. I will give you 5/5. 

Entree...I love portobello mushrooms! Preparing them in 3 different ways was also creative. 5/5 again!

*stares at the dessert* These look delicious! Ending your three course meal with delicious ganache cream puffs was smart. They are nice and fluffy. *takes them all* Mine! *begins to eat them* Um...5/5!

I am a very pleased man right now. Overall score for **Brains and Brawns** is **15/15**

***

The next team will be **The Untouchables**

Zoey: 

Appetizer - loaded baked potatoes with cheese, bacon and buffalo chicken

Dinner- chicken parmesan calzone with a side of cheesy bacon fries

Dessert- monkey bread stuffed with chocolate chips

**Taste Testing**

The buffalo chicken was delicious and the baked potatoes nicely complimented the chicken. I will give the appetizer **5/5**

I love cheesy bacon fries! They are very delicious and the chicken parmesan calzone was also well made. I would have given this a 5/5 but since you gave me buffalo chicken before for the appetizer, it's a lot of chicken for me. **4.5/5**

I have never heard of monkey bread before. *stares at the bread and pokes it* It's not going to attack me, is it? There's chocolate chips in here? *eats some of the bread and then takes the whole plate* Mine! I love chocolate if you have not already noticed and even though monkey bread sounds strange, I will give you a **5/5**. Nice job, Zoey!

Overall score for **The Untouchables** a **14.5/15.**

***

*cautiously approaches the next team's cooking station* Amy and Rodney, known as team **Beauty and the Beast** Remind me again, who's the beast and who's the beauty? *you hear the crowd laugh in the background*

Let me see what you two evildoers made...*stares at the alien hiding behind some props* 

Amy:

Appetizer: I made me some delicious onion rings with a nice tomato dipping sauce. I also have ranch dip as another dipping sauce. I will sprinkle some salt on them from the tears I gathered from Heather, Ella, Lightning, and Scott. I evaporated their salty bitch tears and I got me some salt! YEAH! SCIENCE BITCH.

Dinner: A bitch burger is what I call it. I'd like to think I got this meat from severing the heads of those who have been 'eliminated' and grinded their heads inside a grinder and viola. 100% prime human meat. I also have some cheese. um, lettuce, tomato, Shawn told me the krabby patty formula so I use that too. bon appetit

Dessert: Chocolate covered strawberries with some whip cream. I got the chocolate from using molecular gastronomy. I converted the ashes I got from burning the bodies of the eliminated contestants and then I mixed their ashes with some milk and I got me chocolate. The strawberries are their eyeballs that I dipped in a cherry batter. yummy. eat it bitch. 

**Taste Testing**


*holding up a knife to protect myself and the crowd laughs* Don't laugh! This team is crazy! *calls over an intern* Please taste these foods, they may be poisoned. *the crowd boos* 

Appetizer: The onion rings are spot on and the ranch dressing was deliciously made. It was lightly seasoned with salt and it's at a perfect balance. **4/5**

Dinner: The hamburger was nothing special other than well made. [The beef was so raw that I could hear it moo](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/30/3002e3ee0e5c4844a5fead15310c0c44b40c8a4e2d9aab252bee8e739d5bfb56.jpg) **4/5** 

Dessert: I hate strawberries. [She was going for chocolate covered strawberries but this is all I see](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/3a/3ab9c8bdfd039da0d7f3d050896c96e335329d4ebd7f444b0d8f4f785d489954.jpg) **3.5/5**

*intern begins to choke** Medics! *the medics take away the intern* See! I knew you were trying to poison me! *the crowd boos again*

Overall score for **Beauty and the Beast** is **11.5/15**

***

Last but not least, **Just Josh**

*walks over to Josh's food station and sees nothing* ... *the crowd laughs*

**No submission** 0/15 points! 

Well, I would say Josh had the best meal tonight.

***

There you have it everyone! Let's see how each and every team placed. Now let's get the points from the last round and add them up to the points from this round. The top two teams will be safe tonight.

    **The Leftover Royals** 14.5  + 10 = 24.5 points

    **Brains and Brawns** 9  + 15 = 24 points

    **The Untouchables** 19 + 14.5 = 33.5 points

    **Beauty and the Beast** 15 + 11.5 = 26.5 points

    **Just Josh** 17 + 0 = 17 points


***

The top two teams of the night that are safe are **The Untouchables** and **Beauty and the Beast** Congrats you two! You survived this weeks double elimination. As for the other three teams, only two will survive this weeks final challenge! The team with the least amount of points will be gone.

***

The final challenge will be up soon! It will be luck and skill based. "
3vhpit,1,2015-12-04,"M4F -- House of Lies, The Office or Buffy fan? Come on in. Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3vhpit/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

3vhwn5,4,2015-12-04,Recommendations for dealing with fatigue?,arrowgirlie,lupus,https://www.reddit.com/r/lupus/comments/3vhwn5/recommendations_for_dealing_with_fatigue/,"I'll try to keep this relatively short... I've been experiencing cycles of severe fatigue since July, as well as swollen lymph nodes and joint pain. I'm currently in the process of bouncing between my PCP and rheumatologist for testing; they're leaning toward SLE or mixed connective tissue disease. This week we added 14 more blood tests to the previous 12 I had in September, hoping that something will come up. I'm okay with the testing, because I know it's the only way I'll get an answer. On the other hand, this fatigue is killing me. 

I'm a full-time graduate student with an internship and a part-time job. My rheum recommended Vitamin B, but I haven't really seen any difference. I've pared down my schedule, and try to schedule a couple days off per week for rest, but any other management tips would be so very welcome. "

We started dating, and we have 1000% chemistry. We work in the same industry, we like the same things, we love the same food - even down to the exact weird toppings on pizza. Our lifestyles seem to really be compatible too - neither of us are crazy about the glamor or nightlife; we prefer to just relaxed days, and do not mind getting take out and watching TV all day. During this time, I would buy her dinner, and because I work full-time (and she was working part time, as an internship just ended), I understood the differences in our financial situations, so I would gladly help out with paying for certain things. However, just a few weeks ago, due to various reasons, she decided to move back home with her parents - from the East Coast (where we met and where I live) to the midwest. 

We would always talk about flights to visit each other. However, recently, when I brought up the topic of flying to visit each other, and actually made it a serious consideration and plan, she told me how she didn't have enough money and needed to save some money so she could pay for her own college tuition. I told her that I would gladly pay for her flight (or my own), or that I could even use my built up rewards miles and use those, so no money would even be used. She said she didn't want to do that and she would feel bad if I did that for her. Now, I thought this was just girl-code-word for ""that would be awesome, but I'm going to refuse the offer to sound nice."" But this really wasn't the case.

Just a few days ago, I decided to order her a case of her favorite drink which she says she can never find in the US (I'm having it shipped internationally) to her home. I haven't told her exactly what I'm having shipped to her house, but when I asked to confirm her exact address, she told me not to buy her anything. Again, I thought this was her just being polite, and actually, she wouldn't mind me buying her anything. But, again, I was wrong. 

I felt really excited for her to receive it, so I mentioned in a conversation again that she should be receiving something in the mail about a week from now. That's when things got kind of bizarre for me. She told me she actually wasn't happy - and actually kind of upset that I went ahead and had something shipped to her anyway. She told me that it makes her feel like she's in-debt to me, and that she owes me something. I reassured her that this was absolutely not the case, and that I saw something she would like, and because I like her, I wanted to get it for her. She said that she is ""too independent"" and doesn't like feeling ""weak"" or like a ""victim"" that needs help. 

I was quite shocked. It definitely was not the reaction I thought would be happening from this. I'm realizing now (after the conversation about buying airplane tickets and now this random gift I'm getting her) that she seems to have an extremely hard time accepting gifts or anything from people. I kept trying to reassure her that I am absolutely not expecting her to repay me (I'm really not!!!) and I apologized if I made her feel that way. 

She said that it was fine, that she appreciated it, and that she's looking forward to the package.... but still said that these things still don't make her feel good.

Am I doing something wrong? What might be the issue here? 

TL;DR - anytime I [23/m] offer to help this girl [20/f], she becomes upset and feels ""indebted,"" ""weak,"" and like a ""victim"" to me

Edit: title should be ""..OR me buying her anything..."" obviously i'm desperate for help, i can't even type properly"

Well, ""senior"". I'm was doing two majors, but long story short, I transferred to a school closer to home after my freshman year due to money, and I just got worse and worse. I got into the prestigious business school at my university, and I'm double majoring, but for what. My grades suck, I have no friends since the people I met my sophomore year here already graduated, I'm doing shit in my classes, I just had a final where apparently we could bring in a cheat sheet and calculator, something I found out 5 minutes before the exam. So I got fucked there. All of my friends/classmates from high school and in my year are all graduating this year with full time offers from investment banks, huge tech firms, etc. and I'm just sitting here struggling to go through a data structures class MY SECOND TIME. That prestigious business school? Oh yeah, im still in it somehow, and have been getting shit grades. Everyone says its the B-school for a reason, everyone gets Bs. Well not this guy. Cs color my transcript. And this semester, guess whos probably gonna get an F? I have a shit resume, my GPA is below a 3, so no internship for me. I can't program for shit, so thats out the window. ""Don't worry, you'll have plenty of jobs, majoring in business and computer science is really good"". No it fucking isnt, not when you hate all of your business classes and dont connect with your comp sci classmates since you're trying to stay away from video games, even though you keep coming back to them. I fucking hate school. I just get fucked over and over again. I almost jumped in front of a bus today. I was diagnosed with ADHD, but now i think im just a lazy fuck who cant do anything right. Please tell me why I shouldnt just fucking end it, or run away and starve/lose my mind in some remote place, because I cant take this anymore. This past semester I went to class, ate in my room alone, studied alone, played video games alone. I'm getting a rhinoplasty in a week since I was always called a bird for having a big nose, but I'm debating whether I should even go through with it. I have anxiety, depression, ADHD, blah blah blah, all this shit, I've gone to therapy, seen psychiatrists who just want to prescribe me shit, and nothing helps. I'm almost 22, and I've never had sex, never kissed a girl, let alone dated a girl, since I'm a huge pussy, I'm stagnating in life while everyone else just keeps going. I look back at what I've done and I realize I haven't done shit with my life. I'm scared of being like my dad, scared of not doing anything with my life, and yet I don't do shit. I'm a sad pathetic excuse of a human. 

TL;DR 22 year old who's fucked, I hate my life, I hate myself, I want to just start over or die. I need a time machine.

3vijq6,3,2015-12-05,LDR arguments? Living together?,TimeMovesOn,LDR,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/3vijq6/ldr_arguments_living_together/,"My boyfriend (24/m) and I (27/f) have been together just over a year. We live 3.5hrs away and try to see each other every other weekend. We went to the same school until he graduated before our second month together. Then I went to Alaska for the summer (which really put a strain on our relationship and he stopped telling me that he loved me).

I am doing an internship this school year and have been hoping to find a job near where he lives but when I tried to talk to him about possibly moving in together (we would be a 1.7years then) he said ""I'm not ready.""

I have been trying and trying to get him to talk to me about it but all he keeps doing is ignoring me. He'll read my texts but not respond. I feel like I am owed an explanation!

When he gets mad he ignores me and just says ""Good night dear!"" And logs off when he doesn't want to deal with it anymore.

I tried to tell him that I felt like we should discuss this and that it was a big issue that you cannot just well, not explain.

He wouldn't answer me at all. I just do t understand, even in person when I try to have relationship talks with him he never participates in them.
I'll ask him if something is wrong with me/us and he'll say ""no"" or ""I don't know."" So I will ask ""are you sure there isn't anything you are upset about?""
He typically says ""I don't know"" again then says something mediocre that happened that day. (Example, like this weekend I was upset that he wouldn't respond when I was stranded outside his home for 3hrs, he was supposed to be back in town by 2pm. I. Called and texted and had no answer, I felt like he could have at least pulled over and let me know he was running late).

Back to the living together topic, when he was drunk the other day he mentioned that he ""already did that once,"" so I told him ""please do not compare me to your ex,"" and be said that he ""wasn't.""

Him and his ex lived together and that relationship really messed him up bad. He was in therapy for awhile.

tl;dr. My boyfriend won't tell me why he doesn't want us living together, and he won't have relationship talks."

You and your friends can then reference each other.

I graduated from college with a computer science degree but I am still unemployed so I am thinking for creating a ""failed start up"" so that I can write down work experience on my resume.

I don't live in USA so there isn't really much software development internships or entry level software development jobs where I live.

Most entry level software development jobs I have seen require at least 1 year of experience.

A start up is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

If me and a few friends created some simple programs with complex user interfaces to make the programs seem complex and created a website to ""sell"" the programs then I won't really be lying on my resume since the ""failed start up"" is a temporary organization with an online shopping business model."

I'm only 21 but I feel so old. I feel like everything has come so easy in my life. I'm 190 cm (6.3) 90 kg, athletic and go to a Russel group university. I've landed a HSBC commercial banking and wealth management summer internship last year. I have a beautiful Russian girlfriend of two years with Brandi Love's body. I've never had problems with making new friends or girlfriends. I've never really pursued a girl, I've only made moves after I've seen clear signs; and If I didn't then I would just move on to the next. I've been living on my own since I've reached the age of 17 and been entirely financially independent since the age of 19. I'm on my current year abroad and I live in a studio flat in the centre of ... (probably better not to say) for next to nothing because of the exchange rate (300 USD). I speak three languages fluently and lived in 6 countries throughout my life.

I realise that I come off as a narcissistic prick. This is not why I'm writing this post. I've actually been holding back from writing this down for a long time. I'm not looking for attention or gratification I just want to get out of this seemingly never ending hole of carelessness, procrastination and regret. 

I should be applying for internships this year but I can't seem to get out of bed and do anything. My friend got a graduate placement as a generalist in an investment bank and it would usually put more pressure on me to get the applications cracking but I just can't seem to fucking do anything. I've usually been motivated in the past by stress, but not this time. I wake up at 3pm and go to sleep at 7am. I can't sleep, I miss a lot of university classes. I should be doing work but I end up just playing video games that bring me back to my childhood (Diablo 2, Heroes 3, Dota, Custom wc3, PoP). I remember I used to be so happy back then... when I played. I had a good relationship with my family and didn't feel the pressure of getting them out of debt back in those days. I never had a good relationship with my mother, I haven't seen her in 10 years. I was brought up by my father and used to have a great relationship with him. I used to look up to him. Now we barely keep in touch and I'm not coming home for Christmas (don't even want to get into this story).

For past month I've stopped going to the gym and I feel so overpowered by daily activities. I have a genuine choice - I can either get out of this bed, put away the laptop and cook some delicious food or get out of the house, or go to uni, or meet friends, or do a billion other things. I don't. All I do is fucking masturbate and lay there and only get up if I'm really desperate for food. That is the only time I get up and then as soon as I get get less hungry I sit back on the laptop looking to be CONSTANTLY entertained or to take my mind off reality. I spend loads of time just lurking reddit, youtube, twitch and ... even 9gag. I can't stress enough how much I want to be entertained and to escape into my screen only to wake up 12 hours later full of guilt and regret.

I feel so mentally weak and I hate myself for it. I used to be so productive and successful for my age. I got into a great university and I worked my ass off to achieve the physique I have now. I'm only where I am now because of what I've done in the past and I feel like I've stopped and I'm just temporarily floating. I also feel like an actor. Nobody knows about how I feel, they all think I'm doing great and that nothing has changed. Sometimes I feel like I'm literally wearing a mask.

I'm fucking petrified of ending up working in retail full-time. I've worked in a restaurant on the weekends last year and I hated it with a passion. I guess my greatest fear is ending up like that, disappointing my whole family and my girlfriend and even her family. Another recent fear I've acquired is my girlfriend ending up with someone who is not as weak as me and will be able to support her in all the ways I can't whenever I'm feeling down. I've never had this fear before.

This is not the first time I'm feeling like this, it seems to go away and come back once triggered by something very stressful. 

Anyway, I already feel better from sharing all of this. Even though I haven't expended on three very stressful topics that (now that I think of it) seem to be triggering my carelessness. I might write about the Christmas situation, engagement and getting back to retail (if I don't land an internship) when I get down again.

I'm really hungry, I've been planning on cooking a basic meal (grilled chicken with cheese, mustard and a little ketchup in between two toasted bread slices) and then going to the coffee shop next to my flat in order to practice psychometric tests for the internships I've managed to apply to a while ago. I just hope when I come back I won't lay down again.

I'm writing this for myself with hopes of getting better. If you are reading this then please accept my apologies for not structuring it better. I'm typing whatever came across my mind. Also English is not my first language, hopefully you understood everything.

TL;DR : There is no TLDR version. Not even sorry."

From predictive modeling to text mining, I've learned all of the skills necessary to answer whatever questions that may arise. I'm very comfortable with navigating databases, working with different kinds of data (cross sectional, time series, network, etc.), and creating clear and concise reports and visualizations. Beyond just my classes, I've spent a great deal of time learning as much as possible and honing my skills; I'm extraordinarily passionate about my field and I can't help but want to constantly learn more about everything!

I'm aiming for a top tier company (such as A Thinking Ape or Amazon), and they pay their interns $5,000/month. That kind of salary will allow me to live on my own for the first time ever.

However, I learned from /r/vancouver that trying to find a place in Vancouver is very difficult, at least if you want a full lease. You won't find anything decent under $1000-1100/month, and you will have to compete up to 40-50 people for one unit. I don't know about shared accomodations.

I thought about getting a place in Burnaby, maybe it will be cheaper or less competitive. I would like to spend no more than $800-900/month in rent. In addition, these are my preferences:

* Close to a Skytrain station or Frequent Transit Network (FTN) route; I don't want to have to rely on an infrequent route like the 129 or 136

* Semi-quiet; I'm not expecting total serenity, but I also don't really want motorcycles ripping up and down the street close by or emergency vehicles screaming past at all hours of the day.

* I don't mind either a full lease (apartment, or townhouse, or a basement suite), or shared accomodation.

Which areas should I look at? Do places only show up at the start of the month (or will I find more places available immediately)? What kind of competition will I face when applying? Or will the expectations be lower than in Vancouver (e.g. only requirement is having a job/steady income)?"

Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3vlwat,4,2015-12-05,Parallels between the Brotherhood of Steel and 20th Century Fascism [Fallout 4](Spoilers),[deleted],gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3vlwat/parallels_between_the_brotherhood_of_steel_and/,"I was just thinking about the new Brotherhood, and wanted to point this out:
So, in case you haven't noticed yet, the Eastern BoS is going very heavily authoritarian, to the point that they are increasingly looking similar to 20th century fascism. Just going down the checklist of historical fascist governments:

*Use of Romantic historical imagery and related propaganda to provide 
legitimacy to the ruling government. (The Prydwyn, the use of latin phrases such as Ad Victoriam, neo-knightly imagery, titles, and organization)

*Idealistic stated goal, often based on history, used to unite the people. (Preservation of prewar technology to prevent a second apocalypse)

*The idea of a brotherhood among the majority or represented group (Humans)

*Suppression and demonization of minorities (Ghouls, reformed Synths)

*A common foreign enemy used to unite the people, often the target of extensive propaganda. (The Institute, Super-Mutants)

*Military and authoritarian style of governance under an absolute and often charismatic ruler (Maxxson)

*Idolization of militaristic values (They are the embodiment of this)

*Use of the military as a unifying cultural force (The Brotherhood accepts new recruits regardless of their current status or past history, as long as they are human)

*Focus on military technology in all areas of research (Liberty Prime, as well as pretty much every technological advancement they make, is military tech)

*Suppression of Liberalism (Minutemen), Communism (Liberty Prime is a giant anti-Communist robot), and Anarchism (The Railroad), and the promotion of far-right ideologies.

*Aggressive Imperialism (They're attempting to conquer the Commonwealth in order to extract military tech, ignoring the views of the natives and often viewing themselves as superior - similar to 19th and 20th century Imperialism)

*The idea of self-sufficiency (From their code of honor: He died for the sins of others. That will never happen again to us. We will become self-sufficient. We will become keepers of knowledge and lore. We will survive the end of civilization. We will take responsibility for our actions, and we will hold accountable the actions of others.)

*Protectionist trade policy (The Brotherhood rarely trades with locals, and even then is very careful about what it is willing to sell)

*Sometimes: Attempted development of WMDs or other major military projects (Liberty Prime)

This is very different from past Brotherhood chapters. While some derogatively called past chapters tech fascists, they never fit all of these points. As stated in Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 2, the Western Brotherhood doesn't care in the least about history, much less the use of it to provide legitimacy. Additionally, they were more isolationist, uninterested in establishing any sort of authoritarian government or cleansing the wasteland in any serious manner. The Lyons regime certainly had some of the elements of it - they provided a military for the Capital Wasteland, they united against the Enclave, and they (albeit less aggressively) suppressed ghoul rights by shooting (and missing) non-feral ghouls on sight. However, they were were substantially less authoritarian, more interested in providing safety to the settlements than developing a strong military base or pulling rule away from local settlements. In comparison to that last point, the Brotherhood actually takes over Diamond City in their ending. The Midwest Brotherhood under the General Barnacky was probably the closest to what we're seeing right now, but even they allowed the mutants to stay alive in internship camps - the new Eastern Brotherhood is looking for total eradication of ghouls, synths, and other mutants.

TLDR; The Brotherhood is a textbook example of 20th century fascism, and is looking far more like the Enclave than even the West Coast Brotherhood at this point.

In Bangkok for an internship for three months and the dota craving is getting out of control. Most net cafes I have seen around the places are just for casual internet surfing. What are some gaming net cafes in Bangkok, preferably around Ratchaprarop and Ratchathewi area that has DotA 2?

3vnfrn,11,2015-12-06,Mom found out,kuromadosama,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/3vnfrn/mom_found_out/,"This was back in July this year, 1 week after I turned 20 years old.
I came home from college after a exam and the first thing I notice was the wierd atmosphere, not knowing what    happened I go up to my room, as I always do, and I notice stuff have been moved around. After trying to talk to my mother and just getting ignored or answered in a really bad tone I asked my younger brother what's going on. 

He then tells me my mother cleaned my room and that she found some papers and she cried all day over them.
She didn't talk to me the whole month and would drop shade on me by talking loud with other people and in a rude, angry tone so I could hear. Then one day I backfired just a tiny bit and she just goes balistic on me, she called me disgusting and said that my life disgusted her. Latter that day my godmother came to visit and she said, loudly so I could hear, ""A son is always a son"" and I tought thigs were getting better, but no, another month passed with the same atitude from her, till the time came for me to leave for college again.

That day all hell broke loose, we had ""the talk"", as right before I left the car she just went like, ""Do I need to say anything?"" And I oppened the car door and said ""what you are doing to me, I have enemies to do it"" (sounds better in portuguese) and she called me back and said, ""I haven't talked before because I didn't know how to talk to you, I can't sleep at night, thinking of what you are doing"" ""what will the people say"" "" I can't walk in the street cause I'm ashamed and always wondering who knows"" ""You'll become a man, do you hear me?"" ""I have spent all these hears looking out for you, so you'd pay me like this?"" ""Have some respect for your parents"" and I asked what had I done to deserve such hatred and if it wouldn't be worse if I was a thief, a junkie or even a killer and she just said ""you don't need any of those to be evil, what you have done is the worst ting you could ever do"". Then the bus came and I left.

6 months have passed and things haven't gotten any better in fact I think she is trying to convice herself I decided to ""stop being gay"" but she never misses the chance to hurt me and make nasty comments. In these last 6 months she called my name once, the other times I was refered as ""the other"". This really hurts me and I feel stressed all the time, I hate being back home at the weekends and I just want to get out of their lives. I can't stand it, I can't stand the monster she became. I miss my mom, I miss being loved. I just fell confused and angry.
Obs.: the paper was a sort of a jornal, back from when I had a major depression and in wich I refered the word boyfriend which as the only thing she gave any atention to, but still using certain phrases to hurt me like "" be usefull for once"" because I said I was a disapointment to my parentes, friends and the world in the paper and that I should just disappear.

Now I have to find a new house for my next internship but I am so afraid of telling her anything about it cause I know she'll flip, what should I do guys?"

3vopn3,3,2015-12-06,My 3 roommates [19-20F] and I [19F] want to live without our 4th roommate [20F] but don't know how to break it to her.,Roommatethrowaway699,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vopn3/my_3_roommates_1920f_and_i_19f_want_to_live/,"I currently live in a 5 bedroom townhouse with 4 other roommates, we are all attending the same college and are going into our junior years. Before moving in the 5 of us all seemed to get along very well, and even now we still get along well with the exception of our 5th roommate, let's call her Sherry. The 4 of us, not including Sherry, are very laid back and have fun being around each other. Obviously, living with anyone they can get on your nerves, but overall my 3 roommates not including Sherry are fun to be around and I don't find myself upset at their behavior or trying to avoid them. We all like living with each other, so much so that the 4 of us have begun looking at places to live with each other next year.

Here is where Sherry comes in. Sherry is incredibly loud and obnoxious, her personality is very over the top and wherever she is she becomes the center of attention. Not because she has something particularly interesting to say or the rest of us want to pay attention to her, but when she enters a room you *have* to pay attention to her, she makes sure of it. Sherry is incredibly passive aggressive, we all take turns doing dishes and household chores but she takes it upon herself to do other peoples chores and will complain about it the whole time she's doing them. For instance, if there are dirty dishes in the sink and someone  is planning on getting to them shortly Sherry will take it upon herself to clean the dishes but while she does so she will obviously throw them around and clank them to draw attention to the fact she's doing the dishes, as well as make comments like ""Wow, these are so dirty I can't believe anyone would just leave these here"".

Sherry also doesn't have the greatest manners. On multiple occasions she has belched in front of all of us without the slightest clue that the people around her might be offended or grossed out by what she's doing. She has no awareness of her surroundings.

The final issue at hand here is my roommates and I believe that Sherry has a crush on one of my roommates, we will call her Jennifer. Sherry, Jennifer, and I all went to the same high school. Sherry and Jennifer met our senior year and quickly became best friends. Sherry and Jennifer lived alone with each other their first year, and according to Jennifer it was absolute hell. Sherry treats Jennifer like she is her girlfriend; always checking in to make sure where she is, scheduling her life around her, at one point when talking about an internship possibility over the summer Sherry commented ""It's a good opportunity but I've never spent that much time away from Jennifer"". It's clear that Sherry has an unhealthy obsession with Jennifer which Jennifer thought would get better moving in with more people this year but it has not.

In short; neither my roommates or I like Sherry. We do not want to live with her next year. The 4 of us are undoubtedly at our happiest when she is not around. Jennifer hides in her room when Sherry is around, one of my roommates does not bring her friends to our place because she does not want them to meet Sherry, the other roommate constantly complains about her passive aggressiveness, and while I am the least vocal about Sherry I share all of their grievances and don't want to live with her next year.

The problem comes in here. None of us want to live with her again, but the 4 of us are probably the only people Sherry considers friends. Sherry is focused on school more than anything else. She takes hard classes and even teaches a class once a week at the University. She does not really have time to go out and make new friends. If the 4 of us were to pick a new place to live and exclude her from it, it would crush her. If she were to realize 4 people she considers herself closest to, including her ""best friend"" who she treats like a girlfriend, do not want to be around her she would be devastated because not only would she be losing her friends she really wouldn't have anyone else to live with next year.

The 4 of us do not want to live with Sherry, she is a constant source of stress and we all wholeheartedly agree we do not want to do another year of living with her. How do we go about telling Sherry that she needs to find a new place to live for next year that doesn't include us? 


**tl;dr**: My 4 roommates and I do not want to live with out 5th roommate again next year. Our 5th roommate considers the 4 of us her closest friends, and one of my roommates is considered our 5th roommates best friend to the point of being treated like a girlfriend. How do we go about telling her that the 4 of us don't want to live with her again?"
3voy9w,1,2015-12-06,School and finals- Afraid I'm going to fail everything,ElmerBorisElevator,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3voy9w/school_and_finals_afraid_im_going_to_fail/,"So, I'm just kinda needing to reach out and get outside of my head. I'm a junior, and I've struggled with anxiety, depression, and ADHD. Finals week is always horrible for me, I'm always terrified I'm going to fail, and so far I haven't ever reached that point. But this semester has been not great, I have procrastinated really badly on stuff, and now I have a ton of catching up to do, papers to turn in, and finals. This week is finals week, I get to go home on Friday. I just feel exhausted, I'm afraid I'm not going to get through the week. Like, I keep feeling like Friday will never come, or, I just won't do anything and I won't turn anything in. I keep cycling between feeling numb and feeling anxious and guilty. I know I messed up this semester, and I just feel horrible and hate myself. I'm taking next semester off and will hopefully have an internship.

3vp5bt,2,2015-12-06,My [M/22] roommate [F/21] is very anti-social and has some tendencies that make her hard to live with...how can I make this work?,justwannahang,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vp5bt/my_m22_roommate_f21_is_very_antisocial_and_has/,"By nature, I'm a very social guy. I'm extroverted and I love spending time around other people. I heartily dislike being alone for too long.

My roommate is the opposite. We've been friends for a few years and decided to live together this school year. She told me before we moved in together that she can be introverted at times and treats her home like her safe haven - she doesn't like to mix her social life with her home life. That immediately struck me, because I saw our apartment as the ""go-to"" spot and I wanted to entertain a lot. She said she'd be fine with that, as long as it wasn't every week or people didn't stay over too late or leave the apartment a mess.

I just find it hard to live with her. Whenever she's home, she's locked in her room doing work or on her computer or reading. She hardly spends any time in the living area, in fact she has taken to asking me to spend LESS time in the living area since it's right outside her door and I do watch TV a lot/spend most of my time when I'm home in the living room. I think I should be allowed to be in the living room whenever I want, but the way she put it was, ""I don't mind if you're in the living room but I don't get why when I'm watching TV or I have my friends over, you don't just go in your room more often and give us privacy"". I will say that the TV is hers, and I probably use it 80% more than she does, but still, we decided to share it so I don't like being kicked out of that space.

Basically she gets annoyed when it's a weekend day and I'm out in the living room all day because she can hear my shows/hear me laughing/on the phone/etc because her door is right next to the living area. But it's a small apartment, and I never like to spend time in my room because I like to eat a lot and I don't want crumbs in my room. 

I invite people over and she always asks them to leave by midnight so she can go to sleep. I think midnight is way too early, especially on a weekend night, but she always says she needs rest and can't sleep if I have people over because we drink and yell a lot. But we're in college, and midnight is way too early to go to bed. 

She also cancels my plans to invite people over. I invited a few friends over to drink and cook breakfast food on Friday night, and when I came home and told her they were coming over, she told me that she had been planning on working on internship applications all night and, since I didn't ask her ahead of time if I could invite people over, I should consider taking the party to someone else's apartment. 

But I want to entertain! I like having people over, I like being a host, and I hate how she prevents that from happening. I get that we're not compatible as far as that stuff goes, but why does she get her way all the time and I don't get to entertain ever? She always goes, ""Well why can't you do it somewhere else, all of our friends have their own houses/apartments, we don't have to do it here"" or ""I hate cleaning up after people, whenever they come over they leave pizza boxes and red cups of alcohol everywhere"". 

She even called me out and told me that since I'm a med school student, I should be doing a little less partying and more work. She got all pissy and told me she never sees me doing work or applications or applying anywhere. I told her that's none of her business, but she basically told me ""it's time to grow up"" and stop acting like a freshman. I can't move out, because we signed a year long lease and if we break it we have to pay a lot, and neither of us can afford to live anywhere else.

How can I communicate with her and come to compromises here?

**tl;dr**: I'm a social butterfly, I live with an anti social girl who doesn't ever want people over and gets annoyed by the stupidest things, how do we make this work "

**Quick background on the shitty history with my family**    
_My mother was extremely religious.  
_Therapy has now taught me that I grew up in an emotionally abusive home.  
_I had no real friends growing up, because of their strict rules on visiting other people. I still have a hard time making friends now.  
_In my big city, I have my boyfriend, and 2 acquaintances. No real friends. However, I namedrop a lot of people in my classes to my parents so that they believe I have a huge pool of friends.  
_My father is in the military.  
_I live in a big city, while my parents live 800 miles away.  
_Despite his deployments, my father *never* missed Christmas.  

I currently go to one of the best universities in the world, and am trying very hard to set the groundwork to get into a good law school. I have 2 really good internships (one of which pays!), a nice job at a law library that pays well and is extremely flexible with my school schedule. I also babysit for a family regularly, and they have become extremely close to my heart. I have a really sweet boyfriend of almost a year. In short, I have a life in this city (and this is the city where I want to work and go to law school.) 

For the Christmas holidays, my school lets me off for 6 weeks. This is because we get 2 weeks vacation, and then there is a January term which most students elect to take off. However, all of my jobs allow me 3 weeks max for the holidays. I told this to my parents, and they told me that was unacceptable. If any of my jobs refused to let me off for the whole 6 weeks, then I should just quit and find new ones: ~*~FAMILY~*~ is the main priority.

The issue escalated. My father gave me an ultimatum--I either stay home for the entire 6 weeks, or he will not pay for my school next year (my senior year!). I asked him in what world it makes sense to punish his child for taking steps to become financially independent, by cutting her off entirely and leaving her alone in a big city. He told me he doesn't care what I want to argue--either I stay at home for 6 weeks or I'm paying myself.

My sister told me the ultimatum comes from my having a serious boyfriend. My parents think I'm living with him and having mad sex with him every night. They don't think this for any reason, meaning, they don't have any evidence to believe this. I do spend just about every night at his place, and I am sexually active, but like I said, they have no real reason to believe this. They are not in my city. I'm not being thick or ignorant when I say they have no real reason to believe this--since I was 15, they accused me of having mad sex and running off with boys, etc. And at the time, all I ever did was read books and play videogames. Didn't even *kiss* boys.  My parents were very strict, and despite my excellent reputation at school, were quick to assume the worst. It's almost a default accusation whenever they think I'm trying to distance myself (even a healthy distance!) from my family. 

Now, I *can* pay for my last year of college myself. I have a great scholarship, so tuition is easily affordable. But it means that I would have nowhere to stay. My city is CRAZY expensive, and housing is through the roof.  My parents' money helps me to afford a place to stay. If they cut me off, I'm homeless.

My boyfriend told me I could continue staying with him. We are compatible, but I'm afraid that by distancing myself from my family, I will naturally want to be closer to my boyfriend--and I do not want my relationship with him to feel like it's one out of necessity. I want to feel close to him because of who he is, not because I have nobody else. And I especially don't want to convince myself I'm in love with him next year just because if I stop loving him, I will be homeless. He wouldn't ever kick me out, but I don't want to force him to be around me if we ever do break up.  

Another problem to this is that: even though my parents believe I have a lot of friends I could stay with, they would immediately assume that I'm living with my boyfriend. They always jump to the worst. I would be ostracised by my extended family as well, because they would deem me 'living in sin.' Meaning that, if my parents cut me off and I stay and put myself through school in the city, I lose just about *all* of my family.
 
The ultimatum is recurring. :/ Happened this past summer as well. Seems like anytime I want to do something my parents don't agree with, they strongarm me with school funds. 

I think the issue is that my parents have always been controlling, and don't know how to let go. I also feel like they don't believe me when I say that my primary motivation for staying in the city is to keep finding good job opportunities that will help me with my law track. They think I'm just having a ton of demonic sex, and that I'm turning away from them for earthly pleasures. 

I guess I'm leaning toward just cutting my family off entirely, and taking a leap of faith with my boyfriend and try to make a new life for myself without the religious bullcrap. But he and his father are all I have in terms of support. That worries me a lot. 

My dad is calling me because he says we need to resolve this. But talking on the phone makes me a mess. I turned in some essays late because I couldn't focus or sleep well, and I'm having a hard time doing my schoolwork now. I have about 40 pages due in the coming week and I feel like I'm going crazy. I asked him to message me instead so I could have space , and he told me phone calls or nothing. :/

Sorry, I know this was a mess to read. :(

**tl;dr**: Family demands I come home for Christmas for 6 weeks. My jobs permit only 3 weeks of vacation. Family refuses to understand how important these jobs are to my hopes for law school. Dad delivered ultimatum: 6 weeks or I pay for school myself. Feel like the time has come to cut off my family. But I'm nervous because the only support I have is my boyfriend and boyfriend's father. 

Also don't want to be a spoiled brat if my family *is* being reasonable in this case. Really stressed from finals and looking for help/advice/insight. 

Thanks."
3vpamw,5,2015-12-06,Soon to be graduate looking for help navigating internships,Zoeamae,nonprofit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/3vpamw/soon_to_be_graduate_looking_for_help_navigating/,"I am majoring in Non-Profit Administration and minoring in Art History. I am also receiving a certificate in community development and arts management. I will be graduating this May. 

I am currently an unpaid intern at a local art museum in the Development Department. I also spent a semester as an unpaid intern at a local non-profit contemporary gallery. So realistically I have about a (patchy) year of experience in art related non-profits. 

I am currently looking at 3 internships for my next semester, all non-profit art related. In my initial contact with all of these organizations I noted that I was exploring both paid and unpaid internships. Which is completely true, but if one of these three internships is paid I will probably pick that one over the others. 

Even more, if one of these organizations can offer me a potential job at the end of the internship and once I graduate I would pick that one.

My question is, how do I go about asking this? At what point do I have that conversation?

I have interviews with the executive directors of two of the three organizations next week, would it be rude to ask either of these questions at that time?"

3vpdrw,1,2015-12-06,We've been friends for a long time... but also more than that.,throwwwwmeawayy,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3vpdrw/weve_been_friends_for_a_long_time_but_also_more/,"Hi everyone. I'm torn with this one and would like some advice on how to move forward with this. I've tried to forget about him and move on loads of time, but we both seem to be drawn to eachother constantly.

This guy, let's call him C, and I met 4 years ago and immediately hit it off. 

Became very good friends and would talk often. C went to a different uni than me, but everytime we met up, it would be great fun. He started flirting with one of my closest friend and I got jealous (I had never seen him in that light but suddenly I realised I probably had a crush on him) so... I went up to visit a friend at C's university, went out to a club with all our friends, and ended up going home together. I knew he was still seeing my friend on the side, so I kinda dropped it. We never talked about the subject but it was clear we were both affected by it, and our friendship suffered. 

C and this girl stopped dating, I was seeing someone else, and we started talking again (the guy I was seeing lived in a different continent so it was never gonna work). We would talk about serious topics, and even video skype a couple of times. A couple months later, he gets a serious girlfriend. I realise I'm still holding a candle to him, so I try to break all contact. Internship pops up in a new country, so I move, and we don't speak a lot during that year. I forget about him.

Last year, and when I'm back at uni, he has training in my town, and we meet up for dinner with all our mutual friends. We keep up with the banter we've always had. A couple of my friends ask me, once C's left, if there's something between us, since we have such great chemistry. Once again, I'm left wondering.

A month ago I found this crazy story on Reddit, and because I know we have the same sense of humour, I pass it over to him. No hidden intentions, I knew he would find it hilarious. A couple of days later, he sends me a message while he's drunk. In them, he tells me he's always felt like there was something between us, that we've somehow missed eachother, that he feels we have a future together, that he wants to come and see me...

It doesn't take a genius to realise he was drunk, but he confirms a couple of days later that his feelings were genuine. We continue flirting over text message. I can't help but feel that this is slightly selfish, as I'm always supposed to be around waiting for him, but then he always goes and gets a girlfriend. So, to be clear, I tell him how I feel. He says he feels the same way, but that he was still hurting from the breakup, and that it wouldn't work out because we live in different places.

I didn't tell him my feelings with the hopes that we'd start dating, but I felt like it was time after so long.

It's been too long and there's been too many things happen to just pretend like we don't have feelings for eachother. We've talked about having a future together. I want to respect the time he needs to get over his girlfriend, but I really want to see him. However, I don't want him to take me for granted. I'm not even looking for a serious relationship, but everytime we see eachother it's magical, and I'd like to see him more often.

What are my next steps? 

TL;DR: Long history with this guy. Confessed our feelings for eachother, he's getting over a breakup. What to do."

I have been saving since June for a new desktop with saving money from my internship. I recently sold my old Mac on Ebay and I now have money to make my desktop I have been wanting to become a reality. 

I will be using this for mostly gaming along with other stuff that won't really be too intensive. I have gotten these parts mainly from other builds that I have been looking at on PCPartPicker but I have changed some things up. I am wanting to get the new DDR4 ram because it isn't too much more to get than DDR3. 

I am however having issues on deciding which CPU and Motherboard I should get. I currently have the i5-6600 but I have also been looking at the 6600K but it is currently about $50 more, it is really worth it? After a long time of searching I have decided on the R9 390 over the GTX 970 which I think would be more than I need. 

I bought Windows 7 two years ago when I found it on sale for $20 (a legit copy, not torrented) and I also bought the power supply this past back friday (was on sale for $17 after a mail in rebate). 

The monitor, keyboard, mouse, and headset were things that I used for my old computer. And depending on how much I have I might buy a 144 Hz monitor (once one goes on sale, $220 is a lot more than I would like to spend).
 
I would like to hear any suggestions you might have for my build, other then the stuff I already have purchased. I also need the Optical Drive for school and I need the Wi-Fi adapter to get internet (can't get an Ethernet in my current situation). "

For the first part of the challenge you will be catering myself and the interns (mostly myself) and must carry our plates of food from the kitchen all the way to the dining room. You will recieve a score on this portion based on how many plates you can bring in one trip. You can choose to bring anywhere from 1 single plate to 8 plates! You only take one trip so to submit for this part you will say ""I will carry 2 plates"". Be careful because if you bring too many plates you will drop them and recieve 0 points.

____________________________________________

3vqhbw,6,2015-12-06,Programming Internships?,zZaphon,orangecounty,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/3vqhbw/programming_internships/,"Hi guys!

I'm an aspiring programmer (mostly know Ruby but I know some PHP &amp; some C#). I was curious if anyone knew any entry level opening or internships for someone interested in programming. I really want to start getting my feet wet and learning about it in detail.

Please message me if you know anything!"
3vqiaf,2,2015-12-06,Feeling horrifically hopeless and unable to cope...I don't know where to go from here,quickly_losing_hope,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/3vqiaf/feeling_horrifically_hopeless_and_unable_to_copei/,"I recently was diagnosed with bp1 and was diagnosed with OCD last October by my university's counseling services. I have constant ups and downs. Sometimes, I feel like I am literally on top of the world and am so happy and hyper that I can't even handle it. Other times, I feel so depressed that I worry that I'm going to hurt myself. It fluctuates wildly (I feel up and down several times a day) and it's exhausting, horrible, and makes me feel crazy. None of my emotions even feel genuine because they're so extreme.

I see the pdoc on a monthly basis and the psychologist on a weekly basis. I feel like the psychologist really doesn't understand me. She always cuts our sessions short (supposed to be 50 minutes, almost always ends at the 25 minute mark) and thinks that I just need to get out there and be social as opposed to that I have any real problems. This is the 3rd psychologist I've seen at this counseling center: the 1st was an intern who left after the first semester and the 2nd told me I was throwing myself a pity party because I was upset about something and so I switched to this one. Because I'm at college and my insurance is horrible, I can find neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist within 50 miles of either my school or my home. 

Over the past year, I have tried prozac, luvox, trazodone, hydroxyzine, zoloft, klonopin, and lamictal. Right now I'm prescribed 100mg Zoloft and .5mg klonopin and I was just on 100mg lamictal but was horribly disappointed: no results whatsoever. I was really upset by this because I'd seen so many people here talking about how lamictal was their savior. Currently, the pdoc is trying to get Abilify covered by my insurance so I can start that. 

I'm hoping for the best, but really feel discouraged. I just don't know what else to do anymore. I feel incredibly hopeless and at this point just feel like going to a hospital. I feel like I'll never get help or be better or normal. I just feel crazy and sad and like I don't even know or understand who I am. I don't know where to go from here or how to get more help."
3vqiyb,1,2015-12-06,"M4F -- House of Lies, The Office or Buffy fan? Come on in. Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3vqiyb/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3vqoo6,25,2015-12-06,How come you aren't a Christian anymore?,plumplum16,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/3vqoo6/how_come_you_arent_a_christian_anymore/,"It's a lot of things, but I'll keep it as short as possible.
A few years back I went to Passion (a huge Christian conference) with my college group and girlfriend. Well, while I was there I told her for the first time that I loved her. A few days later she broke up with me because ""God felt that for her"" or something like that.

Another was, when I was at camp my second summer I applied for a leadership position (that I really wanted and felt by God at the time ready for) and I didn't get that. So it bothered me. A lot. Especially since I was a returner. Suppose let the staff ""prays"" about their decision. 

With those two instances (happening within a year of each other) made me feel like I wasn't good enough for Him.

Then after I leave my camp internship at the end of that fall after summer (2013) I come home and go to church but start hearing about all the political bullshit that takes place there and I start to hate it and stop going. During that I'm in a phase where I'm feeling really depressed and lonely. And I'm wondering where God is at to take all this away. I went most of 2014-2015 trying to do better as a Christian and I briefly went back to my old church and was kept being asked to volunteer (I forgot to mention back in 2013 at that church before camp and after the breakup is where my depression came back and I became burnt out from helping so much in the church) that I stopped going to that church in August. I went to two more the following week but I got nothing out of it so I stopped going and in these past months I've realized how much I hate where Christianity is going and want no part in it and being angry at God because of all the shit that happened so I just gave up on it and moved on.

Also, during the summer at a group pool party I realized I was the only single person there and got drunk. My two best friends helped me (both Christian) well one of my best friends fiancée (at the time) was there too. Well, later on I found at her bridal shower or some bride party her and another friend (that I was friends with that went to my church at that time) talked shit about how I shouldn't do that because I'm a Christian or whatever and that really pissed me off to. Just a lot of things"
3vqq74,1,2015-12-06,Elimination #8,NoizDmmD,SuperTotalDrama,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuperTotalDrama/comments/3vqq74/elimination_8/,"Welcome to our all new award ceremony contestants! *standing on the stage* This time you will each be earning a **Gilded Mike Award.** *shows everyone the gold Mike trophy* Getting one of these will ensure you are safe from today's elimination! *stares at the Golden Wolves* I thought your team would have been able to win.

3vqrsk,9,2015-12-06,What would count as love bombing from Nparents?,91lightning,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3vqrsk/what_would_count_as_love_bombing_from_nparents/,"Hey guys! A lot of good things are happening for me right now. I am almost done with all of my classes for my degree and I already have an internship along with a documentary and a commercial fresh from post production. Many things are going great!

Except for one thing. My Nparents have been acting nice around me lately and it's making me uncomfortable. Because I think this is just some sort of ploy to suck me back into more contact with them and in turn more control over my life and sanity. Ndad found my documentary from an anonymous source (I will ask them where they found it on Christmas Eve) and told me how proud they are of me. 

This was odd because before the fall semester started and I told them about the one class I failed, they berated me about how I'm wasting their money and implied how I'm not going to mount up to anything in life because of the one class out of the several others I did well in. When I confronted Nmom on her personal attack and told her that I didn't like the way she talked to me, she told me, ""I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but it's the truth and someone had to tell you."" She then goes on to berate me over me avoiding the Nfamily. Gee Nmom! Maybe if you and Ndad would actually validate my side of the story, maybe I wouldn't be so prone to avoiding you! Ugh!

Now that I'm doing well with everything, they have been praising me and gave me a lot of attention during thanksgiving. I suspect love bombing. Do you guys think these people are love bombing me? What would be some other examples of love bombing and why are they doing it?"
3vqs1o,4,2015-12-06,Changing name on work badges/emails without first having a legal name change?,transatlanticturker,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/3vqs1o/changing_name_on_work_badgesemails_without_first/,"Hey, Reddit! Not really sure where else to look, so I thought maybe someone here could help me. I’m a junior in college, and want to start applying to internships so I can beef up my resume a bit for law school/graduate school, but I’m getting rather hesitant and concerned about a few things.

Currently, I’m not out at my college. I’ve kind of tried to come out, and I’ve even gotten my faculty advisor/professor of two classes/person I’m closest with on campus. At the start of the semester she had us fill out these cards and put the names we wanted her to call us as well as our major/year in class/and “anything else important” to us that she needed to know. At this point, I briefly considered giving her a disclosure so I wouldn’t be misgendered or called by the incorrect name, but decided against it. (My chosen name is extremely masculine and only used in males, so I guess a part of me assumed that after seeing that she would use correct pronouns. I now know that wasn’t the wisest decision.) She now calls me by my preferred name, and hasn’t called me my legal name once, but continues to use feminine pronouns when referring to me. Some of my professors use my legal name, and at this point I’m too uncomfortable with myself to change that because I don’t want to make things confusing. I’m typically quiet and don’t really interact with anyone at my school, but I go to a tiny, tiny, tiny liberal arts college where everyone on campus (or at least everyone in my two major areas of study would be aware, since it’s on the same floor of one of our buildings). 

When looking at these internships, I’ve been wondering what I should put on my resume, and on my applications. I understand that there’s often a spot for a preferred name, which I would utilize. I also thought on my resume I’d put the first initial of my first name, followed by my preferred name, and then my surname. Once I receive an offer/am accepted into the internship, I would then inform HR or whomever of the situation. 

I’m worried about my correspondence with other employees, and security issues that may arise. Although I may be able to get colleagues and others to use my preferred name and correct pronouns, when getting set up with a photographed badge in order to gain admittance into and out of the buildings, I’m 100% sure that they’ll put my legal name. In addition, organizational email addresses have legal names on them, and I’m really concerned about having an email address that completely differs from the name in the email signature. To me it just seems like a lot of problems that don’t need to occur, and as if it would provoke colleagues and others to ask questions that I don’t think is any of their business. 

I’d be willing to go through a legal name change and avoid all of this mess, but I’m only 20. I’m still on my parents’ auto insurance policy, and they have absolutely no idea of what’s going on right now and the transition. They’ve approached me, and my mother and various family members have gone so far as to ask if I’m using hormones to become more masculine, but I’ve denied it, knowing for a fact that I would be disowned since we’re an extremely devout Roman Catholic family (my father is a deacon in our church). For now, living halfway across the country for college is working out in my favor, and I figure I can just deny their questions until I’m ready to let them know what’s going on. If I could legally change my name without them finding out, I’d do it in a heartbeat. 

At this moment, I just don’t really know what to do, and it’s making me really anxious and really hesitant to apply for these internships and get these things that will give me the experience I need to be successful in my future. I’m also worried about not being able to change my name because of my parents finding out, and having to continuously be misgendered and called by the incorrect name because of identification badges and email addresses. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Has anyone had success with the changing of emails/badges/employee directories without first legally changing your name? Any help or comments would be appreciated. "

3vtg6d,0,2015-12-07,Is it possible to become a full time pastor without a college degree?,YesImaThrowaway12312,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/3vtg6d/is_it_possible_to_become_a_full_time_pastor/,"Hi. I feel strongly convicted by God to become a full time pastor, with a focus on youth. I was accepted into a four year university, but I'm simply unable to finance college tuition, so I dropped out during the first semester of my freshmen year, about 3/4s the way into the term. However, my vocation is still as strong as ever, and I feel as if God is readily equipping me for ministry. I've been involved at my previous church, doing activities with children, and I've recently been blessed with an internship with a local baptist church.

So I ask, is a degree *necessary* to become an ordained, full time youth pastor? I don't expect myself to be immediately placed into a church, but with experience (I signed a contract to work, unpaid, for the Baptist church for one year, I plan on renewing it January 2017, plus I have a couple years of children's ministry under my belt), do you think a church would take me in without a degree?

I believe God has called humanity to a greater understanding of Scripture, (this calling having *that* much of a greater impact on somebody who wants to dedicate themselves to full time ministry), yet I don't see myself being financially able to attend a four year university and acquire a theology/ministry/religion degree. 
However, I actively enjoy exploring scripture, understanding context, and deriving beliefs from it. I don't want to sound snobbish or anything, but I'd like to think I have a better understanding of scripture than the average Joe. I also have several ""teachers"" (who are either pastors, or former pastors) whom I enjoy learning underneath; we tend to spend a few hours simply talking about modern issues within the church, theology, what the average person needs to know about Jesus, etc. Another thing I enjoy doing is reading commentaries from accredited priests and pastors. I like to hear others' opinions on Scripture and the Christian faith, and I enjoy discerning them from my own beliefs. I wasn't born into a Christian home, but I've been around the block long enough have a solid foundation upon which I've built my faith, and I have wonderful people in my life who readily teach me what I need to know. 

On a personal level, my relationship with God is peculiar. Not in a bad way, mind you, but I find it unique. God has instilled within me a passion for young people, particularly broken young people, and I believe firmly that it's my calling to be intimate with the broken-hearted generation of tomorrow, to love them and show them the light that is Jesus Christ. I believe God wants me to faithfully deliver his message to this age group. When I'm intimate with God in prayer, this vocation is only strengthened.

As for my own standing, I am not perfect, but I am integral. I struggle with what any other man struggles with, pornography, and there are times when I fall. When I do fall, I feel convicted **STRONGLY** by the Spirit, and I'm always led back to a place of repentance. I'm aware that God has called me above sexual immorality (1 Thes 4:3-5), and through His victory on the cross, we are working to overcome that! I've also been praying that God provides a faithful wife for me, so that passion doesn't burn within.

Somewhat related, I plan on starting over my scholastic progression at a local community college this year (which is ridiculously more manageable, honestly, it's what I should've started with) with a focus on either religion (which if I do pursue, would make this question more or less moot), or some other ""tent-making"" skill. Perhaps if my financial situation changes (which I'm uncertain of), I would be able to transfer to a four year school and secure a degree

...

That's enough typing for now. What lies above is essentially what has been swimming around in my mind for the past week, so please bear with me if it seems like a wall of text with no real coherence. I know that if God wills it for me to become a full time minister, the way will be provided. I'm just a bit concerned about my future. (which makes my faith weak in a way. Go figure, eh?) 

tl;dr: feel called to be a youth pastor, no money for college, would a church still hire me with experience and ""secular"" education + discipleship from older pastors?"
3vtxco,2,2015-12-07,"I(21F) am concerned about a buddy (21M) moving in with his girlfriend of 2 months. I'm right to not say anything, right? Do you try to convince otherwise or just be there if/when he falls?",LemonyArtist,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vtxco/i21f_am_concerned_about_a_buddy_21m_moving_in/,"We've been friends for about three years. 

My buddy Roland(M21) met a cute gal, Lilith(F25) a few months ago. I was really his only friend here for a couple years before he got out of his shell with therapy and started making more friends other than myself. Yeah, he's got a best guy friend back in his home in Florida, but like I said, he and I were were really eachothers go-to buddy for a long ass time.

Don't get me wrong. I'm happy he found a gal that is also like him and likes him for who he is. He's asexaul and so is his new girlfriend. His girlfriend, though, I'm a little concerned about. We all have a friend or have had a friend, or even know a guy that has got into a relationship with a girl who has issues. This girl was in a loveless relationship for 5+ years and still lives with her ex (23M) in a four person roommate situation in a two bed, in the same building my buddy Roland lives. Lilith asked Roland out about a month and a half ago. 

The relationship Lilith had with her ex Mordecai was turbulent and seriously emotionally abusive. This girl has serious issues that isn't getting addressed with therapy, and much like a lot of new agey students, they're embraced in the culture of 'take mental health days off' and 'treat yo self'. This girl is a senior in industrial design and doesn't even have any real work portfolio stuff, no internships and no job prospects. She'll be graduating next may, and the plan that Lilth and Roland has is that Roland is gonna move out and Lilth and her buddy Maya will move in with Roland. Lilith and Maya will just get a retail job around where Roland works. We all go to an expensive as fuck private school, so I mean.. a min wage job isn't exactly gonna pay a lot in the tune of student loan repayment. Sweethearted Roland will support them until they can get a job. 

I know its wrong to use myself as a measuring chip, but for context's sake I have been through the ringer of horrible shit kids/adults shouldn't have to go through. I, however, addressed I had a problem and with three therapy at Uni, I have healed to the point that I am functional when shit goes wrong instead of devolving into a serious panic/anxiety attack. Because of this, I sort of seriously um.. ""look down"" isn't the word, but I wouldn't move in with someone who has their shit not-together, I guess? Lilith's sweet and all, I think. I just wouldn't depend on her to have a plan or anything right now. 

In the end of it all, I told my buddy Roland my concerns, finally. That I loved him and cared for him and am proud of him, but his plans seem really shakey and open room for him to seriously fuck up, and if that happens I wouldn't be able to help him like I usually can when shit for him goes down. He ended up saying ""I'm readin what you're saying"" but then asked me about a house I rented last year. 

Guy is pretty non confrontational. I'm worried that when he finally has a chance at being 'normal' since his transition, he might be going a little overboard with it. But at the same time, how can anyone grow and mature without making their own mistakes without having a safety net to fall on?

Going forward I think I should just try to support him if I can, and maybe get to know Lilith so maybe I could be a non-crazy or non-ex person she could go to as support. Maybe they both just need a little faith in them- we all know I'd like to be wrong and everything turns out peachy. Anything else I should think about/keep in mind/not say? I haven't breathed a word that moving in with a girl you've only known ~4 months with known serious ex issues might be a bad idea, because this is his first real shot at happiness. 

 
**tl;dr**: Asexual male fren meets another asexual female and they start going out. Now they're making plans to move in together in the next month or so, with the female not having any way to support herself. Said some things, not all things. What is my role as a friend, here?"
3vu3up,2,2015-12-07,"Me [20 M] with myself duration 3 months, don't know what to do with my life.",Whywelose,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3vu3up/me_20_m_with_myself_duration_3_months_dont_know/,"Hi guys!
So I visit this subreddit from time to time on my main account, people do know my name and since I am not a talker much and stay to myself a lot I don't want them to know about this.

So a little backstory, well, for the better off a 2 maybe 3 years I have been dealing with a bit off a depression and through that my self esteem has been shit lately. But it's not your typical depression, I do socialize with my friends, so to them this comes as a surprise because I do not tell my friends this as much as I maybe should, I don't know, I don't want ""symphathy"" or make them feel bad for me. I am not like that, AT ALL. And I go to school etc, just so you know.



Now, my dream and my passion has always been gaming, humor and informing people. Making people laugh, happy etc, I follow everything there is when it comes to gaming. I am THE guy. No I am not fat or got a neck beard and a fedora. 

Now, 5 maybe 6 years ago, I had a shot on doing something with my hobby. I turned it down for reasons. Way to young, I didn't have an education so this would be a risk so high, if it failed for what ever reason I would be so screwed for life. Now all these years later and this thought in my head, about doing something, trying something with my dream to make it a reality is still there. And I have immense passion and dedication to achieve at least SOMETHING with it, at least I think I do. 


Now on to my problem, last summer I finished an education which, in my eyes, wasn't something for me at all. I just took the course off 3 years because I didn't know what else to do. The last year was extremely hard for me because off my depression getting worse and the work that I had to do was pretty hard to keep my attention because off all the other stuff going on in my life. I did pass though! 


Now with this diploma, I could, if I wanted, finish an extra course within a year, this specific course is something my best friend has been doing as well and he/she wanted to start a company with me, this and the reason I didn't know what else to do with my life were the sole reasons I am taken this course. Now, my friend and our ""own company"" isn't happening anytime soon and I think the entire idea is off the table. So the only reason I am actually taking this course is for the money I still get from going to school and because I didn't know what else to do. Now I did some research on schools and I am going to visit some school beginning next year to see whats for me and what I want to do with my life moving forward, BUT this is getting restricted because off my intern hours I have to do, at least, I am 99% certain my boss would't want me to go to a school on Monday. 


Anyway, the course is basically running intern until June. Working all week, 1 day school and thats it. At school, the first few weeks, the work was fun. It were awesome jobs I had to do and not because I was at school, but because the work I had to do for others was sweet. Now having run my intern for the past month and a half and I absolutely hate it. I am not a guy for lifting heavy shit, going on high stands etc etc. 

Now for the past few weeks I am feeling my depression playing again, I feel like I am wasting my time here, I feel like my time is better spend looking for an education I DO want to do or even trying to achieve my dream and making money with what I LOVE to do, instead I am working my ass off on an education I do not like, do not want to do anything with it in the future, at all. 

I am looking for help, before you ask, I have been to a counselor, it didn't do much for me and I am looking for other help with my self esteem problems and my chronic depression. 


Now, my question is, what should I do ? What can I do ? 


Do I quit with what I am doing now, trying to get myself back on track in this year, mentally, look for an education I do want to do and try to achieve my dream ? Doing this means I lose my funding for school, for ever, I lose my monthly income and I would have to find a job to pay my bills, BUT I would have the time in the world, besides a part time job, to work on myself. ( I don't have many, I still live at home, but like phone, smokes etc ) 


Or do I finish this education and try to find the energy to find an education I want to do besides doing this. I get to keep my monthly pay, which is a lot more than I would get for working part time..and thats..the only positive thing I can think off really, besides getting an extra diploma. 



   
**tl;dr**: Chronic depressed, Running this extra course since October untill now, the first few weeks at school learning the basics and now working in a company for the rest off the year until June, I hate the work and I didn't expect it to be this different than it was at school. I kind off want to quit but the down and plus sides off the matter are all very important. 

EDIT : I have to make a discussion before February 1st. Else I have to pay 3,5 years in student loan debt or finish this course. Neither off which I am happy to do. "
3vucrq,0,2015-12-07,[M/24] Stuck in this situation with one of my best friends [F/23],coffeemachine5748,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3vucrq/m24_stuck_in_this_situation_with_one_of_my_best/,"So, I met this girl about five years ago in class, and we hit it off quite well right away. We became pretty good friends, always joking around and she would laugh the hardest at jokes I made during lectures. We went out for drinks from time to time and it was always great. A few months later, she broke up with her boyfriend because he cheated on her. A few classmates told me I should start dating her, but I was like “Hmm no, we are really just friends.”. 


At the first semester of the second year, I dropped out because I wanted to study something else, but we remained in touch. Fast forward a few months, when we met at a wine bar in town to catch up. She told me she would go abroad for a few months as an intern, and I thought that was great. However, I started to get feelings for her. 


In the beginning I thought nothing of it and just ignored them. Every time we met I would get a little more nervous so it was growing but I decided to just let it go. She would leave in a short period anyway. 
When she was abroad she texted me a lot. We talked through the whole day and this made my feelings for her grow even more. I knew every little thing she had done every day. 
When she got back I started to look for signals every time we saw each other. I couldn’t really tell, so I set up something which looked like a date to see how she responded (I know, really stupid idea, but I was really worried to ruin the friendship). As a surprise I took her out for dinner and to a comedy show. We had a great night, but it was obvious she didn’t see it as a date at all. 


A few days later I decided to tell her anyway, since this wasn’t really a base for a healthy friendship. At first she didn’t know what to say, because she never expected it. She proposed to meet that night at a café to talk about it. It ended up being a great talk and it was really great to get it off my chest. It seemed she never looked at me that way and rather wanted to stay just friends. I was ok with that. She was really cool about the whole thing, asking if I needed some time and she said she hoped I would still want to see her.


All this turned out to be great. I started seeing her as a friend again over the course of a few months and we became much closer than before. We both opened up more and shared more personal things and problems with each other. I was genuinely happy this was working out so great. 


Last Saturday we planned on seeing each other again. At first we met at a café at noon, talked the whole day about everything. We went out for dinner, got to the movies and ended up in another bar where she ordered a bottle of wine. 


When the wine was doing it’s thing the topic landed on the feelings I have had for her. And the ‘date’ thing I had set up, which she didn’t see as a date back then. “Well”, she jokingly said, “today could be seen as a date too, but should I think something of this?”. I told her “No”, and that I didn’t have the illusion of her changing her mind on this. She told me she didn’t either, but she felt like she only started to know me since the conversation we had a few months back and that she really liked how I turned out to be and how we became so close. I was starting to get a bit tipsy so I asked her what made her turn me down back then. She thought for a few seconds, and told me she didn’t really know but it probably was because we started out as friends and that never changed for her. When I walked her back to the train station we were both a bit drunk. I wrapped my arm around her. At the train station, she gave me a kiss on the cheeck and hugged me very long, telling me how great of a day she had. 
The next morning I woke up feeling really miserable. The day before clearly either refueled old feelings or started new ones. I felt like I’ve thrown myself back a year and all the ‘progress’ I made was lost. 


I don’t know what to do right now. I kinda want to go to her right now, telling her it was a mistake to not giving this a change. Five minutes later I realize what a stupid idea that would be. How it would ruin the great friendship we have built and how I actually don’t want to put her through something like this again. Any advice?


TL;DR: Fell in love with a girl after being friends for a few years, told her, turned down, got over her, became much better friends, fell in love again.

I recently graduated college, and I'm now looking for my first full time position, hopefully as an entry level data analyst or data scientist. I've worked with R, MATLAB, Java, and Excel in classes and internships, and I've decided to teach myself SQL while I continue to look for a position. 

This week I met with a family friend who's been successful in the field I'm looking to enter, and he gave me a number of helpful tips on my resume. One thing he mentioned was to add a ""relevant class work and projects"" section as a way of demonstrating what I've accomplished using R, MATLAB, etc. so far. As for SQL, he said that it would be good even to mention that I've been working on it independently, and to perhaps describe a small project I've built... So here's my question: do you all have any suggestions for a tool I could make using SQL that is attainable for a beginner, but also wouldn't be laughable on an entry level resume? Any tips are welcome. Thanks in advance!"

(Sorry if there are mistakes, English is not my mother tongue).

In 2014 I moved to the US for my studies. I am studying English, I had several work experiences in my country and I was able to have a great internship thanks to these latter. This is how I met him. We have been together since this period. I loved him immediately, it never happened to me before ( I have been in 2 long relationships before and they were for the most part : abusive).
He is treating me so well. He introduced my to his parents and his relatives and few months ago, he asked me to live with him. He is telling me everyday that he loves me, that we have such a good relationship, that I am his best friend and lover at the same time.
For me it was a big step in our relationship and I thought he was loving me as much as I do. 

Now, my visa is coming to an end very soon, so I will have to comeback to my country and probably find a job and start a new life. It has been months that I am searching for a solution and he knows it... I want to stay with him and I don't feel like he is ready for a long distance relationship... 
I asked him as we are in love and such a good match I don't feel myself like leaving him right now so I told him why we couldn't marry ? ( I am living in Europe...) and he started crying telling me that he is too young, that it is too soon, that he is immature, that introducing his relatives to me was just being polite...( they are living in an other state and they are barely coming to visit him ).
I feel what I believed was all faked...

I am lost... I don't understand why he is with me, why he is making up all these reasons...He said, I am going to save money to see you once or twice a year... 
Lately he his finding all the weirdest/random solutions to let me stay, but they are not valuable (ie : he didn't check on the internet at all), I feel he is taking me for a fool... I am desperate... 



I don't know what to think anymore... can you help me to see through this?
What should I do? 




   
tl;dr: In love with my SO, and have to leave the country for ever. Bf doesn't seem to care.. His life continues..."

3vvz26,9,2015-12-07,What the fuck happened.,muzik4life92,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3vvz26/what_the_fuck_happened/,"Warning: wall of text incoming

It feels like only yesterday I was moving into my college dorm, sober and happy, albeit anxious, about my new life. I took my first toke about a month afterwards, and thus took my first step down an incredibly slippery slope.

Now, 4 years and one college degree later, it feels like I've coasted through the past years. I barely remember so many things that I should. What was supposed to be the best time of my life is a blurry haze. 

It wasn't always like this - a gnawing pressure in the back of my head, craving just one more bowl, one more hit, urging me to pull $30 more out of savings to get another bag. 

It used to be the thing I'd do once a week or so with a friend in his dorm room while playing video games. My friends back home had told me they liked doing it, so I knew I probably would too. But I should have seen this addiction coming - as they say, addiction runs in the family. 

I'm literally writing this so I don't text my dealer. I'm unemployed, living in my parents' basement, wondering how it didn't go according to plan. I was supposed to get offered a job after my summer internship, find the love of my life in college, and be well on my way to maxing out my monthly additions to an IRA. 

Instead I'm here, wondering if I'll actually make it to tomorrow without smoking. I have my talents, and I know I'm capable of greatness. But I've held myself back, inadvertently at first, with the help of a little green friend. Now every step in the right direction is prefaced with leaving my green friend behind, but it's the hardest part of every step. 

I want to do so many things with my life - write the next great sitcom, or novel, or screenplay. Inspire someone to be better than I am. Perform a piano recital for friends and family. At the bottom line - be important in the life of someone else. But all of these things have proved impossible for me to accomplish when I'm high. 

I'm a lost boy, stuck in a man's body, wondering why the world expects so much of me. Everyone says it's supposed to get easier once you're on ""the other side."" I sincerely hope that's true, but I've never been farther from the other side than I am now. 

Life is a fuckin' bitch. Tomorrow is Day 1. Thanks for reading. "

It was a magical date and every day talking to her is better than the last. I feel a connection with her that I've never felt before in my entire life. It hasn't been much time, but we're both just overwhelmed by our meeting.

The, what I'm calling, half-promotion is moving forward and my training begins this week. Everyone at work is excited for me. And work in my current position has been generally good. Knock on wood, I've been performing the best I ever have these last few days, even heading into a 7 day work week. And having Nancy around keeps me motivated. She has finals and I have this crazy week going on, so seeing each other at the end of this craziness is keeping us both going.

And today, after getting home from work, I opened my email. I got the internship in Denver... I have it. The opportunity to runaway. To start a life of hard work on the frontier of independence... I was ready to look at apartments, to drive across the country, to leave everything behind...

But now I have this promotion... and Nancy. Things are finally going my way, and I don't know if I want to abandon it. On one hand, Denver will always be there. I'll have more time to save some money and find a more substantial position. I can see where this half-promotion takes me. I can really pursue things with Nancy, who's making me feel more loved than I have in years. On the other hand, what if I suck at these new duties and get stuck working til 3AM every night? What if things with Nancy don't work out? Will throwing away the internship have been for nothing? 

Trolls, I know what I want to do. I know what I should do. I just don't know if I can stomach myself pussying out of running away.

And also the Giants made me cry."

It's an in house call center for a large charity organization. It's so awful. All of the other departments have flexible schedules except us. 

The people who donate to us are usually kind hearted, but the stupidity is absolutely astonishing. People sometimes call to give a new card and ask if they need to give us the whole number. 

90% of callers are 70+ years old. Most do not understand the concept of our website. 

I'm a college a graduate but stuck making 13 an hour. My friends who work in restaurants make at least twice as much as I do. I do the same thing every day and my job is extremely monotonous. I don't do emails or anything anymore. Just phone calls and then mindless data entry. I feel like I've wasted two years of my life. Ive grown stupider as a result. Ive become cold an uncaring. Ive gone from a vivacious young man to feeling like I lost my balls. Our department is incredibly female dominated. All my managers and bosses aside from the CEO are women. I always considered myself a feminist and down for equality but I feel like working in this industry has made me more woman like. I'm less likely to be assertive. I just have to sit there and take it. Whether it's calls from donors or whatever new project or script other departments decide we need to push. I just sit back and take it like a lubed up ragdoll. 

I think that's why there's so many women in this profession. They're used to putting up with a lot of shit. I can't believe the creepy old fucks who call in just to speak to certain women. I can't believe the women put up with the conversations and don't try to be boring or cold to get them to hang up. I guess we need that money. Some dudes just call to chat. 

There's no proactive role for us. I hated the job the moment I started but I said I'd stay for a year to build my resume. One year turned into two...my spirit is crushed. Every time the phone rings my adrenaline spikes. I instantly disdain people calling in even though most of them mean well and want to do good in the world. I hate the anxious and nervousness of some people who call in. You can tell they lead busy lives. So many housewives and retired people who call us and have nothing else to worry about other than their sponsored child, many of whom imagine them to be adopted or their own flesh and blood. The old women who cry on the phone when someone leaves the program. I feel like I either end up taking on callers anxieties or I end up being a cold uncaring asshole. 

Im just venting here. Don't even really expect any replies. I just can't believe this is the life I've chosen for myself. I honestly fantasize about being homeless that's how much I hate my lifestyle. Fuck 8-5, fuck being the bottom rung of a company where you have no power and get shat on. I rebel by being incredibly lazy and am always on my phone on Reddit or whatever but no one complains. Tbh I've been hoping to get fired for well over a year because I hate this so much. 

No offense but I work with plenty of people who barely graduated high school. They're great, but I can't help but feel like an extreme failure. We have interns from a local high school who work with us. They basically do the same work I do aside from a few things. I feel so underutilized. I'm not a math person but it feels like I know how to do calculus but my job only allows me to add and subtract. 

I know I have it ""good"" compared to other call center jobs. I don't have as many calls as others do. I don't deal with as many angry calls as others. It still sucks though. My personal life is awful, it used to be okay but now I come home from work and isolate myself until the next day. Drugs and alcohol no longer allow me to cope. What girl would want to be with some guy in a call center who hates his life? I legit want to kill one of my coworkers who robbed me. I never could do that, but it really sucks. I know who did it but have no proof. I absolutely detest this individual but have to see her or him everyday. I used to consider myself a peaceful love everyone type and now I fantasize about murder daily. 

Call centers are the worst."

So what I was thinking, a sleek but not too demanding DE/WM that is easy to use, and just have a few desktop icons to the web based programs they will use (Presentation software, search engine etc.).

I had tried a few distros already. Mint Cinnamon ran reasonably well. I even tried Android-x86 for fun and while the interface is really nice and familiar, it was unstable and wasn't a great option.

* 1-2GB DDR2 to work with in each machine

* integrated graphics (mostly Intel GMA 3100)

So basically I use to work for this large american financial institute (its worldwide, everyone has heard of them) as an intern and I really did love my job. Its also important to point out I'm a gay and can be a bit camp but that's fine. Anyway I got on with everyone on the team (or so I thought) a part from this one guy - we'll call him CrapBag. CrapBag was a 40 year old something married guy with 3 kids and had the maturity span of a tea spoon - you know the type of guy Im talking about, thinks he's still young, think's he's hilarious but he isn't, loves the attention? Well me and CrapBag absolutely hated each other from the word go. and he made it quite obvious.

CrapBag would offer everyone a sweet except for me OR he would send everyone in the team a funny joke except for me. I didn't really care because I was 20 years old and this guy is older so if he want's to behave like that thats okay! Then things got a little difficult. CrapBag would sort of make these jokes that were about people being gay or making sly innuendos but they were almost toeing on the boarder of offensive, and after he would make them he would quickly look at me with this little smug look on his face for a split second, obviously knowing that he was offending me and being mean but I couldn't do anything about it.

Anyway on one particular day which my boss was working from home, one of my colleagues (we'll call him B-Bag) was telling us how he had been to see a particularly girly movie the night before with his guy friends. Well CrapBag and the guy who sits beside him were questioning why he did something like this? It is simply unacceptable to go to the movies to see a girly movie with your wife or GF, you cannot go to see this type of movie with your friends. So I was sort of like, okay I know what type of conversation this is and where it may be headed... and low and behold a part time employee beside me piped up that he had been spending too much time at the local gay bar. Yep, I definitely knew where this conversation was headed. They continued to discuss how wrong he was for doing this and how as a man you dont go to things like this. The worst part was, was that crap bag had a look on his face that he knew he was being an asshole but his toe hadn't slipped over the line so it was fine.

Revenge Part 

Not 5 minutes after this conversation had ended I received an instant message on our work chat from Crapbag which said ""The *Homophobic Slur* is being awfully quiet today"". Well my mouth hit the floor. I couldn't believe that A) this guy was bitching to someone else on the team about me because I assumed I was nice and quiet and got on with everyone B) that he would refer to me as this character C)How I was going to get him back. The conversation quickly went:
CrapBag: ""Oh sorry I sent you a very cryptic message""
Me:""No, I understand exactly what you're trying to say to me""
CrapBag: ""You don't understand anything""
So, naturally I went straight down to HR. Now my boss hated HR and said that if I ever had a problem speak to him first (which I did, I screenshoted it and sent it to him and explained what was going on and that he had to do something), but I had basically went into a meeting with CrapBag and my Boss on the phone and it had been an hour since the incident occured, I didn't feel comfortable so I went to HR. 

HR were furious needless to say, saying they were sick of the immaturity of my team (not including me, the guys were all dicks to be fair looking back at it) and they demanded to speak to my boss. I said he was at home, I had informed him and lets wait to see what he says before we take action. buuut HR didnt see it that way and got straight on the phone to boss. When I got back to my desk there was a shitty email from my boss basically being like - Oh, sorry that happened, I'll deal with it next week. I was like wtf? 

But then next thing my mobile phone starts ringing and its my boss so it's time to make crapbag crap himself for the first round. 
Boss: Hi PoshSpice
Me: HI *Bosses Name*
Boss: Can you go into the meeting room please?
ME: YOU WANT ME TO GO INTO THE MEETING ROOM? OKAY!
I go into the room and explain to my boss what's happened and he sends me home and that he doesnt want me in that environment and no one should be treated like this (he was a really good guy). Anyway I walk back to my desk and see CrapBag is as white as a ghost and he has completely frozen, well aware of what he has truly done. So I pack up and leave work, and now have basically been told that the fate of his job will depend on me (with the evidence and proof I had against him, plus the fact his chatlogs would be investigated and seeing as he had been bitching about me, it would all be looked at). 

Part of me wanted that guy fired, to make his life an absolute misery, for the pain and all the petty shit he had thrown at me through the year. Even when I came back in the following week CrapBag came out of the meeting room crying his eyes out after speaking to my boss, I knew fine rightly he was just trying to save his skin because he knows what he's done. However, I decided to be the bigger person, and when I was asked what I would like to happen to him, I asked for the lesser charge, and that it be dealt with quietly and nothing happen to him because he had a wife, and kids, and probably a mortgage and I was only an intern, Im only starting my life. But the good/uncomfortable news was that I had 40 year old crap bag crying in my face the next day apologizing for how sorry he was and how mature I was about the whole thing. The rest of the team got told off too because basically the message sent to me was meant for someone else. 

I guess the revenge in it all was making the 40 year old guy worry all weekend he was going to lose his job because he knew what he had been doing and saying was wrong and thought he could get away with it until he accidentally slipped up and sent a gay message to me. And I was 20.

TL;DR : Guy picked on me for months for being gay, slips up, I make him think he will lose his job, but decide not to.

UPDATE - Just wanted to say thank you all so much for the lovely comments, haven't read one bad one yet! I just want to add a few things - My boss sadly left the company about 6 months after this event and my internship was a year long so I only had 2 months to go. CrapBag and another guy were also given redundancy packages when my boss left - the company still exists its just it was taken over by another company and the bigger company had a bigger and better team so they took our information and files and were kind of like seeya later! As for the company, I say they reacted quite quickly in the situation because of how much damage could have been done to their name had I have really escalated this situation - equality laws are a very serious matter.

 I don't know what CrapBag or the rest of the guys in the team do now - and I don't really want to - after what happened I never fully trusted them again and there was a few instances where they tried to toe the line again and my boss quickly put them firmly back where they belonged. Those guys aren't professional's sadly and I guess its the nature of the country I come from for them to behave the way they do (it can be backward sometimes). The only one I keep in touch with every so often is my boss, he was a really decent guy.

I also have to say that when I had that weekend to make up my mind of what I was going to do, I did quite enjoy it, because finally I had a bit of power over CrapBag and he was well aware someone 20 years younger than him had his fate in his big gay hands!"

3vym7i,219,2015-12-08,I just got fired for something that I did while in my sleep.,mrtman327,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3vym7i/i_just_got_fired_for_something_that_i_did_while/,"I'm on an internship for a large company. One of the biggest employers in the country. Their internship program is so big they actually house their interns in (fairly nice) apartment complexes. Along with this internship there are some...oddly strict rules. In a previous post on here I mentioned how one night I sleepwalked and ended up peeing on my roommate. Well, my roommate ended up reporting me to security. Not to get me fired, but he just wanted things to get sorted out properly. He even stated in writing he didn't want me to receive a punishment, he just wanted to talk it out.

Well, I ended up getting fired anyway. Never mind that I was sleepwalking and had absolutely no control over my actions. Never mind that I sought counseling immediately after. Never mind that sleepwalking runs in my family especially after times of high stress. Never mind that none of us wanted to be fired over this. Never mind that in any other circumstance the victim would have some say in the punishment of the perpetrator. They fired me anyway. Company policy.

I feel like my life is over. I've worked my whole life towards working for this place ever since I was a child. It was my dream job, and I had it. And now I have nothing. All because of something I couldn't even control. I don't know what to do. I have 24 hours to vacate the premises. My life is over, and honestly I told my parents they might need to hospitalize me because I may do something stupid to myself. Literally. I'm never gonna get hired anywhere again. Who the fuck wants to hire someone who gets fired? Nobody. I fucked up my entire life and now I'm fucking worthless trash. It's not fucking fair. I'm a good person. This shit shouldn't be happening to me. Even worse my home back home got destroyed so right now my family is living in a hotel in chicago while repairs are being made so I literally don't have a home right now. Why the fuck is this happening to me. I honestly wish I was dead and I fully intend to be soon."

When I was out previously for the interview I met this girl on Tinder: we hit it off and I went over to her place to watch a movie; one thing leads to another and I spend the night.. Was fun!

Flash forward to ~3 weeks ago, I'm settled in the city and I touch base with her again. We meet up for drinks and it's a really nice time. Conversation flows well and she's very touchy-feely (taking my hand, kissing me, etc). I walk her home, make out a bit by her door, and depart. A week later we meet up for drinks again, near my place. Similarly good conversation, she comes back to my place and spends the night.

She leaves town for the Thanksgiving holidays, and I get in touch with her last Wednesday asking her if she'd like to get together on Thursday to watch a movie. She lets me know she has plans with her brother (lives in the city). We exchange some texts back and forth during which I casually suggest alternative days (i.e. "".... (maybe Friday or Saturday instead?)..."") but she doesn't address it. The weekend comes and goes and I don't hear anything from her.

Here's the deal: she's a foreigner and is in this city for an internship; she'll be leaving come January. The point is, I understand there's no basis for an actual relationship here - but I'm not trying to formulate one with her. What I'd like is to just see her a few more times before she leaves. The sex is nice, sure, but it's also just genuinely pleasant for me to share her company..

I know that if she were **really** interested in meeting up with me then it would have happened, regardless of the demands of her social life or otherwise work obligations (she's super busy - 6 days a week).. But while I recognize there's clearly more of a fire underneath me to meet up with her again than is the case for her, does that really matter here?

... What gives me pause is not so much a fear of rejection (I feel as if she's already semi-rejected me anyways) as much as a desire to *not* be that 'guy that can't take a hint'. Would it be pretty reasonable for me to ask her out again this week? Maybe only throw in the towel if that doesn't pan out?

   
**tl;dr**: Have been seeing a girl very casually. The couple dates we've had went quite well (with her showing clear signs that she's enjoyed herself) but I asked her out last week and got an 'I can't' with no attempt to reschedule. She's out of the country in about a month but... Considering I *want* to see her again, does it make sense to ask her out once more? Or should the towel already have been thrown in?"

3vz8yx,2,2015-12-08,Can I pick your brain about undergrad research internships?,Butter_Flyer,labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/3vz8yx/can_i_pick_your_brain_about_undergrad_research/,"Hi guys, 

I'm an international Life Sciences - Biochemistry and Molecular Biology student in the Netherlands (applied sciences bachelor, focused on research). About 1 year ago my family relocated to San Jose, California, but I stayed behind in order to finish my classes and will be heading to US by the end of January to stay. In order to graduate, I need to complete 2 different research internship placements (each 6 months long), where I need to be in charge of some side project for some current research the lab is doing.

Here in the Netherlands, my bachelor program has a very good reputation and the research labs actually line up to take us, because of our extensive practical skills. However, I need to get back to my family and my uni gave me the ""go ahead"", so I can get my internships done there. The problem I'm facing is the following: I've sent several applications to research labs in the area where we live, but have never heard back from any of them.

I have a good resume with my qualifications, also description of all the research projects I've worked on the past 3 years (lots of practical experience). I've made individual motivation letters to each one of the applications (yes, I actually took the time to read on their research and all), but I never heard back from anyone. 

I was wondering if there is a special way to apply for internships in the US and if yes, how I can improve my chances? I'm not American, but have an L-2 visa, which allows me to study and work without issues. I have accomplished a lot in my studies and I'm in this for the science. 

It is a bit frustrating not to be able to reach out to people, when I'm so eager to collaborate. I don't know if I'm breaking some basic ettiquete rule by the way I'm applying or if they simply have no interest in international undergrads. I like to think that they are just too busy making amazing discoveries and had no time to read my email.

I'm ready to start in February, but have nothing in sight. I'm slowly starting to freak out. Is there any tip you could give me?

3w047b,2,2015-12-08,I [20M] feel uncomfortable when my SO [21F] talks politics,altzfordaze,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3w047b/i_20m_feel_uncomfortable_when_my_so_21f_talks/,"For a little background my SO and I have known each other for a little over 10 years, and we started dating over the summer. We've been long distance since August for school, but we're both taking breaks from school, and living back at home (her for an internship and I got a very good job opportunity) come January.

So, onto the issue. When it comes to my politics,  I am very much a moderate, with views all across the board. Typically I won't talk about my views, unless it is on a specific subject I am vocal about. My SO, on the other hand is a hardcore libertarian, bumper stickers and all. She is very vocal both in person, and on social media about her views. 

She frequently goes on long rants about taxes, and gun control, and other topics, not really letting me get a word in, and when I do she treats me like I don't know what I'm talking about. And the few times I've tried to talk to her about it, she pulls back and is hurt.

It feels like I'm talking to a different person once politics come up in conversation, and I really don't like that person so much. I do love my SO, and could see things going long term, but this has been bothering me recently.

**TL;DR: My SO can get severe when talking politics, and it makes me feel uncomfortable.**

Thanks, I appreciate any of the help you guys can give."

As I get closer and closer to graduating college (2 semesters left) I feel like I'm slipping further and further down a rabbit hole I don't know how to get out of. I had an awesome internship this past summer and as interesting as it was, it made me realize that no matter how much I love my area of study, it's not what I want to do for my life and I feel like I've been wasting my time and feel ashamed about wasting my parents investment. This compounded with the fact that I have no idea what I'm doing after I graduate and I've started to get into a funk that feels like depression. 

I spend more and more time zoned out, I'm enjoying some of my favorite hobbies less and less and the nail in the coffin is that social interaction is more and more taxing, which hurts since I'm usually really outgoing and I hate being alone. 

Usually I'd turn to a friend to talk to but I've kind of taken on the role of the sounding board for my friend group since I'm one of the oldest members and have a lot of experience. Don't get me wrong, I love helping others, but it's frustrating since I really don't want to put my burdens on them since they have a lot on their own plates. 

I really wish I had somewhere to turn because I have a history of suicidal tendencies and I don't want to go back down that road. I know I should just reach out and they'll be happy to help and I know I should get some professional help. Maybe I'm just stubborn but it feels good to put this out there and get it off my chest. 

Thanks guys.  "

I'm a goddamn fighter, I came back from being paralyzed when the doctors told me I'd be lucky to get out in a wheelchair (I was 14 at the time). I discovered girls soon after, and going from football and lacrosse to a hospital bed didn't do much for my figure. I wanted to ask a girl out, but I wasn't confident enough, so I dropped from 210 to 155 post stroke.

Long story short I asked her to junior prom, she said yes, I found out it was a pity date by the end of the night.

So I fight harder. I do more extracurriculars, I join student governance, I graduate, I go to college, I leave a trail of rejection behind me. I do the same thing in colege, extracurriculars in all my spare time, different student and greek governance boards, rise quickly to the top, get rejected through the years. Finally I get a girlfriend off campus. Solid 8/10 and 4'8"". Heights not a problem, strokes not a problem, and I'm not balding yet. Constantly complains how her ex was jacked and I'm not. So I dumped her and hit the gym because I'm not going to spend everyday being reminded how she settled for me.

Now here I am a year later, close to finishing my degree, struggling through SS because half my body is fucked up because I came back from the stroke but never fully recovered and I wasted 6 months doing Bro-splits, sitting on top of the world leading organizations, on governance boards, working paid internships and having to turn down job offers from recruiters.

And  I feel like a piece of shit.

I'm balding so badly at 22 that I just shave my head, when I should take pride in my recovery I just try to hide it, and I know I've been eliminated from half the dating pool because of my size. I can achieve any and everything so long as that's not a woman.

Maybe it gets to me because it's the one thing I can't win at, maybe it's because I finally found something that is impossible for me to overcome. No matter how hard I fight, I can't be taller, I can't have more hair, and I can't be less crippled."

I am a 3rd year in-state student majoring in Management Information Systems. I will be graduating with ~40K debt. That is not my concern. I will be handling that once I am finished with school. 

I am trying to get credit-debt free. I was paying down my cards until my car died and I had to buy a new one. I bought a reasonable car (02 Saturn Vue 82K miles previously owned and well-taken care of by an elderly lady) for 2K in cash. I am also taking steps to reduce my bills. I split utilities with my roommate, so here is a breakdown of my expenses: 

- Internet - 30$ month
- Electricity/gas - between 30-40 a month 
- Rent - $500 a month (prepaid 6 months at a time with my financial aid) 
- Food - I don't have a budget, but roughly 100$ a month groceries and maybe 100 eating out with my girlfriend

I am trying to cook more at home, and I am trying to find a cheaper place to live next school year to save more money. 

I currently work at Best Buy part time, and have been interviewing for second part time job. I would like to make ~ 200/ a week (I currently make 11.50/hour at Best Buy and would try to negotiate to that at the second job) 

I also will be working full-time somewhere this summer as I have the past few years. I am currently looking at a number of technical internships, and as I made 15/hour last summer, I hope to make at least 17/hr this summer. 

Here is the challenge: 

-CC#1: Maxed out 750$, 24% APR, minimum payment 45$
- CC#2: Maxed out, $2450, 21% APR, Minimum Payment 57$

I want to get my cards payed off so that I could start saving for an engagement ring. I would like to propose in 2016 to my girlfriend of almost 4 years. 

So r/personalfinance, can you help me get my finances together? "
3w0hzl,3,2015-12-08,"Me [22 F] with my sister [25 F], she has bought me a more expensive gift, but I don't really have the means to return the favor.",Strugglebus_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3w0hzl/me_22_f_with_my_sister_25_f_she_has_bought_me_a/,"So I'm a recent college grad who has yet to land a full-time job, AKA, I'm pretty strapped for cash right now, especially because I might be moving soon to take an internship in a city with pretty expensive rent, so I'd like to save as much as I can before then. (Note: This post isn't for anyone to give me advice on how to save money or deal with my financial issues, I have enough money saved, just am in a place where I don't really want to spend a lot on unexpected things.)

My sister has had a full-time job for the past 3 years, and has saved up a good amount of cash, as she is a smart spender and a hard worker.  She is now in grad school (where, luckily, most of her expenses are paid for because she is extremely smart), and in the past two months has landed two part-time jobs.  She's basically killin it!  One of her jobs is a high-end clothing store that is adored by many, and she gets an awesome discount.  She recently bought a jacket from there, but said after trying it on again, she realized it didn't fit her well (they take the tags off after an employee makes a purchase), so she told me to try it on in the store and see if I liked it.  I tried it on and it fit really well (luckily her and I are the same size up top), and I told her i loved it!  She said that she would keep that in mind, and I think there was a winky face in there somewhere.  Basically, I think she's giving it to me for Christmas.  

The only thing is, even with her discount, the jacket is about $100.  My sister and I always exchange gifts for Christmas, but normally we decide the price range after one of us purchases a gift for the other.  For instance, if I find a $40 ticket to a show that I know she will love, I will say ""I spent $40 on you, so let's do $40 each this Christmas"".  We like to keep things even and it normally works out really well.

I guess my question here is, what do you guys think I could do that would be equivalent to spending $100 without actually...spending $100?  I want to maybe make her something that she will get good use out of, or get her something special, so it doesn't seem like I'm letting her spoil me and half-assing it on her.  If I had to spend $100, I would, but I'd like to avoid shelling out so much cash! And she also hasn't given me a lot of ideas on what to get her, so I think that finding $100 worth of things to get her would just end with me buying a $50 Anthropologie giftcard on top of some other gift, and then calling it a day.

I should also add that for my graduation, she gave me a very nice and unexpected gift; a hefty giftcard to a nicer clothing store so I could buy interview clothing, a nice notebook with my initials inscribed on the front, and a beautiful scarf.  I could tell she didn't expect anything in return for her sweet gifts, and that she was happy to give them.  I guess this just adds on that I don't think she would be mad if I were to not spend $100 on her, as long as I gave a heartfelt gift.

So finally, these are my questions to you:
1. What are some gifts that I could make for my sister/have you guys done anything that I could put a creative spin on that my sister would love?
and 
2. If you're an older sibling who has a good relationship with their younger sibling, how would you feel toward the situation?  

I dont think my sister will feel upset either way, as she is not just doing this for me so that she will get an expensive gift in return. Just looking for some ideas and advice.  Thanks!

Oh and also, I haven't really asked her about our spending limit yes, as we are talking on the phone tonight, but even if she says ""you don't have to spend $100 on me!"" I would like to give her a nice present. :)

TL;DR- My sister is more well-off than I am, mostly due to her being older, and is likely giving me an expensive Christmas gift.  Looking for ideas of things to get her/make for her that are special and creative to match an expensive gift."

I have all the prerequisite Excel skill, an exam, and some computer programming skill, but would love any advice or further insight into what would help my resume. 

The recruiter mentioned building my ""business acumen,"" which seems like a pretty vague term to me.

I'm also planning to shadow an actuary who's a family friend which the same recruiter also suggested. Any advice on how exactly to go about that? Would that probably be like a 1 day thing, or a couple days to properly immerse myself enough.

Any advice or suggestions would be helpful. I feel like I'm exhausting my options at this point and I'm already studying 3 hours a day for my next exam which is 3 months away."
3w15x3,4,2015-12-08,Chatrealmer's Ridiculously Unofficial Movie Draft Update Memo (CRUMDUM) - Week 10 - Mid-Season Report,MovieLeagueMike,DiamondClub,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiamondClub/comments/3w15x3/chatrealmers_ridiculously_unofficial_movie_draft/,"**CRUMDUM Week 10 - Mid-Season Report**

&amp;nbsp;

Gotcha!

We bet you all fell for that prank ""Pre-Season Predictions"" CRUMDUM. Classic CRUMDUM staff hijinks, pretending we didn't know who was actually going to win! We wish we could see your faces now! Whoo-boy!

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, fun's fun, but let's see how it's really going to play out.

&amp;nbsp;

The midpoint of the Movie Draft season is the time when we here at the CRUMDUM traditionally send an intern over to the faded army-green, dented, four-drawer metal filing cabinet to retrieve the ""W"" folder from the bottom drawer, which contains everything we file under ""What Were We Thinking?"", like the set of iron-on t-shirt transfers reading *Super Bowl Champion Cleveland Browns*, the other t-shirt transfers reading *Cleveland Browns: 8-8 Isn't So Bad*, and the Movie Draft Pre-Season Predictions.

Then the intern comes back empty-handed, and we all remember that in a move to efficiency, we started printing the pre-season predictions and walking them directly to the shredder. This year though, some high-energy, real go-getter intern actually backed up the pre-season data from the office computer. Not sure where he picked up that skill, as none of us on staff has bothered to learn how it's done. The last thing we cared about enough to back up was our game progress in *Zork*, and a lot of good that did us, because by the time we had finally gotten to the second Mirror Room, they stopped putting floppy drives on PCs.

Anyhow...

The film industry is going through what insiders call a BOL stretch (for ""Browns Offensive Line"" because so few movies are creating decent openings). Everyone in the Movie Draft (save one abstainer) has been affected by, if not an outright bomb, a disappointing entry on their slate. In that respect, it appears that Brian's *War Games* strategy to this point is the right one: the only way to win is not to play. In the long run, though, while that may be fine in Global Thermonuclear War, the Movie Draft requires that you eventually do play, and Brian enters the fray very soon.

But this overall dearth of big movies makes our mid-season job quite a bit easier. We're actually somewhat *confident (!)* about the general order of finish, although the only question that really matters is still in doubt.

&amp;nbsp;

**Justin - Now: 5th Place ($110M) - Pre-Season Prediction: 6th Place ($425M) - Updated Prediction: 6th Place ($317M) Slate Killer^1: Steve Jobs**
If the Movie Draft was played in halves, Justin would be in decent shape for the second-half crown with *Creed* and *Krampus* (okay, and if Brian got only 37.5% of *Star Wars*). But *Krampus*, with its $16M opening weekend, looks to not only be the buy of the season, but very possibly the best purchase in the history of the game. At a cost of $2 and a likely take of $50M, it would reach a stratospheric *25x multiplier!* When Team Amtrekker (remember them?) won the 2014 Summer Movie Draft thanks in large part to *The Fault in Our Stars* and its 21x multiplier, that looked like an untouchable mark. *Krampus* is not only a great movie title, but also the best two dollars ever spent in the game.

It is not a split season, however, and the albatrosses (albatreese? -tri?) of *Steve Jobs* and *The 33* look to leave Justin anchored to the bottom of the standings.

&amp;nbsp;

**Kristi - Now: 3rd ($232M) - Pre-Season: 4th ($555M) - Updated: 5th ($348M) - Killer: Hunger Games**
How long have we been gone? Step away for two-and-a-half weeks and it looks like we missed two-and-a-half months. Last time we checked in, Kristi had both earned and spent zero dollars. Now she's got over $200M in the bank, and spent all but $15, and by next week she'll have spent it all. If nothing else, that *is* the true spirit of the holidays, to spend all your money in a three week stretch around Thanksgiving.

While it's tough to call something that earns $200M in a couple weeks the killer of your chances, *Mockingjay - Part 2* is 12% behind Part 1, the previous low-earner of the series, and looks like it will top out around $275M, or $100M below our prediction. *Harry Potterstein* didn't do her any favors, either. But, if nothing else, she can keep *Jurassic World* and *Minions* on constant rotation and reminisce about her sweet summer success.

&amp;nbsp;

**Brian I - Now: 4th ($138M) - Pre-Season: 5th ($550) - Updated: 4th ($406M) - Killer: Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocolypse**
Damn, we wanted *Scout's Guide* to be good. Its 44% Rotten Tomatoes grade is probably just high enough that we'll make time for it on Netflix, but it got bit (ha!) by Paramount's early Video On Demand plan which cost it half its theaters.

If there were bonuses for Oscar nominations, Brian would probably be in the thick of things, with a possible four nominees on his slate--*Bridge of Spies* and his Christmas Day trio of *Joy, The Hateful Eight, and The Revenant*. We think those holiday hopefuls will just about triple his current score, pushing him past $400M and keeping him in fourth place.

&amp;nbsp;

**Mulango - Now: 2nd ($315M) - Pre-Season: 1st ($720M) - Updated: 3rd ($480M) - Killer: Paranormal Activia 6: Yogurt of Doom**
Mulango started out well with *The Martian*, on pace for $230M, right on the verge of an 8x multiplier, excellent in the winter draft. But then came *Paranormal Activity 6: The Ghost Detention*^2, which brought him back to earth, as it were. *PA6* saved its biggest scares for when Mulango checked weekly box office results.

And then the unthinkable happened. *The Good Dinosaur*, a *Pixar* movie, opened to only $55M over a holiday weekend, then dropped a Pixar record 61% in its second week. Nobody saw that coming. At a cost to Mulango of only $20, it definitely won't be a flop, but hopes were so much higher. If *The Big Short* or *The Fifth Wave* over-perform, Mulango could still crack $500M. We see him finishing in the top three, but can no longer predict a championship repeat.

&amp;nbsp;

We've been wrong before. Pretty often, it turns out. But we feel pretty good about those four projections. The last two get dicey.

&amp;nbsp;

In last place, over $100M behind the nearest competitor, Brian B has had the least stressful season to this point. No movies released, nothing to care about. No worries over the early Thursday shows, opening day Friday results, what they indicate for the weekend, how my other movies are holding--none of that. No real reason to look at box office numbers at all, or even read the CRUMDUM (apart from its refined entertainment value, of course).

But now things change. We *have* been looking across the web at numerous projections for all the remaining movies, and we're now convinced that Brian's hopes for a WMD championship could very well be significantly influenced by how well his next movie does.

So *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is going to be big. Probably historically big. It will at least *double* the best December opening ever ($85M - *The Hobbit*) and could very well have the best opening ever ($209M - *Jurassic World*). Some are calling for $300M. And it looks like weather will be cooperating (60 degrees here in winter vacation destination Cleveland, Ohio). And all real competition has cleared out a month in either direction.

But... we can't help thinking holiday commitments will stunt rabid repeat viewing from the generation that grew up with Han, Luke, and Leia. We say it barely misses a $200M opening weekend, it *does* break *Avatar*'s all-time record of $761M, but not soon enough. If this were the Summer Movie Draft, we think the numbers would come faster and we'd go with Brian. But...

&amp;nbsp;

**Brian B - Now: 6th ($0) - Pre-Season: 3rd ($580) - Updated: 2nd ($580) - Killer: None**

&amp;nbsp;

**Tom - Now: 1st ($445M) - Pre-Season: 2nd ($705M) - Updated: 1st ($623M) - Killer: None (unless we're wrong and Brian wins, then it's that piece of unholy crap Jem and the Holograms)**
Tom currently has the two best value movies in *Goosebumps* (16x) and *The Peanuts Movie* (11x) (though they'll be 2nd and 3rd in a couple days, no match for the phenom that is *Krampus*). Throw in *The Last Witch Hunter* and *Spectre* and he's got four of the top seven. We guess there's another $45M to be had from his already released movies, and enough love for *Saturday Night Live* grads Fey, Poehler, and Ferrell to grab $135M combined for *Sisters* and *Daddy's Home* (the SNLers are apparently feeling very familial this winter). Yes, *Sisters* opens head-to-head against *Star Wars*, which sounds crazy stupid, but besides the thousands of moviegoers who happen to say ""Sith Lord"" while in line and are given tickets to *Sisters*, it's also perfect counter-programming.

As tough as it is for us to understand, there is a large part of the population that gives something less than a complete rat's ass about *Star Wars*, and wouldn't know a Skywalker from a streetwalker. *They* are *Sisters* audience, and they will go watch those wacky ladies, if only for the joy of strolling leisurely past the hordes of desperately impatient, line-locked ""space movie geeks."" 

Cap off Tom's season with a final bargain in $70M from $6 *Daddy's Home*, and that should be enough to walk away with the 2015 Winter Movie Draft championship.

&amp;nbsp;

(Or, there's always the chance that Star Wars makes a billion dollars in a week-an-a-half and nothing else means anything.)

I am new to the Reddit community so please bare with me.

I am currently finishing up my Senior year at Macalester College with a Biology major and I have become increasingly worried about my qualifications going forward to Entry Level MSN programs. I eventually want to become a Nurse Midwife and Family Nurse Practitioner, but I'm worried that I may not be able to get into grad school.

What I am most worried about is my low GPA (3.15, science GPA is 3.33) and probably low GRE since I haven't been able to study very much (taking it in two weeks). I had a very shitty Freshman year due to family responsibilities (only child of an immigrant family) but have steadily picked up on mostly Bs and some As in Sophomore and Junior year. I have no research experience outside of lab but have had multiple medical internships with audiologists, oncologists, physical therapists, and women's health nurse practitioners throughout college trying to figure out what I want to do. I am currently a medical scribe in the emergency room, I love working there, but I'm afraid my grades are slipping again because of the time commitment and fatigue along with family responsibilities.

My question is, how likely am I going to get into an Entry to MSN program with a low GPA and GRE but great medical experience? I am trying my hardest to write the best personal statements of my life. Two of my professors and a physician I work with have agreed to write recommendation letters for me, but should I suggest that they speak about my GPA? How do I go about doing that? 

It's 4 in the morning here and I am just palpating outta my chest from stress. I mainly need reassurance and also realistic news (such as, ""Alright, you ain't getting in"") so I can move on from this thought with some kind of determination. 


Thank you for reading! :)  "

I recently came out to my father as gay and he freaked out. It's been 4 months and there is no sign of him changing his mind about being in my life. 

I pay for school with financial aid and what that doesn't cover I use student loans. I wait tables on weekends but unfortunately I'm in an unpaid internship program now, that is really taking up more of my time than I need for it to. But I get credit for it. 

I cannot afford to take out anymore loans. 

After my dad stopped helping with rent, power, cell phone, Internet, etc.  I was okay a while just always behind or late which is more expensive. 

My car was in my fathers name and he had an extra key and came and got it one night without telling me. So I can't travel very far from home. I bike/walk to work and school. 

I was hoping someone out there would have the know how, to get caught up during Christmas break. Anything will help I'm sure! I need to raise/make approximately $1,500-$2,000 before January. 

This would catch me up as far as 2.5 months rent, 2 power bills, 2 cellphone bills and 3 internet bills and groceries for a while. 

I had a suggestion for cutting off my internet and using cellular data. I did cut back my cellphone  plan and cancelled my Hulu, Netflix and other luxury expenses. But I can not cancel my internet, it's to big of a necessity for school. 

I really hope to get a lot of feed back. I can't really go home if I don't find a solution.  

Thanks in advance! "

Fast forward six months and I am absolutely miserable. I have always struggled with anxiety to an extent, but it is now eating me alive. Aside from the intense misery I feel about it, I feel it is also affecting my job performance and I don't think I am doing a good job. I have felt this way for 3 months and I am slowly getting more and more depressed as well as anxious, like tonight I cried for 2 hours thinking about going to work tomorrow.

The amount of stress in the job is insane, and I hate feeling inadequate. I hate the work, I hate the culture, and I am becoming less and less interested in pursuing law as a career.

It sounds ridiculous, but I live in a fifth storey apartment and I frequently think about how I could end it all and stop going to the job. I have started self-medicating with alcohol to give my mind a break from how stressed I am all the time.

I am, however, afraid that it is my anxiety talking and if I were to quit, I would 'recover' and regret throwing away this opportunity.

On the other hand, I have $25,000 in savings and my friend has offered me a job at a cafe. I would like to explore starting my own business or working in a different type of law job. I want more freedom and less stress than this job will ever offer me. If they were to offer me a job at the end of this period I would run away screaming.

What should I do?"

I was elated when I found this sub and I am so thankful for the positivity and community here. Not talking about my situation is making me crazy! 


I've been with my husband for 5+ years. Happily married-ish. Our bedroom is kinda dead. He travels every week in medical sales. And our interactions during the week are usually only about money or bills or just general operations of our lives. It burns me out. He gets home every weekend and is so tired and so grouchy and rarely does anything sweet for me. He's also terribly timid in bed. Very vanilla. 


I cheated. Last week. I knew it was coming, I knew it from the first day we met. 


We both got jobs working for a new startup in town, and we were connected through a mutual friend. After talking to him for 5 minutes I was hooked. I referred him to my boss for a position and he hadn't even applied. My boss offered him the job - and it took him two weeks to accept it, he said he was weighing his options. Between the offer and the acceptance, we saw one another a lot. I kept making excuses to swing by his work, and since we have mutual friends who also work there - I camouflaged it with visiting them. He's very high up in his current job and it is so sexy. He knows everyone and it always telling jokes and can connect you with anyone you need to know. His smile literally glows and his laugh is infectious. He winks a lot and is a touchy feely kinda guy - to everyone. He's just addicting, can't you tell?


After he accepted the job, we met for drinks a few times. One night we ended up eating and staying out until 1am, just talking. I would come home and touch myself just thinking about him. I would be so embarassed like, ""this guy would think I'm crazy!"" 


Since we are both working for a new company, we don't have an office yet - we are in the process of getting that setup here - and he had a high profile job he was leaving to take the position so for about two weeks - I was the only person in real life who knew about the new job. So it became like summer camp. We constantly wanted to get together to talk shop and ideas. Every single day we would text and atleast try to hang out. 


I realized very quickly he wasn't happy at home. Who gets a new job and doesn't tell their wife?!? He said he didn't want to upset her if the offer wasn't high enough - essentially wanted all the details ironed out and then he will tell her. He never talks about her. Talks about his kids (did I mention he has kids?) all the time. But her, never - which was very telling to me. (She knows now)


Throughout this process we have always been very flirty making sexy jokes or talking about breasts or whatever - like guy humor. So I've always kind enjoyed our banter. Two weeks ago we were out and he had to go to his office to hit a deadline before midnight - so we had been drinking and talking shop from about 8-11pm and he stood up to leave and kissed me on the cheek. I froze, but I was so insanely turned on. It turned into to awkward hug thing and he said ""isn't it funny these people probably think I'm fucking you."" Well, there it was. I grinned and felt my crotch moisten in literally 1 second. 


We continued having casual interactions and he even met up with me and my girl friends one night when we went dancing. He loves to party and have a good time and they all knew him as my coworker. As the drinks kept flowing I felt his hand on my lower back and it would take my breath away. We danced to one song and I caught myself trying to rub my ass all over his crotch. Oops. We stayed out until 6am and I was fairly drunk. We started texting at 9am the following morning and that was two weeks ago and it hasn't stopped. 


As our company continues to lay groundwork - we continue to work together as we can. We have tasks but they're so abstract but we always get them done and then stay later to flirt. Last week we had a fundraiser to attend to represent the new company. We got there late but split a bottle of wine. Then the entire group, all friends of ours, went out to a bar. Slowly people trickled out and we kept talking about work and flirting a little. Finally it was last call, and I decided I drank to much, and insisted on some greasy White Castle before I headed home. 


I rode with him to the bar - along with others, but at this point it was just the two of us. On the way to get a burger he flat out asked me ""What are you thinking?"" 
""I'm hungry is what I'm thinking."" - he pulls over, ""no, what are you really thinking about what's going on between us?""


I froze and took a deep deep breath. ""I'm thinking things I shouldn't be thinking."" He smiled, ""Me too.""


At this point I'm done for. Just done. I know I cannot resist him. We go through the drive thru and he puts his hand on my knee. I love it. And I feel myself getting so wet and my breathing was insane. 


We continue silly flirting the entire way back to my car and he parks behind me on the street. I continue to eat and joke and after a sip of drink he grabs my face and kisses me. So hard and passionately it makes me sweat just thinking about it. We pull away and both make a statement like ""what are we doing?!"" But we both knew what we are doing. 


We make out some more and his hands are everywhere. He feels over my crotch and stops, looks at me and I grin. He felt how wet I was because it was coming through my damn pants. I guided his hand down the front of my pants and he lost his mind. ""How are you so wet, WHAT!"" He couldn't keep his hands off my clit and by this point I was rubbing him through his jeans. He made me cum in 2 minutes. ""Your turn."" I said as I decided to give him head. His dick was beautiful. Not too big but a good thickness. He came very quickly and very hard. We were like animals, panting.


After that we both straighten up in our seats and he very clearly said ""you gotta get out."" I kinda freaked like, did I do something wrong? - ""You gotta go because I want to fuck you so bad."" - I smiled and hopped out.


We saw one another the next afternoon at a luncheon. Acted totally normal. Then he called me after ""you gonna be awkward around me now?"" I said ""nope."" And he said ""Even though I still want to fuck you?"" And I replied ""The feeling is mutual."" We didn't discuss it again for 3 days.


We had an event two nights ago to attend for work and we were meeting some interns to discuss things with them. I sent them to dinner early and said I would meet them in a second. He and I were standing in the middle of our busy downtown and as soon as they were out of earshot he looked at me, ""I cannot get you out of my head."" I grinned ""I know, you've got me worked up."" We talked in this sexy banter as we walked to dinner and stood outside the restaurant for 5 minutes discussing how turned on we both were. He had to run to another meeting - so I was handling the interns, we hugged goodbye and he whispered ""just talking to you makes me so hard."" Kissed my ear and left.


I didn't hear a word the interns said. I don't even remember. Because we started furiously texting, filthy. After his meeting we met up and had a similar encounter as before. We were just more sober and more comfortable so it was even better. 


Saw him yesterday morning, and although his current company is casual, they had meetings yesterday so he was dressed up. And I was raging hot. Watching him work was so hot. Shit. When I left we started texting and it didn't stop until we met up that evening. The day was full of fantasy and pictures and steamy stuff. And he came by the bar I was at. Sat down, didn't order a drink but just spoke to me about what he wanted to do to me. We pretended to be having a professional conversation. But it was far from it. He left after 10 minutes. TEASE. And I closed out and went outside and he was sitting in his car stroking it. I climbed in - we drove around the block and I give him the most intense blow job - ""Now you can go to your meeting..."" I said. He laughed and kissed me. Wow.


That was 12 hours ago and I cannot quit thinking about it.
We are planning to get a hotel this weekend and once next week.
The idea of not being in a car and not having any distractions makes me flustered.


 I know work relations isn't advisable so please spare me. We are both more independent contractors right now than brick and mortar coworkers. Just wanted to share. 


We are shifting our talks to Kik today. Any more advice?

ANYWAYS.  The week so far has been meh.  Since it's almost Christmas, a lot of people are on leave so it's been quiet.  On Monday when I came in for work, I was told that I had won November's safety awareness thing.

Every month, they choose 3 of the best health and safety thing and give each person who won a 50$ voucher and honestly, I did try my best 'cause 50$ is quite a bit of money so yea, I tried and every month different people would get it so I thought I had a chance.  But eventually, the same people kept winning so I guess everyone, including me, just like slacked off and just really stopped caring after a while.

Ok, I'm rambling.  

The point is, I won!  lol at least I can cross that off my list ahaha It really was one of my aims to get one so I'm glad I did!  Even though it was done half-heartedly lol I never really win anything so that was a nice surprise!  I'm gonna give it to Mum and Dad to use when they go buy groceries.  50$ is too much just for me to spend so I might as well give it to them to buy stuff for the house and siblings.  If it was broken down in like 10s or 20s I would buy a few things but I can't ""break"" it.  It's cool.  We can just buy more pie pans so I can have more pie!  Easy!

Other than that, nothing has been happening.  Saw an old buddy of mine and we chatted for a bit.  We were under the same program as apprentices but he started a few months before me but was under an unpaid internship I believe before he got picked up by this apprenticeship program.  That was cool.  I told him I'm thinking of going diving sometime in the next few months and he said he'd love to go but he has to make sure it's cool with his girlfriend and make sure he can afford it.  I did tell him to just bring her along if she wanted to come and to let me know if he could afford it so we can plan it more accordingly.  If not then it would be just me and probably family.  They don't dive though so I told them to plan something else for themselves so they don't get bored.

Haven't played much Hearthstone.  Like just to do my dailies but I'm really just waiting for Tavern Brawl and the next wing in League of Explorers.  IT'S TAKING FOREVER.  WHY.  Ok, ok.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow is Tavern Brawl then Friday is League of Explorers.  Soon.  SOON.

I'm meeting a couple of friends tomorrow for dinner.  Haven't seen either of them for a while so it would be nice to catch up.  Not sure if anyone else will be there actually.  Not that it matters lol I just want food ahaha

Oh, I've been reminiscing about Game of Thrones lately lol Like I remembered about stuff that happened all of a sudden so I started looking at Game of Thrones stuff.  Pictures.  Videos.  The books.  The maps.  GIFS.  Anything really lol I think I got a bit over emotional when it showed Robb ugh And Oberyn.  Ok.  I am gonna have a Game of Thrones marathon soon.  Be it the show or the books, I don't care.  I just need to fill this ache I have about it!

So yea.  This has gotten a bit long but, it's a diary entry right?  lol just some of my feelings and thoughts on things.  I'll end here.  

Goodnight, Reddit Diary!"

3w3f1y,2,2015-12-09,Help me understand my process?,prettylittlearrow,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/3w3f1y/help_me_understand_my_process/,"Been lurking for awhile and thought it was time for a post :) Like many people I'm still not sure if I'm an INFJ or not. I've taken the actual Myers-Briggs twice. In high school as a senior 3 years ago, and I got INTJ. I took it again last year as a sophomore and got INFJ. Whenever I take the short online quizzes I get some variation of INFJ/INFP/ENFP/ENFJ. I did some reading and one of the [fundamental differences is the decision making process.](http://www.personalityhacker.com/infp-vs-infj/) I'm currently in a dilemma where I have to make a fairly big decision and so I thought-- maybe if I explained how I'm thinking, I could get some outside feedback on what type of decision making I'm using. (And yes I probably would be better off talking to a professional but I don't have the resources right now to talk to my counselor about it).

I'll make the backstory short: Went off to college (ABC University) during a rough period in my life and was not happy about the school I was going to (it was my last choice, parents basically chose it for me, etc). Hated it all the first semester and planned on transferring somewhere else in-state after my first year was up. Circumstances changed and I went back for another semester and by the time it was over I realized that I had it pretty damn great (guy I liked, good roommates/friends, amazing job, grades were great, seeing a good counselor), but I still wanted something ""different"". Transferred somewhere else (XYZ University). Had a ROUGH semester there and am afraid to go back. More circumstances and I ended up staying home a semester; I've had MONTHS to think about this. My thinking so far:

**Continue at XYZ University:**
- I want to go back because I feel like 1 semester isn't a good enough period to know if I like it or not; I hated the first school and ended up loving it, so maybe that's the case here. I WANT to love it there.
- Joined a group and while it wasn't what I expected I would feel guilty for ""wasting"" my parents' money, letting the group down, and quitting something. I was raised to always finish what you start and I would feel bad for others wasting their time and for myself for quitting.
- I'm afraid to go back because the drinking environment wasn't at all right for me and I got too caught up in it...BUT now I do now that it's not for me and can avoid the mistakes I made. 
- I don't have very many friends and will feel alone, but with a different major I could still make friends.
- Still opportunities to join activities.
- Had a bad experience with random roommates and I don't want to live alone...but I don't have anyone I could live with.
- MUCH cheaper than my other school, but I am a year behind and would have to stay a 5th year.
- I have work study so getting a job isn't a problem.

**Go back to ABC University:**
- Would feel awkward having to explain to everyone why I decided to come back and why I lied about LOVING XYZ Uni when I was actually miserable and hungover 99% of the time.
- It feels like home, and it's in a major city meaning I don't have to spend all of my time on campus.
- Not many opportunities to join outside activities but being in a city means I could intern and join things outside of school.
- My absolute best friends, as well as someone I'm in love with (but not involved with), are there and I cherish them more than anything.
- I could potentially get my amazing job back or find something equally as good with the amount of connections I have there.
- INSANELY expensive and not sure I can afford to pay back the loans.
- I'm very close to graduating on time and would possibly only need to stay an extra semester as opposed to another year. Plus I want to graduate with my friends.


I'm NOT asking you to help me with my decision (though if you have some worldly advice I would not be opposed to it); I'm asking what kind of decision processing is this? INFJ ""Harmonizing"" or INFP ""Authorizing""? I'm just feeling torn between what's logical and what will make the most sense in the long run vs. what's best for me RIGHT NOW.

Edit: formatting my bad lol

3w3mnh,1,2015-12-09,Accepting a job after college,raider_galaxy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3w3mnh/accepting_a_job_after_college/,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I am currently a senior in college and I will be graduating in May with a computer engineering degree. My grades are strong and I have internship experience on my resume. The problem that I am facing is that I have been interviewing for jobs and I am not exactly sure how to evaluate the offers I have been receiving. So far I have received 3 job offers, but only one is still valid.

The job offer that is still currently on the table is as follows, 68k + 5k signing + 4% IRA match + 7% bonus based on company performance. The company as a whole is not performing great, but I would be working for a small (somewhat self-sufficient group) within the company where only the benefits would be affected by the larger company. The location that I would be working in is outside of Chicago.

The issue that I am worried about is that I am afraid to turn down this offer and start over looking for jobs again. I am a good student with a good resume but I sometimes struggle with technical interviews. The offer that I still have is the second best offer that I received in terms of compensation and benefits, but the work is the best (which is why I turned down the best offer). I'm just looking for some advice as to either taking this job or searching for a different one.

Thanks

As a side note, I have already tried to negotiate with the company, and they said they already gave me the top of their budget and the offer is as stands. This slightly worries me that there is not a lot of growth potential with the company."

I graduated about two years ago. I was working in customer service (cashier) for a while. Passed P last November. Passed FM this Aug. Took MFE and failed this November. 

Before I had taken any exams, everyone said you only needed one. Then two. Now three. I know it has to do with increasing competitiveness, but it's seriously discouraging me.

I didn't take undergrad seriously, so I didn't do any internships or anything. I graduated with a low but decent GPA. I'm trying to develop my skills using Tia's technical skills course. 

Currently I've been applying to any and every job I can. Some analyst roles. Claims. Etc. I get some interest, but no real offers. I don't know what to do.

So... What do you think is better? Keep applying for any position? Take a job as a data entry clerk from a temp agency? Take MFE next year and reapply for actuarial positions? Or go to a no name grad school nearby and try to land a summer internship?

3w3zo6,6,2015-12-09,Seeking advice on how to get money together to pay lawyer fees as a college student without consistent income,LaneCake,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3w3zo6/seeking_advice_on_how_to_get_money_together_to/,"I am a 21 year old female college student in my junior year of my undergraduate studies, and my boyfriend is a 20 year old college student who is also a junior in his undergraduate studies. Last night we were both arrested for possession of controlled substances. This was the first time that either of us has been arrested. I received two misdemeanors, and he received two felonies and two misdemeanors. The whole ordeal was entirely my fault, so I have told him that I will be paying both of our legal fees. After speaking with a couple friends who have faced similar cases in the past, I am expecting that my legal fees will cost something like $5k, and his will cost something like $20k or $25k after hiring lawyers and paying all fines and taking all recommended/required classes. So, that's $25k to $30k all together. I currently have $3k in savings, $2k tied up in CD's, and $3k in a Roth IRA account that I can withdraw without penalty. My parents have the paperwork for another bank account in my name that was given to me by my grandparents, and intended for use on my first down payment on a house whenever I graduate and get a full time job. I believe that it contains $30k or $40k. I have not told my parents about what happened, so I currently do not have access to this money. Our court dates are on January 26th, so I would need to at least have the money to pay both of our lawyers well in advance of that date. For this reason, I am expecting that I will need to take out a loan. First of all, I know very little about loans, or what goes into getting approved for them. I do know that when my same grandparents gave me a bank account to be used to buy a car when I graduated from high school (they are very generous people), I took out a short term loan in my name and paid it back with the money from that account in order to build my credit. The last time I saw my credit score, it was exceptionally high. I want to handle all of this on my own if at all possible, without telling my parents. I plan on starting to sell my plasma, and getting a part time job once I get back from winter break (finals week is next week for us). I plan on applying to work at a hotel some time this week, so I'm hoping that I will be hired by them in time to be able to report that I am employed when I apply for the loan. I have an internship this summer that will be paying me very well, and they did my background check a while ago, so I don't see my employment status with them being any kind of issue. I also plan on getting a night job over the summer, such as waitressing. With time, I will certainly be able to pay off any kind of debt. I am a very motivated and hardworking person, so I plan on doing everything in my power to fix this, both legally and monetarily, for the two of us. Can anyone offer advice on where to start on getting this money together? I am young and clueless and I need as much advice as I can get moving forward. Thank you in advance!"

In case someone asks, no, she didn't follow me here. It's a great school for our respective majors. 

We both are commuters, roughly ~40 minutes one way. I took this most recent Fall semester off to intern at a big tech company, and planned on using some of the money to rent a bedroom near campus. 

So I came back from my internship in late November, and have been looking for a room near campus every since. I'm interested in subleasing a room for the Spring semester. The problem is there really aren't many options available. The best room I could find is in a 4 bedroom apartment right next to campus. The price is right, and the location is great. 

However, my girlfriend isn't happy with my potential roommates. They are as follows: a 19 year old female student, a 23 year old female fresh grad, and a 22 year old male grad student. I've met them all, and they seem like respectable individuals. Both girls have boyfriends, and the guy is single. 

She does not like the idea of me living with other females. When I told her I am considering signing the sublease, she became very upset and quiet. She says it's ""fucking weird"" that I will be living with two other girls, and has been upset about this for the past couple of days. When I ask her what makes it weird, she doesn't give me any specifics and says, ""everything about it."" 

Here's the thing, our relationship is good. We both trust each other, and we're good about communicating our feelings. But in this instance she's not telling me what about this living situation is ""weird."" I know the idea of it is making her uncomfortable and she'd rather I live with all guys. She's not preventing me from signing the lease, but she is seriously upset that I want to sign it. I told her that if I were to live there, I'd make sure to tell her about everything and make sure she never feels uncomfortable.

I want the sign the lease because I have 3 semesters left before graduating, and really want to live near campus for all of them. I'm 100% sure I won't find a room if I don't sign this lease. After the Spring semester is over, I'd look for an apartment with all guys.  Am I in the wrong for wanting to go through with this?

   
**tl;dr**: Want to rent a bedroom near campus for 5 months, roommates would be 2 females and 1 male, girlfriend is upset that I might be living with females. Am I wrong for wanting to live there?"

I recently started meds for anxiety/depression but only ironically, this past monday was my first day, so they haven't kicked in yet. 

I had an internship in a lab in a brewery and I had asked my bosses if I could stay on permanently. They said they were excited about that idea but just needed to talk to the general manager. They extended my internship by a month and a half but then on monday, broke the news that they decided to go with someone with more experience... the thiing is, they basically had to make a position for me, there wasn't really enough work for one person, and the manager had to be convinced, so after all that work and seeing me work there I guess they decided I wasn't good enough? It was definitely a lay off, not a firing, and they both offered to write me good references. But I feel like total crap, especialy because I did get fired from my last job in the field I went to school for (was in the biotech path, hated it, changed fields to beer). Im just so upset becuase they KNEW for at least a few weeks they were looking for other people and they didn't tell me. I could have been looking harder for jobs! (I did have two interviews that I haven't heard back from yet). I feel really betrayed.
I feel so incompetent. I left a phd program because I thought I was doing the right thing by following my heart.

I also have over 140k in student loans. Yes, I know I was stupid, yes I regret it everyday, but its too late. Im stuck. Over half are private too.
Im calling them all today to beg for a forebearance for two months but I can't gaurantee I will get it.

Now I find out that my fiance isn't doing so hot at his job. Hes made some mistakes and his boss is not happy with him. If he loses that job we won't have any income.

Im sitting here, supposed to be looking for jobs, but I just want to cry all the time. I feel like I failed at my life in such a big way its irreversable.

To make matters worse I recently had health problems come up and had to pay out of pocket for 300-500 dollars (don't know how much the bill will be for the labwork yet). 
I just feel so defeated.

3w4d9g,1,2015-12-09,Employer is paying me to get off the couch,aromogato,whichbike,https://www.reddit.com/r/whichbike/comments/3w4d9g/employer_is_paying_me_to_get_off_the_couch/,"Like a lot of other posters in this subreddit, I want to get a bike to ride to work. My employer is letting me reimburse some of the cost, so this seems like a no brainer. During my internship a few years ago I rented a road bike to travel to work and it was an amazing experience due to the speed and lightness of the bike. Because of this I would prefer a road bike to a commuter bike.

Experience: Three years ago when I had a summer internship I rode to and back from the office ~15 miles roundtrip. Not much serious biking before or after that. Currently, I'm in fair to poor athletic condition, but I want to change that as I get into biking! I'm 5'7"" 190lbs if that is relevant.

Price range: My employer gives me a yearly fitness budget of which I have $550 left. I'd like to stay as close to that number as possible but am willing to go up to $750. Because this is through my company, I need a receipt when I buy the bike so used bikes off craigslist are not going to be feasible.

Intention with the bike: I'm going to use it to commute back and forth from work.

How far and how often will you ride: Work is 11 miles one way. Probably will start by doing one way 2-3 times a week and will increase it as I get more fit.

Riding conditions: Road/pavement the whole way. There's 800ft elevation gain and 700ft elevation loss (it's reversed on the way back obviously). Traffic will not be too bad because most of it follows the highway. The weather is typical Seattle weather - rains a lot but doesn't get extremely cold.

Location: Seattle

I've looked on amazon, but there just seems to be too many options which I can't properly compare (I don't have much experience with bike parts). I also checked out diamondback's site (I get a discount on some of their bikes) and I saw the following bikes for what seems to be a good price:

[$750 - Haanjo Comp](http://www.diamondback.com/bikes-road-alternative-road-haanjo-comp)

[$500 - Century](http://www.diamondback.com/bikes-road-endurance-century)

3w4rw6,64,2015-12-09,My Love for Game Grumps ended with a fizzle. (Long Rant),AlternateButtons,rantgrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/rantgrumps/comments/3w4rw6/my_love_for_game_grumps_ended_with_a_fizzle_long/,"After about two or three years of being a Grump fan, I finally unsubbed from their channel. It wasn't a momentous occasion. It wasn't huge or an explosion of rage and anger. It just kind of...ended. 

I unsubbed when Bloodborne returned. Why? Because Galaxy ended and I was excited to see what new things they had in store. I wanted to know what journey they were going to take next and after the loooong and drawn out series they've been putting out recently, I desperately wanted something new.

But then I saw Bloodborne and it was just kind of like ""Oh.....alright then."" And in that moment I thought to myself ""Y'know, the reason why I've been subbed to the Grumps for so long despite the huge drop in quality is because I've always held out hope that they'll get better and be as good as I know they can be. But it's clear that they don't WANT to get better. They're content with what they're putting out and they'll never change. So I think I'm done. I'm moving on."" and unsubbed without a second thought. 

It's disappointing really. Here's the channel that inspired my friend and I to make our own Let's Play channel and yet here I was, just leaving as a fan. I think the worst part is, is that I KNOW they can be funny. I know they can make me laugh if they actually put effort into their work. But they don't. They're content with the repetitive jokes, the lazy and sometimes under par editing. They're content with putting on these characters they've made for themselves and losing the genuine feel of their show. They're content with mediocrity. 

I'm posting this because I just took a lookback at their channel to see what they're up to and....it's a fucking mess. 

When Game Grumps started it was just two friends playing games. It was a simple formula that was genuine and entertaining. Just two friends being goofballs. That's it. I was fine when the roster expanded to Ross and Danny because it still felt genuine and fun. But then they just kept adding people and adding interns and adding editors. Now we have SEVEN people, (including Kevin because they count him) and most of them don't even work well with each other. Some of their interactions just seem mean and uncalled for. 

I can't even begin to tell you how angry it makes me when they pick on Ross. Look, ""God Dammit Ross"" was funny when Danny did it. But they treat him like literal shit. Brian especially with his cocky arrogance. I can't STAND Brian's arrogant ""I have a Ph'd"" attitude. He reminds me of that shitty friend that thinks he's better than you at everything because he has better grades or is better off. It's just not funny and it's mean spirited to the Nth degree. 

But don't you think seven people is a bit much? The original Grump show doesn't even feel special anymore. It just feels like it's there simply because it HAS to be and because it's their name. Arin and Danny have lost any sort of chemistry they once had. It's non-existent now. Danny himself is just ALWAYS fucking tired and uninterested. Arin puts on this shitty rage character that has no genuine qualities about it and is just an act because it's what's popular for views. Barry is awkward as fuck on camera with his slurred speech and doesn't seem invested at all. Suzy comes off as an ungrateful, whiny child who's humor does NOT fit in with anything they do, Brian as I mentioned is an asshole. Kevin is the LAZIEST son of a bitch I've ever seen in my life (Seriously I could edit circles around him.) and poor Ross is the only one with a lick of humor to him that is just sandwiched between all of these negative people. (Seriously, he deserves better. Here's hoping Gameoververse works out.)

I mean is THIS what Game Grumps is? It just seems like such a hollow shit show with no focus and no care put into it. It's not even recognizable anymore! Look guys, I'm not saying change is a bad thing. If you don't change and keep doing the same thing until the end of time, you will burn out. But this is not how change should be handled. 

When you change, you always need to keep in mind what worked in the first place. In Game Grumps case, it was the genuine, two best friends having a good time aspect that drew people in. But now it's just a cluster fuck of fake characters to appeal to a mainstream teen audience. There's no magic anymore.

It's like Mario and Sonic now that I think of it. Think about it. Mario games work because they keep what works best. Jumping and platforming with game mechanics revolving around jumping and platforming. Anything added to the formula is meant to compliment the main aspect and that's why Mario has barely any bad games. Sonic on the other hand kept trying to throw in game mechanics like no tomorrow. You had pointless treasure hunting, shoot 'em ups, Werehogs, Psychic Hedgehogs, the list just goes on. And every single one of those gameplay mechanics I mentioned were easily the worst parts of those respective games. People just want to see Sonic run fast and when Sega evolves that aspect alone, it makes for a good Sonic game hence Colors, Generations and the original trilogy. Sonic Lost World was a fuck up because they once again deviated away from the main aspect and added too much experimentation to something that WORKED. 

And Game Grumps is no different in this regard. They just keep throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. 

Evolve what works. That's the lesson they should learn. But they never will. And that's why I left and will never come back. Game Grumps is just a name now. There's no meaning behind it anymore. 

Sorry for the long rant. I only intended for this to be a be a few paragraphs believe it or not. 

**So TL;DR** I left Game Grumps because they're content with mediocrity, are evolving in all the wrong ways and will never change to the quality they once were.

My issue? I stress about everything, and the stressing makes me feel so angry and so upset and so sad. I don't know if I have anxiety or depression or maybe both but I don't want to be the 'woe is me' kind of person and self-diagnose.

My mother stresses me to no end. She constantly says she loves me and is only watching out for me, and I know she does not intentionally stress me out, but she does. She gets mad at almost everything I do (at least I am interpreting it this way) but said she is not ever really mad. I say sorry for almost anything I do (not only to her) because I feel like I everything I do is wrong.

A few years back, I was as shy as shy can be. I was almost worried I had social anxiety. Then in the past year or two I sort of 'came out of my shell'. I am still incredibly shy, but less so than before. I started going out more, doing things, making more friends, but last year, one of my best friends decided to just cut ties and now I don't do much. I go out with my boyfriend, go to our friends' house, but not *out*. 

I've been doing my first internship (teaching) for the past 6 weeks and it's been brutal. Assignments and reports due for theory part made everything more stressful. I haven't been working during this period, so I haven't made any money in over a month.

I tried to quit my job a few weeks back but realised I had no other job to fall back on so I got someone to take off my two week notice from the board in the office.

My mother also tells me I need to go out more and do more things. But I am broke! Furthermore, she complains when I am never home to take care of the cat and dog, and how I do nothing around the house. Does she want me out doing things or at home doing things, then? I am not entirely sure what she wants.

I cannot balance anything. I rarely see my other friends outside of the two I go see with my boyfriend. I can't balance social time with friends, social time with family, work, school, internship, my relationship with my boyfriend...

I can't. I am so tired and I just can't. I want help but don't know where to begin. I will try to get an appointment with my school counselor and see how that goes.

I am hypersensitive and take everything everyone says to heart. Whether it is a joke or not, I will take offence. Most of the time (85%) I will cry about it. I can't help it. 

I don't hear 'voices' per se, but I catch myself always 'telling' myself: ""you are useless, you are ugly, you are annoying. What are you good for? Why are you living?"" Yet I can't kill myself because I'm scared. Humans tend to be scared of the unknown. What if death is worse than living? What if a greater pain awaits me upon dying? I don't want to know. 

I don't want to kill myself, but yet I do. But I am scared. I know I won't be able to do it, but I wish I could. I wish I could run away from everything.

Oh, I can't talk to my mom about any of this, nor my dad; they would get so mad. The typical ""well, when I was your age..."" or even ""you are in school, have a job and a boyfriend, you live in a house with a roof over your head..."" blah blah so why should I feel the way I feel, right? What do I know?! I'm just a stupid almost 21 year old kid that knows nothing, right?!

I am so tired!!!! Mentally, physically. No matter how much I sleep I am still so fucking goddamned tired and I just want to scream and punch something or slam my head against a wall I just want this pain to end! I can't take it anymore I'm at my breaking point but I guess it's not important since I have no intention of kiling myself right?!

I hate this so much I really do the world is a fucking horrid place and I wish I could just vanish into thin air and never take another fucking breath on this planet.

Edit: sorry if my thoughts are all over the place and sorry for the ending of this post becoming sort of less coherent I guess I gradually got more and more emotional, lol."
3w5pwa,54,2015-12-09,"1Ls - you're going to be fine. If you don't believe me, take a break from finals, make some tea, and listen to my tale",PM_ME_PLATYPUS_TALES,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/3w5pwa/1ls_youre_going_to_be_fine_if_you_dont_believe_me/,"Hello everyone.  Throwaway account, but it's that time of year where everyone's freaking out and I really wanted to share my experience, or at the least an anecdote to help people put things in perspective.

When I began law school, I had been out of school for a few years, having just returned from teaching English and sports (basically PE) overseas in a few countries where I spoke the native language.  The transition for me was immense.  Not only was I re-adjusting back to the US, but it was in a city I had never lived in before, nor knew anybody in.  

My first semester 1L was, well, probably the hardest time of my life.  New adjustments, a new life, difficult coursework, and all of the normal things 1L year would bring you.  

Except... I got arrested about a month into school starting (not a DWI, something pretty minor) but significant enough where I had to obviously amend applications, the law school freaked, put me on probation.... it really jarred me.  Ontop of knowing nobody, feeling desperately alone... wondering if I'd seriously jeopardized my future.

Then I met someone.  The most beautiful, kindest person I'd ever met.  They helped me out of the rut I was in, made me feel good about myself after the arrest and we dated for awhile my first semester.  Until I contracted an incurable STD from them (that they say they didn't know they had, but who knows).  So my life was jarred... *again*... in a completely different way.  They broke it off with me almost immediately after.  I guess they couldn't live with the guilt.  This happened like mid-November my first semester 1L year.  Doctor's appointments, learning about prescriptions, how to manage this, how it will affect my life, dating, etc... On top of school, and still feeling shitty after the arrest.  

And then the beginning of December my first semester 1L, my car was totaled in the parking lot of my apartment complex after a drunk driver rammed into it, and I lived far away from the school and needed to get a rental car somehow to make the commute, couldn't afford a new car.  Oh and I should also mention that I had left my notebooks in my gym bag in the back seat but the crash had hit the side where the seat was, so it basically ruined all of my notes from the entire semester.  

I was a nervous, depressed, frightened mess of a person.  Exams were like the next week.  Yeah, I studied, as well as I could given the circumstances and how rattled my brain was.  Scored dead median.  The next semester, I knew I had to do better, ended up top 10% of my class (for that semester, so ended up around 1/3).

Went off to have a successful OCI that summer.  Point is, guys, life throws us curveballs all the time and it's going to seem extremely difficult, maybe even impossible to get through it but... you will.  I remember telling myself after my diagnosis that, well... the sun's still gonna come up tomorrow.  And during exams, hell, even if I just copy and paste a million lenny faces into the exam, the world's still gonna spin.

Now, the rest of my tale doesn't end so hot, but this point of this post was grades, studying, and how everyone's gonna make it.  As for me, I had worked for a law firm my 2L summer and made great money but the firm couldn't hire me due to financial reasons.  Panicked obviously, did a few in-year internships... nada, no job.  Still couldn't even get a job after the bar.  

After months of a fruitless search and volunteering my time to various legal aid, I ended up forming a band - we play country music.  I play guitar/sing.  I've got a sick beard now and grew my hair out, but I wear a baseball cap or cowboy hat most of the time now anyway.  We basically drive around about 60% of the country in a beat-up pick-up truck hitting college towns and small towns to play music living off what we get paid.  I drink a lot now, and smoke cigarettes more than ever.  Started out with just covering ""Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound"" and ""I Think I'll Just Sit Here and Drink"" but we have some original stuff now too. 

Good luck to everyone during this finals season and beyond.  God Bless.

3w6bvy,2,2015-12-09,"[F4M] Hate me, fuck me, harder, break me Sir!",amy_ginger_28,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3w6bvy/f4m_hate_me_fuck_me_harder_break_me_sir/,"**Hate Sex**

it's the type of sex that's so full of emotional baggage that it pushes your mutual sex to a whole new level.

It's the guy you dated who's a completely asshole and was a mistake from the get go.  You already broke up multiple times but here you are bouncing on his delicious cock.  You can't stand him, you fucking hate his guts but fuck you love his god damn cock buried inside you.

Here's my pitch for a few ideas that I would love to explore further.

---
**The Better Man**:

I heard a lot about you over the years.  First it was the brilliant new junior coworker that's was working with my husband full of potential and promise.  Then slowly over time as you rose in the ranks it turned from what a great new employee we have to what 'that guy' did, to the 'prick' as he fondly referred to you.  You rose faster then anyone at the company.  My husband is a few years older then me, he's 35 years old.  Now, his once former intern of 25 years is the CEO favorite and is likely to be running the company in a few years.  Jason can't fucking stand you and I.. well I barely met you but frankly I'm just fucking tired of hearing him whine about it.  

I just had a fight with Jason and I'm annoyed with him as it is.  I'm wearing a tight fitting little red dress a few inches shorter then what I'd normally wear at work events.  We're all at the work Christmas party as I finally meet 'Marcus'.  A brilliant young man with a radiant smile who bright eyes that seems to take in everything and everyone in the room yet still are able to rapidly roam over my body and leaving me feeling like he's taken in every inch of my body and approves thoroughly of my gym membership and the work I've been putting into it.

At the same time, I can feel the animosity between Jason and Marcus.  

                              . . . 

A few hours later in the VIP lounge that's empty except for the two of us. My dress is in pieces feeling his mouth on my body, roughly handling me and he calls me a little whore and respond in kind.  Our hot sweaty bodies pressed against one another as he finally pins me against the large glass wall over looking the party.  His young powerful cock slamming into my married pussy fucking me as I look down on the large gathering.. somewhere down there my own husband is looking for me as I'm betraying him.....I can feel Marcus hate for Jason....each thrust making me moan and  beg for more.  Each time I hear him call my husband a waste of space, a worthless prick as he's slamming into me again and again.  Pulling my hair, spanking my ass... he's hurting me and the pain is blissful to both of us.

Hours later... several orgasms later I look at Marcus' naked body.... mmmmm, I don't personally hate him...though he's a cocky little fuck.  One thing I know for sure.  I want him to hate Jason as much as he wants especially if he continues to fuck me like that.  I get up on the conference table spreading my legs for him inviting him in for another go.....



-----------
**Father In Law Version**

I've met 'Marcus' several times over the course of my relationship with Jason.  I heard some of the things he'd tell his son but never really directly to me.  I wasn't good enough for his son.  I would destroy his focus, I was a harlot.  Jason studied law and I've met him in my undergrad years.  His father always thought I was a 'distraction' from the vision he had for his son.  The older senator expected his son to follow in his footsteps.  Marcus is a legend in South Carolina.  He's held his seat as Senator for the past 30 years though at this point he's lost the momentum and is far too old to really think of the presidency as an attainable goal.  He was grooming Jason to become just that.

Jason, he adopted son.  He can swing the black votes coming from a proper African american family with strong values.  His hearth felt story of how he never met his real family and such would bring in the soccer moms and in turn a much of the middle class.  

There was a dream damn it 'till that little redheaded whore came into the picture.  Date the girl, fuck the girl... christ gangbang her and her mom and her entire family if you're into it, but don't fucking Marry her!  You marry for power and for politics not for love.

                                  . . .

 I knew how he felt, I knew Marcus hated me....though I'm still trying to piece the events that led me to this... yet here I am my ass red from the spanking he gave me earlier.  I hear him calling me a whore behind me....his cock slamming into me again as all I am able to say in response is letting out a long and loud moan of delight.   I'm on all 4s sitting on the bed like a good little cum puppy feeling Marcus dick slamming into my 'whoring cunt' again and again.  I can feel his hate for me... his distaste at the 'slut'.  I can feel his hands in my hair pulling me back as he uses me again.  ooooooohhhh....yyyessss harder ""Daddy""....

I just need advice on whether this is a reasonable concern to a normal person or just me overthinking things. 

I have anxiety and since summer I have been having headaches. Like consistently, I am currently waiting for a referral to a neurologist but it's slow going. 

I've also been having back pain that I believe is related to a cyst (this is based off of the fact that I have PCOS and I've had cysts in the past.) 

But I'm concerned about something new and I'm afraid to bring it up to my doctor because I don't want her to think I'm a hypochondriac or rather I don't want her to not care about my big problems like my headaches. 

I've had freckles for a long time but I'm concerned now because I think two of them have become slightly raised up? To clarify, these two freckles are not moles but legit freckles. Like the color hasn't changed and they haven't grown as far as I can tell but when I touch them they just feel slightly different. 

Adding to this is that I work at the hospital during the summers as an intern and I often see my doctor while working so I'm afraid if I bring this up to her and it's nothing that she's going to think I'm weird/crazy. 

I also have to figure out if it's worth mentioning to my mom since it's on her insurance and I cannot drive. The same issue pops up with her that I don't want her to think I'm a hypochondriac or bothering her about every little thing. 
   
So is this just my anxiety or  a legitimate problem? The reason I'm worried that this is just my anxiety is because when I first started getting my headaches I kept thinking it was like a brain tumor even though I had no proof. :/

**tl;dr**: I have anxiety that is manifesting itself through my help. Afraid to ask my mom and doctor about a new problem because I don't want them to think my actual issues aren't real. "

I understand that they're busy and everything, but the Summit 4 isn't the only tournament they've uploaded slower than Dota2.TV or other independent channels. Earlier this year there was a lot of heat directed at these channels that distribute and monetize plagarized/stolen content. But everyone agreed that they uploaded VODs quicker. Of course everyone is going to jump to their channels. It's like asking viewers not to watch leaks of trailers or movies. Sure, you provide a better product, but I, like many Dota players are just trying to our fix as fast as possible. 

Please upload faster. You're just losing business if you don't. It is entirely possible to produce quality content fast, considering you have volunteers (interns?), and this is kind of your job. Not a complaint as much as a concern. "

3w7ixc,3,2015-12-10,I started going to counseling.,diffidently,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/3w7ixc/i_started_going_to_counseling/,"The past few months, I've gotten really down with school and a lot of other reasons. I started sleeping a lot more, or not sleeping at all, not eating, missing my classes, doing poorly because I can't concentrate, etc. I've never had bad thoughts, it's just more of me being unmotivated and just breaking down. I made the phone call to talk to the counselor here and I was feeling really good about this.

I had my initial appointment with an intern who did an indepth questionnaire, which went awesome and I felt really good about it. I met with my actual counselor last week and I felt more lost than I ever was. I'm not saying that I have depression, but a half hour into talking to my counselor about past relationships (because that was the last thing that I broke down about), she said I needed to be put on antidepressants. After telling her that I do not want to be put on any medication, she was confused and asked me ""Well what else would you take to get rid of the depressed feelings?""

I felt lost because I felt like she didn't want to take time and help me through what I'm feeling by doing her job to counsel me. She just jumped to the medication. I've been up all night worrying about my appointment that's this afternoon and how she might not hear me out about how I do not want to be put on medication. I don't want to be put with another counselor because then I'd feel bad about leaving her and I feel like she would feel bad about herself, which is what I hate about me because I'm not being selfish enough in this situation. Also, the waiting list is long at my school.

I want to talk to someone but I don't think counseling is right for me, or maybe just her. I just don't know what I should say to her. My walls are up with her and I don't want that to happen because she is suppose to be there to help me break them down and talk to her about what is going on. But if I just keep my walls up, then she won't think there is a problem and she won't bug me about the medication."
3w87jg,5,2015-12-10,How to get the most out of bad internship?,gingerOfMaine,linkedin,https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/3w87jg/how_to_get_the_most_out_of_bad_internship/,"A few years ago I got an internship with a ""non-profit"" on the advice of when of my professors. After the point of no return, it became clear that this was not really a non-profit, but an idea that a lady had and wanted help bringing to life.

Anyway, I did very little in the internship, but what I did do looks pretty good on my LinkedIn, so I have it listed. 

The struggle is that the non-profit never took off. The lady had other things come up in her life and she didn't want to do the hard logistical work that was required to make it into a recognized 503(c). So the non-profit died and doesn't exist anymore.

My question is this: How do I best note this on my LinkedIn? I have the position and the description of the things I did on there already, but I don't think it's appropriate for to just put ""ultimately this failed"" on there. All of the website and social media pages have been taken down, so I can't link to anything.

Any thoughts?"
3w8q83,12,2015-12-10,I need to VENT.,Shellberta,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/3w8q83/i_need_to_vent/,"As an intern for SBC, I too was greatly impacted by the horrific events that took place last week- however, I feel I must speak out about the injustices that those of the Muslim faith or that are now being categorized as Arab (by looks or origin) are facing. Though I was young, I remember 9/11 and the institutionalized and widely accepted discrimination that took place after those events. I think it is important to remember during this difficult time that we should not turn our anger at the situation into hatred or marginalization to groups of people. 

I'm saddened by the events that took place but I am hearing things at internship and school that are attacking persons of just Muslim faith (non-radicals and those that have not pledged to ISIS). I am seeing the discrimination and the potential areas of concern firsthand. 

I think that it is a terrible event that happened, and I know it's soon after the event but I'm afraid the media is running away with some of these stories and causing excessive trauma. I am concerned greatly of the impact that will face people that are-- I guess I will say different-- in the future. 

I also think that we need to evaluate at some point what happened to these two individuals to make them so radical and changed them both so drastically. There are mental health implications involved here, there are red flags that went unnoticed, there are areas for improvement and potential preventative care measures that can be implemented to stop this senseless violence and combat any future similar situations. I don't understand why we as professionals are not looking at this from a person-in-environment perspective and practice what we preach?"

3w9f1o,522,2015-12-10,An analysis of what went wrong with the recent update from a software developer and former games studio employee,Study_Smarter,GlobalOffensive,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3w9f1o/an_analysis_of_what_went_wrong_with_the_recent/,"Just to give a bit of background and clarification from the title:  I have two years of commercial software development experience.  15-months of that was at a games studio (a one-year internship that got extended).  This post is not to discuss the merits of the R8 or any of the other balance changes, but to discuss *why* the alleged imbalance now exists, and to ask the community for suggestions on how to ensure it doesn't happen again (within the context of how Valve works as a company).  I also do not work at Valve, and never have.
  
First Issue:  
Valve don't appear to hire dedicated QA testers (they have vacancies for everything except this on their careers page).  From the outside looking in, it appears they adopt the mentality of ""Developers can test their own work.""  Now, theoretically, this is possible, but in reality, it doesn't turn out well (which we, as Valve's users, have just experienced).  However, there are a lot of benefits to a dedicated QA team, because they:  
  
A. Find the use cases the developer didn't think about.  (i.e., holding right-click and tapping left-click to pre-charge your R8 shot).  
B. Hold the developers accountable for their work prior to launch.  
C. Maintain a rigorous QA process that ensures bugs don't get into the wild, existing functionality is not broken, and quality remains high.  
  
Valve, quite clearly, does not have a rigorous QA process.  If they did, this would have never happened.  
  
  
Second Issue:  
We appear to have the issue of design-by-committee.  Nobody is anybody else's boss at Valve.  Seriously.  Check out their employee handbook: [http://valvesoftware.com/jobs/](http://valvesoftware.com/jobs/)  
  
At the games studio I worked at, we had a lead game designer for each game, who was responsible for making design decisions (such as adding a new weapon, altering spray patterns, etc.).  This person always had decades of industry experience, and a great knowledge of both the games mechanics and its playerbase.  Sometimes the game designer was wrong, and that became apparent when our dedicated QA team (and often, the rest of the team) did play tests.  We'd reason with the game designer and have him/her present his/her case, but ultimately s/he had the final say.  The benefit of this was that it is hard to find something that pleases everybody, and often compromises just leave everyone with a lot of shit they didn't want in order to accommodate a little bit of what they did want.  This is bad.  It leads to lots of bad shit being made.  
  
Valve having no official management structure leads to design by committee.  Notice how certain elements of the R8 are actually a really good idea, but combined it just doesn't work.  This is a *classic* example of design-by-committee gone wrong.  Bob wants a longer time-till-fire in a weapon, Sally wants a new pistol, and Liz wants another one-hit-kill weapon.  Tada, they compromise with the R8.  If a lead game designer had the majority of the power, it would have never happened.  
  
So how can Valve, as a games studio, improve?  It's actually really difficult to say, because a lot of the stuff that resulted in this update is also, in other situations, beneficial.  However, I think somebody at the company needs to step up and say, ""My job is to create a rigorous QA process across all of our games.""  Of course, nobody would have to follow that person, because nobody is anybody's boss, but that person could get buy-in from everyone, and as long as they retained solo ownership of the QA process project, it'd avoid any design-by-committee shortcomings.  Valve could also nominate a lead game designer for each game.  That person doesn't necessarily have to be anyone's boss.  
  
Thanks for taking the time to read.  This post has two objectives, to be informative and to provoke constructive criticism from the community.  What do you all think?  What else do you think Valve could do to improve?  If we keep this constructive, we'll all benefit :-).  
  
Edit 1: Accidentally submitted my first draft whilst closing the ""big editor"" window.  Reworded some stuff and fixed some formatting.  
Edit 2: Formatting.  Rewording.  Removing redundancies.  
Edit 3: Reworded first sentence on Valve's QA hiring.  Added the words 'appear' and 'dedicated' for clarification.  
Edit 4: Fixed typo and spacing.  Really regretting the initial, accidental submission :-P.  
Edit 5: I just want to add, I do not work at Valve, and never have.  This analysis is like analyzing a train wreck to figure out why it crashed.  We can't be 100% sure on anything, but we can probably get a good idea as to what happened by putting the pieces together, and increase safety measures to prevent future wrecks.

3w9w7b,1,2015-12-10,Dorms - Inspiration or Obstacle? How about both.,amalia13,NinjaEssays,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaEssays/comments/3w9w7b/dorms_inspiration_or_obstacle_how_about_both/,"College Dorms: An Inspiration or an Obstacle for Students' Progress?
	When you can’t afford college, usually the decision for living off campus is out of the picture. From what I saw, all my friends who didn’t have the money, chose to live at home with their families. Sometimes I wish I had done this myself. I realize I probably would have saved a lot of money, wouldn’t have worked as much and would’ve been able to see my family more. Instead, not letting my financial situation affect my decision, I chose to go off to live in the dorms. Only a 15 minute drive from my house, I chose to live with this new sense of independence. I could go home (my dorm) whenever I wanted to, went out with whoever I wanted to and in general, started a new life of experience. I’m not sure what inspiration I was looking for but there sure were obstacles of learning what is really good for me. 	
	Inspiration. We all seek it. When I decided to live in the dorms, it wasn’t because I was seeking inspiration. In my mind, it was simply to gain experience about college life. But the thing about inspiration is that it usually comes unexpectedly. It happened for me with boys, with school, work, my career, internship ideas, goals, dreams, and with how I started to treat and eventually care for myself. I somehow found myself making all these connections in clubs, classes, and events and found someone to call my best friend. With everyone I spoke to, something in my own thoughts shifted. Every opinion I have ever had, I can tell you have all changed in some aspect. My mind was open to more, to new things and that is an inspiration in itself. To be able to let your guard down, hear what others have to say and really learn about how different yet similar the world can be. 
	We all have made similar mistakes living in dorms. Maybe getting too loud and someone calling the CA on you, having problems with your roommate, choosing to have sex (although this one doesn’t have to necessarily be considered a mistake) and many other little things. But when you are coming right out of high school, it seems a little unfair to be expected to automatically be adults. I’m not speaking for myself since I did grow up completing my own chores but there are many people out there who didn’t grow up washing their own clothes, cleaning up their room or even cooking dinner. Students who now have to learn to do all this when they move out go through a bit of a challenge. Not even that, it’s a learning process. It’s a small obstacle that once you overcome it, there is this sense of achievement in knowing you really are learning how to be on your own. You are growing up and I’ll just say, that is an inspiration for the high school students at your old school or any younger siblings who are probably following in your footsteps. 
	Being homesick. You’re lying if you say you were never homesick once you moved into the dorms. For at least a minute, there is that moment of wondering if you made the right decision. But if you’re like me, you snapped out of it within thirty seconds because you thought of how much fun you were about to have being free. But for some, being homesick can become a serious issue. I’ve seen it first-hand where a friend of mine freshman year would have panic attacks from how much she wanted to be back home. She was from out of state so every week she would try to plan a flight back home. She was surrounded by good friends and had a supportive roommate and together we helped her get through her first semester. At the end, she did go back home. But before going back, she made sure she had a plan. She questioned what she was really going to school for and did continue her education back home. It was something small but she knew her family was her inspiration and she did want to be near them more than anything. And it is perfectly okay to want to be near your family Out of state and living in dorms isn’t for everyone, but sometimes trying the experience is the only way you can find out for sure. 
	By this time, you’ve probably noticed how many random things I can bring up. But that’s the way my mind tends to think. With a million spiraling ideas. But I believe that is a lot of college students. I do believe that is how many of our minds are when we are first moving into our dorms. Are we going to like our roommate, can we really do this, can I handle this? There is a lot to put on your plate when we barely know how classes are going to be. But dorm life will always be an obstacle in one way or another. One we can learn from and eventually share our experiences about with others. As for inspiration, when we overcome our obstacles is when we will realize how much work we have done for ourselves without even seeing it.

3w9y4j,11,2015-12-10,27 year old civil engineering graduate with no real world experience looking to get his foot in the door,Grannie_Panties,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/3w9y4j/27_year_old_civil_engineering_graduate_with_no/,"Hello r/civilengineering

I graduated with a civil engineering degree from UCLA back in 2010. It's hard for me to admit, but I didn't have a very good GPA at all, and partied a little too much thinking, as long as I have a degree I will be able to find a job, but unfortunately that naivety has plagued me to this day. Currently I am working in an unfulfilling IT position and am desperate to get back to working as an engineer.

I try to apply to many positions and any interviews I do manage to get, usually get the same response, that I do not have any experience in the field. I unfortunately did not apply to any internships when in school because I didn't think I would need them, again a decision that has plagued me to this day.

So my question to you all is, what can I do to gain experience and prove that I am able to do the work if given the opportunity? What can I do to show employers that i am capable of doing the work, even though i have been out of school for 5 years now. Every job I have ever done, I haven't felt like its a good match for me, but I feel getting an engineering job is all that will fulfill me professionally and any advice anyone can give me would be extremely valuable.

Thank you for reading this."

I am really confused as to what to do and am in dire need of advice on whether or not to pursue PA school, and if so, how can I boost my chances of getting in?

Here is my background: 

I absolutely love caring for people in need.  During high school and my undergrad, I spent much of my time volunteering in hospitals and homeless shelter, being a medical research intern, and secretary of my pre-med honor society.  I decided towards the end of my undergrad that I wanted to become an elementary teacher instead since I felt I would build more rapport  with students and their families for years to come, making a bigger impact.  I went directly to graduate school and obtained my Master's degree in Curriculum and Instruction since I wanted to be a master educator.  During that time, I also went off to Peace Corps, only to leave early since I was engaged right before I left and felt I couldn't commit to the 27 months.  Upon returning home, I became a teacher for two and half years, and realized I wanted to amount to something much more.  I love being with my students, but I felt I would make greater impact in the lives of many in the medical profession.  As a teacher, I felt under valued, disrespected, and underpaid.  

At this time, I have opted to tutoring at a learning center and substitute teaching as I try to navigate as to what to do with my career.  I am also married now, 29, and my husband is thinking of starting a family in the near future...  

I feel that if I am to pursue becoming a PA, I would need to put starting my family life on hold another 3 to 4 years.  I still need to take 5 science classes to meet the pre-requisite requirements, take my GRE, and build upon my medical background (considering applying at the local hospital as a PCA, shadowing a PA, or volunteering in the hospital again) before applying.  I still have student loans to pay off so I am afraid the tuition and fees of PA school will be an extra heavy burden on our family.  

I feel that if I don't pursue PA now, I will never get a better chance to.  I don't want to live a life of regret in that I could have become a Physician Assistant.  I just don't know if it is the right time for my family.  My husband is also at a crossroads.  He feels that we are ready to start settling down and start a family.  He is already making a six figure income, and if I just stick to teaching, it should be more than enough for our future family.  

What are your thoughts?  

I am also afraid that I am not a successful candidate for PA school since I made  Bs in chemistry, and C in organic chemistry in my undergrad.  My Biology grades are A and A&amp;P I is an A-.  I have yet to take Immunology, Genetics, A&amp;P II, and Microbiology.  I am hoping that since I love biology so much and have done well in the past, that I would manage well in the other courses.  I am not too sure if I should take Organic Chemistry again since I made a C.  I really loathe O-Chem.  Thoughts?

My plan if I am to pursue PA school is the following:

I was thinking of taking Microbiology, A&amp;P II in the Spring, while working as a PCA at the local hospital on PRN (7pm-7am).  I am not too sure if it is a wise idea working while taking those classes, but I figured it would give me more patient care experience to make me a better candidate for PA school.  Then take Genetics and Immunology in the summer before applying by September 1st.  Thoughts?

Also what would you suggest: being a PCA, shadowing PAs, or volunteering at the hospital in the ER? Or, which of the two would increase my chances?

Thank you again in advance.  I wish I had decided on PA school beforehand as I was pursuing grad school, but life happens.  I just hope that in making the decision, I would be satisfied with it in the long term.  Thank you."

3wbfb3,25,2015-12-10,[M/F]Asking Mary to be my girlfriend,throwaway83495720934,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/3wbfb3/mfasking_mary_to_be_my_girlfriend/,"I first met Mary at a work conference during my internship. She's got the cute girl next door look down to a tee, sly and charismatic, jet black hair which she tied up at times to look more professional. Brown eyes that hinted at the mischief underneath. Her business clothes hid a athletic frame and a hinted at the set of perfect C cups that hid under her blazer. Her casual giggles let me know she liked me, and we flirted briefly at the conference, trying not to make our intentions too obvious to our other colleagues. Although I was able to get her number, she lived across the country, and the ritualistic dance, phone tag, and texting continued for months thereafter.

She was cautious at first but it was a drunken phone call on her birthday that finally revealed that she liked me. The harmless flirting became realistic plans, and soon I was on a plane to Texas to see her. I had planned to ask her out with an elaborate scheme of personalized note cards, and also teased about kissing her at the airport.

She was waiting for me at the bottom of the escalators when I arrived. The confidence I had over the phone evaporated and was replaced by a lump in my throat. She was no longer in the stuffy suit, and looked even more adorable. With a cute tank top that gave the slightest hint to her cleavage below and yoga tights that showed off her figure. Her bangs falling over her baby face. ""hi!"" we both said awkwardly as we hugged. I clumsily made an attempt to kiss her as we separated from the hug. She pushed me away with that trademark giggle.  ""you dared me!"" I said, trying to hide my clumsiness. I grabbed her hand and held it in a poor effort the salvage the awkward hello, and we walked to her car. 

We arrived to a pristinely made hotel room after a short drive, the queens size bed being center piece. We sat down on the bed and laughed at ourselves, two college kids meeting for only the second time in a strange hotel room. I broke a long silence by giving her the cards I made her and asking her to be my girl friend, and she said yes, letting out another giggle. it was only then that we kissed, laying face to face on the still made bed.

""Gosh I can't remember the last time I did this she said."" ""did what?"" I responded slyly, as I slipped my tongue into her mouth. She gave in and pressed her body into mine, our hands fumbling over each other, tugging on the other's clothes. I was admittedly getting carried away, my hands cupping her breasts, and then exploring lower, reaching under her panties and to my surprise, finding it soaked.  She jumped and grabbed my hand. ""stop, I have something to tell you, she said."" A thousand thoughts run through my head, I panicked, I must have moved too fast, I'm an idiot. ""well.. this is kind of embarrassing, but I am not exactly what you would call experienced"". silence. ""you are a virgin?"" I asked. She nodded shyly.

""would you like me to stop?"" ""no, I want it"" she said, that was my que and my hands slowly trace their way back down... I played with her panty lines, noting the feel of the lacy fabric.  going slower this time, tracing my fingers over her panties and feeling the warmth radiating off of her. I pulled the fabric aside and pushed my index fingers between her lips. Instantly my fingers were covered with her juices. I bit my lips, my cock now rock hard as I sink my fingers deeper into her, letting her warmth swallow the length of my finger. she let out a visible moan and clutched me tigher. I pushed my tongue into her gaping mouth, curling my fingers up and feeling her legs close tighter around my arm. ""is this okay?"" I asked, she nodded, her eyes closed, still clutching me. I sank a second finger into her, curling them up so I can press them against her g spot. ""fuck..."" She squirmed and whimpered in excitement. It was the first time that I've heard her curse.

I couldn't take it anymore, I got on my knees and pulled her tights off. Even her black lacy panties couldn't hide the wet spot she made. I hooked my arms under her knees and pulled her towards me, lowering my head between her thighs. I pushed my nose and lips into her wet panties and tasted her through the fabric. She instantly tightened her legs around me, her hips slowly gyrating into my face. I responded by forcing her legs apart and pulling her panties aside, my lips touched her naked pussy for the first time and I ran my tongue between her pussy lips..

I knew I wanted her, all of her. I pulled her panties off with one arm, as I repositioned myself on top of her. There was no words exchanged, she breathed heavily against my neck as I pushed my now throbbing cock against her clit, our juices oozed out in between, I tried my best to be gentle, watching as the head of my cock slowly disappeared into her. But as I pushed, I felt the tightest pussy pushing back. Mary's moans turned into screams, and I gave a final thrust as her lips gave way. Her hand dug into my back as my cock filled her up.

I gave only a few more thrusts before she had to stop from the pain. We laughed a bit and cleaned up the now mess of sheets around us. I made a few crude jokes about the blood and the cleaning lady before she playfully punched me. We got ready to go out for the night, but that wasn't the last time I had her before bed time. Happy to share more of our stories if you guys are interested.

My mom told me i looked intimidating so her interns dont bother to talk to me. 

I get really nervous before i do something important.. like my heart races and i cant think straight. Ive been sent to the ER because of this.

I am scared as hell to contact my former friends/ professors esp. Now that i need to ask them to be my character references. Ive also dodged a lot of employment opportunities because im afraid to be interviewed and be rejected. Also, whenever i imagine social interaction.. i just freeze and get scared..

I wanted to start a business but i worry constantly on how i will market the product to people to the extent that i will just shove those ideas off and wont work on it.
When i think of the future, thats when my anxiety goes overdrive because i feel stuck and worthless. I wasnt like this before, i was a cheerful, motivated and driven girl who had her goals waiting to be achieved. What triggered this was when i failed to meet my sales quota in college because i didnt sell the product enough to people because i was scared of rejection.

My mom dismisses my plea for help and it isnt helping me at all.

3wc0xw,11,2015-12-11,Grieving Your Old Life,tyleratx,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/3wc0xw/grieving_your_old_life/,"Last month was two years out of the church, which is crazy in and of itself. I officially left at age 24, now 26, and I've come a long way since I left.  At first I was scared, confused, not sure of who I was or why I left.

Now I am back in school (got accepted into University) and putting my life together.  I'm not nearly as emotionally down as I was back then, and I feel much more ""myself.""

I was a born again, tongue praying, charismatic christian from age 15 to 24, and I was obsessed.  I moved to Colorado Springs, CO to attend New Life Church as an intern (YES, the Ted Haggard church for anyone perceptive), and I spent HOURS a week there.  The church was known for its elaborate music, lights, sound and powerful preaching.  I was absorbed in it, and ended up being emotionally manipulated.  I transitioned from a boy to a man in that world.  It was where I first pursued goals, had my first sexual experiences (against rules, might I add), had my first serious heartbreak.  I was engaged to be married only for the church to recommend me to call off my wedding one month before.  I was such a believer that I accepted without question.

Eventually, I left, recognizing that the church was harming my life more than helping.  Now that I'm out, I can look back and process the whole experience with some distance and some sobermindedness.  And I'm grieving, in a way.  I'm not old, but I'm older, and I realize that I lost my late teenage years and early 20s in that world.  All the music, friends, relationships I had are pretty much gone.  The world is a much more quiet, if peaceful place for me now.  

And I feel a sense of pain.  I wonder how much of it is missing the religion, and how much of it is simply grieving my youth.  Leaving at age 24, I felt so much pressure to suddenly GROW UP.  Take responsibility for my life.  And I miss that old, idealized world.  Again, I'm trying to figure out how much of that is related to the religion, and how much of it is just getting older.   

Not sure what I hope to accomplish by sharing besides someone else hearing me vent.  Has anyone else gone through similar experiences?"

From my job, I met my ex as he was a construction worker. We’ve known each other for 8 months and had a relationship for about 3 of those months (ended last month), which did not work out but stayed friends. From my pov, I feel like we were only attracted to each other as we spent 10 hr+ days together, 7 days a week  (construction life) as well as being the only two people in our age group. 


It pretty much went down hill as soon as he got laid off because its now winter/off season where we live. Now, I knew that he has a very bad gambling addiction, smoked weed everyday, and did drugs occasionally, but it was curbed when we were dating/friends because we were both so busy with work. He did express that he wanted to change – eventually (without me pushing anything), and wanted my help/support. I never understood the full extent of it until he had free time, and gambled his entire last paycheck and bonus in one night. As well, he admitted that he was dealing drugs now that he didn’t have a stable source of income. 


Communication slowed down, and we agreed to be friends but I do feel like I’m putting in most of the effort in keeping the conversation going. I do genuinely care about his well-being as a friend, as well he doesn’t have a very supportive network because his family is heavily religious (and would greatly disprove of his habits) and his friends are living the same lifestyle. He avoids seeing me face –to-face, but has no problem with texts/calls. 


The lack of effort on his end makes me want to leave it behind me because I feel like my efforts are futile, but in the past he really did seem genuine about changing his habits, and I did promise back then to be supportive. I feel like if I can make a difference I should, but don’t know how to approach it without overstepping my boundaries as a friend. 

I feel that the fact that he acknowledges that he does have a problem and wants to change it is a good sign. But his worst problem is his lack of follow through – he knows what he wants but not how to get it/put the effort in getting it. A good example is that he wants to finish school, but puts it off constantly because he never has money.


My friends already see this guy as a dead-beat and bad news, and advise me to just stay away. Reddit what do you think? 




   
**tl;dr**: I feel like I am over any lingering feeling for my ex, but want to have a supportive role in his down-spiraling lifestyle. Don’t know if it’s pushing my boundaries as a friend, but can’t stand by and watch it happen. "

It's been a long ten days. So many things have happened. Jameson has been wearing underwear all week and only a diaper to go to bed. He has done so well with pooping and peeing in the potty. I really needed diapers when I put them on my list but I took them off because I really think he's doing well. We have enough for night time for over a month. This is great news. I am ready for this diaper thing to be done with. Haha. Anyone else who has ever potty trained a child when it wasn't easy can relate I'm sure. 

Jameson and I are doing crafts today. We made holiday masks. I tried to get him to sit still for a picture. HAHAHA No.. He's so excited and jumping. He wont sit still for pictures. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/oB9o5) This is the best I could get. lol

Anywho so far we are getting a super fun Christmas outfit. We would really appreciate it if we could get something else for under the tree that is a toy he can open up and play with or maybe some books we can read. He has a few stocking stuffers from a lady down the street. She brought some over for us the other day. It was the sweetest thing. I dont know what they are but they're small presents. It looks like a few matchbox cars and something else. That woman has a good heart. I met her this past year while taking Jameson for a walk. We had just had two of my back teeth pulled and I have zero ibuprofen or anything and I was in so much pain and just walking with the baby and he stopped to play with her grandchildren and she saw my mouth and saved my entire day. She really did. Jameson and I are going to paint something for her. I was thinking about giving her one of my pictures that I've painted. 

Jameson loves to play Othello and Connect Four with me. He hasn't quite gotten the concept just yet but we are still working on it. Chess will be right around the corner once he gets Othello! That's pretty exciting. He's a wicked smart kid. He's so excited for Santa to come. 

I never know what to say and I feel like I've rambled enough. If there's any more questions please feel free to ask. We need help because I am out of a job at the moment. I had a paid internship that fell through. I'm a full time student going for information technology. Plan on going to a 4 year at some point. School money wont kick in until January. Thank you so much!!

Merry Christmas

EDIT: Gifted toys, a book, pj's, christmas outfit. It looks like we have reached our five limit. This is excellent. Thank you so much. What I had wanted to get him was that track set. We found some of the bigger items at a tag sale this summer and he has gone crazy over the larger pieces. But we need some more of the smaller pieces so I wanted to get him that track set. I have it all set up in his room and we always need more tracks to lay out. BUT, he did need a book. I mean, i want to buy him ALL the books but I really think the track set would be best. It's something that he can play with regularly with me, by himself, or with other friends. We do have books and sometimes I get sick of reading the same ones but I think we can make do. He got this book called ""The Little Old Lady Who Wasn't Afraid Of Anything"" It's an excellent book. He would act out the actions in it. I loved it. I even brought it to his daycare and I would read to the kids and I had them involved in the actions too. Oh it was so fun. He got it in August. We read that book every single day I swear to you up until Halloween before I was like, okay... we have to find a new one. We have to. We just have to. lol. We haven't found a book like that one yet but he does enjoy pete the cat and some other random books we have. Anyway, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am grateful. I appreciate this. Thank you so much. &lt;3"
3we3k6,2,2015-12-11,"Me [21F] with my boyfriend [22 M] of 2 years, he got invited on a trip to Iceland and he might not go because of me.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3we3k6/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_22_m_of_2_years_he_got/,"My boyfriend is a very sweet, very very caring guy and is very attentive to my emotions, so when he realizes im upset, if he knows its something he did he'll immediately try and remedy, which I appreciate a lot. 


Ive always suffered from anxiety, since I was in kindergarten  basically and for the past 6-8 months Ive been dealing with depression. A lot of the feelings come from lack of self confidence and feeling like a very large part of who I am is missing and theres nothing I can do about it right now, or for a while probably, and also a fear of whats ahead in my life and if im doing things right or not.


That huge part of me thats missing is the area I live in. Ive grown up in the same state my whole life, same big city, and then went to college in a small college town. My passion in life is traveling and exploring and seeing what the world has to offer besides city life. I feel so empty without being able to go see the world, or even the other side of the U.S. for that matter. Its always been my (small) dream to go camping in Colorado or Oregon for a week or two, and my ultimate goal is to go see New Zealand, Greenland, Iceland and hike and live off the land as much as possible, become part of the culture there, get to know new people and their stories and traditions, but my family has never been wealthy enough to travel more than a few states away. 


A few weeks ago my boyfriend got invited on a trip to Iceland with his friends from home. He was planning on going but once knew how I seemed to feel about it immediately said never mind. The reasons I was so upset about him going was because he never asked my opinion on it (not permission, opinion), he agreed to going knowing the trip would cost between $1200 and $1800 (he only has $1800 in his bank account) and didnt think about the consequences of that. He works minimal hours a week and can only save $10-$15 max every two week pay period, and the trip is in the beginning of summer.


I was a bit hurt by the fact that he was going to spend his entire savings on a trip, which would lead to him having to move 10 hours away next year in order to live with his parents if he could not find a job that paid well enough for a single person apartment in our college town area, and being a first year college grad with no internship experience (and a job that requires 6 months-1 year of lab experience), that isn't very likely. We already had a friend vacation planned with our friend group from school that he wouldn't be able to afford if he paid for the Iceland trip, and the worst part of it all is that I'm jealous that he gets the opportunity to live my dream without me. The jealousy creates resentment because while I'm dealing with depression for this situation, he'll be out doing what would make me ultimately happy. 


I feel like that is so selfish of me and I genuinely want to be happy for him and this opportunity he has, but its going to possibly cause our relationship to be long distance for a year or so, along with not being able to go on vacation with me and our friends anymore. I want to be supportive and excited for him but my jealousy of him living out something that is causing me to be depressed, and putting himself in a position to be long distance with me for a year or so, along with canceling on our friend vacation just really upsets me and irks me in a place that I cant shake.


Before you tell me to go to therapy and all that, I have been for years. I have good spurts and bad spurts and ive been stuck in a very large funk for the last 8 months. My boyfriend has been nothing but supportive and comforting towards me but I feel like im being selfish or taking advantage of how supportive he is with this one, but another part of me feels like he is being selfish in this situation given the circumstances. I dont know what to do.

TLDR; boyfriend might go to Iceland which is part of my depression, and him going may cause us to be long distance for a year or so, along with canceling our friend vacation. I want to be supportive of him like he is of me but I dont know how to handle this situation.

I was laid off from my job a month ago. My old job caused me a kind of numbing dread, since I felt kind of trapped there for almost a decade and felt like I wasn't very good at it and nobody liked me. So when I got fired I actually thought ""maybe this is the best thing that could happen to me.""

But it hasn't been. I have just been a mess. I can't sleep, I have no appetite, and I am at this new internship that is more career oriented for me and anyone else would be thankful and excited to do it, but I am just like, terrified of the place. The day before I have to go into the internship I am just like trembling with anxiety...the entire day. All the other interns seem so upbeat and positive and relaxed and I feel constantly overwhelmed. I know it isn't likely I'd get a job there because I feel really held back by my stress and anxiety. The manager there is also kind of an intense, mean guy and I feel extremely nervous around him. And since taking on the internship, I've felt even more anxiety about the fact that I'm in my 30s and still don't know what I could do for a living...Almost every single person I know seems happy and confident in their careers, but I am still completely lost.

Anyone else dealing with this sort of thing? I don't see a therapist (no money) and I don't take any medication (bad luck with it in the past), except Xanax, which I can only use to go to sleep because it knocks me out. I can't use it during the day. So I'm really on my own here. "
3wepzb,152,2015-12-11,"IAmA founder of a 2 year, college replacement for future founders and developers with no up front tuition in San Francisco, AMA!",JRManifold,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wepzb/iama_founder_of_a_2_year_college_replacement_for/,"I left MIT to start [Make School](http://www.makeschool.com). I'm the guy in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rT00QXqZak). Thanks to Reddit it was actually in the top 10 most viewed videos in the US the day it was released and generated many AMA requests!

Some background: In 2009/2010 my co-founder and I taught ourselves mobile development and launched iPhone Apps. We quickly realized that learning how to build and launch products was teaching us more relevant skills in a better way than our college CS curriculum. There was a huge missed opportunity in CS education to teach students industry-relevant skills, with a project-based curriculum, and without putting students into debt. Over the years, our dissatisfaction with college grew.

We left school to start our own in 2012 with funding from [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) and later from Alexis Ohanian and others. We run intensive summer programs teaching app development and as our programs and teaching style grew in popularity we launched our 2 year program this year. We created it to provide students with the college education we wish we had had.

We built the curriculum by talking to Silicon Valley companies to make sure we were teaching the technologies and skills that will best prepare our students for a career in tech. There's no up-front tuition cost - instead you pay us back through internship earnings and 25% of your first two years' salary, aligning our incentives with students and doing our part to fight the college debt crisis.

3wf04h,3,2015-12-11,"Me (27 F) with my friend (28 F) and her mother (60-ish F). I'm almost fed up with their codependent relationship, and now the mother is texting me about financial issues. More background info inside...",theyseekherthere,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wf04h/me_27_f_with_my_friend_28_f_and_her_mother_60ish/,"My friend (hereby referred to as Tracy), lives a very...unconventional life for a late twentysomething.  We went to undergrad together - both pursuing degrees in the Psychology field.  I went on to more schooling and a career.  Tracy went on to grad school, had an interview for a paid internship program for job placement...and then quit her field of study all together.  Why is this?  When she went for the interview, the interviewer asked her uncomfortable questions about her failures in life, why she thought she could get into this program, etc.  While the interviewer might not have needed to be so forward, I feel like Tracy overreacted to this ""failure"".  I love the girl, but she tends to blame outward factors for her struggles instead of encountering them personally.  This will be an ongoing theme in the story I'm about to lay out.


Upon her leaving this field of study two years ago, she decided to go back to school because she has ""always had dreams of going into the medical field"".  Her mother (who she still lives with) backed her up.  This lead her to doing two years back at our old college for prep courses and now transferring to another for a pre-Physicians Assistant program.  Throughout these three years, other friends and I have been supportive of her pursuits.  She worked part time while taking these classes and would often talk about how she ""wished she had taken this path five years ago"" and other similar statements of regret.  


As this semester is winding down for her, she tells me that she might not be able to return to her program because she doesn't have enough money to pay off the tuition for that part of the year.  Because of the status of the program she is in, students do not receive as much financial aid as they would in undergrad or P.A. School itself.  I tried to brainstorm any way possible that she could get the money to continue.  Right now, she is doing incredibly well in her classes and she insists that if she ""leaves after this semester, she knows she'll never come back.""


Tracy came to terms that she would have to take out a small private loan to fund the rest of her semester.  Unfortunately, none of her family/family friends have good enough credit or are willing to cosign the loan.  I tell her that I wish I could help, but my husband and I are closing on a house next Tuesday and all of my credit/funds are tied up in this venture.  She understands as she has seen my husband and I go through the process of getting the home.  


A few days ago, I receive two text messages from her mother.  Her mother has texted me before (two years ago) in regards to a birthday surprise for Tracy.  Otherwise, we never talk - save from when she drops Tracy off somewhere because Tracy doesn't have a license.  This was the content of those messages:



**TM (Tracy's mom):** Theyseekherthere, it's TM, Tracy's mom.  Hope this evening finds you and (husband) well.  Tracy doesn't know I'm sending you this message.  I reached out to her father and told him I needed help on behalf of Tracy.  To be the cosigner of the loan.  He didn't say no.  Just that he had to think and talk with his wife.  Some progress.  I hope that it will happen.  Please pray that it does.  I know Tracy needs a miracle.  I haven't told her yet.  Thank you.  I wish you and (husband) well.

**Theyseekherthere:** No problem.  I have been talking to her a lot about this.  I really wish we could help but my hands are tied since we close on our new house next week.  I have told her if she needs anything else she can always ask.

**TM:** Yes, I understand and I know you would help.  It's important to start your life.  May a bolt of lightning strike Tracy's father in a good way.  Ha!



A little background on the father statements.  Tracy's father has only been back in her life after five or so years.  He walked out on his family (TM, son, Tracy) when Tracy was a toddler.  Their relationship is still being felt out.  


As for why I addressed the house issue, her mother has been known to try and manipulate help out of people as well as showing a habit of pathological lying.  Sure enough, she texted me yesterday to tell me that Tracy's dad declined to cosign the loan and that she hopes he reconsiders. I can usually see these people coming a mile away, and I do my hardest to stay away from them.  **Even if I hadn't been closing on a house, I would NOT have cosigned a loan for my friend.  As much as I love her, she has no immediate career prospects and I do not know what would end up happening to the standing of the loan.**  


In addition to my above reasoning, I do not wish to give Tracy's mother an ""inch"" as it were.  Tracy has expressed to me how much she wishes she could leave her house because of how overbearing her mother is.  I have told her many times that I would help find her an apartment.  She is convinced she could not work to save enough money to pay her rent.  I tell her that's not true.  I have tried to help her obtain a driving license, but she has this in her head as another ""obstacle"".  


Tracy's desire to leave home has reached a fevered pitch since her brother returned home to live.  Her brother had a bipolar episode some months ago and is now seeking treatment.  He was kicked out of his home by a girlfriend, lost his job, and moved in with Tracy and her mother.  Five months later, he got another job, quit, has been skipping treatment appointments, and creates problems in their home.  Tracy wishes her mother would kick the brother out, but her mother will not.  She set a ""loose"" date of late October, but that came and went.  


Right now, Tracy claims that her mother venting to her about what's going on at home (right now, Tracy lives in temporary graduate student housing) is causing her to lose focus on school.  


I have had endless conversations trying to help my friend understand that she needs to take control of her life, stand up to her mother, and grow up as it were.  I fear that the older she gets, the worse the codependency becomes.  


Reddit, I came here to find *anyone* that has been in/might be in a situation much like mine.  Did your friend end up making it out of their dysfunctional home, or are they still stuck in a phase of stunted growth?



**tl;dr**: I'm almost positive my friend and her mother are codependent.  Mother is now ""hinting"" to me that I should cosign a loan for friend, but I have no intentions to do so.  Friend wants out of house with mother, but thinks she is incapable.  Anyone else have a friend like this?  How did it end up?"
3wf4zr,5,2015-12-11,"Me [21F] with my friend [23M] of four years, things have got awkward between us and he won't tell me what's going on",LostFriendThrowA,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wf4zr/me_21f_with_my_friend_23m_of_four_years_things/,"Hi guys,

I’m looking for a stranger perspective on the whole thing, I hope you’ll be able to help me. 

**4 years ago:** I met my friend, let’s call him John. We were college freshmen, I didn’t know anyone, and I just happened to start hanging out with John, whom I met on the first day, and two other people, a girl and a guy. The three of them were very opinionated while I just didn’t really care/share their ideas. It put me under a lot of pressure, so I drifted apart from their “group” after a while. I was still casual friends with John and the girl. Now, let me detail my friend’s personality a bit. He’s two year older than the rest of us, very cultivated. Reading War and Peace in his free time, always discussing politics, sometimes coming across as being better than us and saying pretty nasty stuff, but saying it’s all an act. You never really know when he’s serious. Overall someone you can’t really figure out. John was in a toxic long term relationship but I wasn’t close enough to him to be able to help him on a personal level. 

**2 years 1/2 ago**: he cut ties with our girl friend when he thought she had made a move on him. The whole thing was really messy. I don’t know if our friend actually loved him but she cared for him and John went no contact without telling her why. He stopped talking to her, texting her all of a sudden. She was really hurt not to get an explanation. She never really got over it because of how close the three of them were, it basically broke their small group. It was a very difficult time, the three of us were in the same class. It was awful, I was stuck in between the two of them, trying not to hurt anyone, but things eventually settled. They never talked again, except formally for class exercises.

**1 year and half ago**: John’s gf broke up with him. He was an utter mess. I reached out for him, telling him we could meet anytime if he needed to talk. To my huge surprise, he said yes. We never were “that” close, but I thought why the hell not and brought my bf along. We then became a lot closer, we would have drinks together, talk about politics, philosophy, whatever, or even personal things. It felt good to be able to have that kind of talks with someone, I never really could before. 

**1 year ago**: My bf threw a party on my b-day, John was here as well as another friend of mine, Emma, and my bf’s best friend, James. Everyone really hit off, it was fun, and we eventually became a group. Emma started going out with my bf’s best friend and we would all hang out at John’s place and chill. John became good friends with James, they had the same kind of humor and had the same vision on politics.

Then, a girl, let’s call her Jane, appeared out of nowhere. John had noticed her in class and had a liking for her, we would spend time with her during our lunch breaks but I didn’t know her much, I wasn’t in her class. John was weird with her, being unnecessarily mean but on a joking tone. He was sometimes horribly gross even but as I said before, you never really know when he’s joking, we thought that was part of his persona, and she didn’t seem to mind at all, she kept texting him, etc. One day, they all went out for drinks (I wasn’t there, can’t remember why) and Jane behaved horrifically while being drunk. Everyone was mad at her and John later told me she had shown her true self, that she was toxic like his ex-gf and that he would now stay away for her. A couple of weeks later, they got together. When I tried to ask him why he had do that after what he had told me, he looked at me blankly and said he had never said that. I didn’t get, I thought their dynamic was weird as hell, but I didn’t know her personally and they seemed happy somehow, so I dropped the subject.

**8 months ago:** things started going downhill with Emma for petty reasons. Basically she got upset at John and I for being “know-it-alls” while she was struggling to get the same grades as we did. John got upset at her for upsetting me (she is very blunt and aggressive, I’m pretty much on the opposite of the spectrum) and also because he felt like she wasn’t a good person for James. He thought that because of her he couldn’t see James as much as he’d liked and that her “moods” were making James miserable. Emma and Jane left the country because they had an internship opportunity and it was just the four of us, my bf, John, James and I. Sometimes I would meet John by myself and he was still mad at Emma, planning a way to make her break up with James. I told him several times it was none of his business, that all we could do was be here for James if he needed to but he wouldn’t hear it. He also wanted me to cut contact with Emma but she and I eventually had a grownup discussion and settled the matter. Apart from that we met a lot over the summer, more than the 3 years we had known each other. Things were great, he told me our friendship mattered a lot to him, that he had very few friends but he valued loyalty above all, etc. I relaxed for the first time because I feel the same away about friendship and was glad I had found a “true” friend.

**4 months ago**: Then it was time to go back to college. To my horror, I felt like the story was repeating itself: I was stuck between John and Emma. John stopped sitting next to me during classes because I was with Emma, etc, and we spoke very rarely. When we did he was rude, petty, and when I called him out on it he said “Why are you upset, can’t you see it’s my persona”. I felt bad, he was so nice and open-minded the whole summer, why was he behaving in such a hurtful way? He had grown to hating our studies, I also thought things weren’t going well with Jane, so asked him several time if anything was wrong, if it was because of me hanging out with Emma, he told me everything was okay. I wasn’t buying it but I felt like I had done my part. He then went no contact. I was so horribly upset, I felt so dumb, that if he had behaved like that once he’d do it again. We met several days later, he explained himself (he was mad but not really because I didn’t go to one of his parties because I was feeling ill like what the fuck). And I thought, okay, let’s just patch things up. Except, you guess, things never got better. We almost never see each other (he skips a lot of classes), we barely talk (when we do text he sends me jokes/nonsense). 

**A month ago** we met at a bar and he told me that he didn’t understand why I’m thinking he’s not feeling okay, that he did get annoyed at me for being “overprotective”, aka me asking him if he was alright. We had an explanation and he did seem relieved when we left, like had got something off his chest and said we had to do something soon with Jane. Except we didn’t, texts are non-existent except for the weekly random jokes but he has recently said he wanted us to meet (just that, no other context). I couldn’t - he has a habit of asking only a couple of hours beforehand -  so I said no to several of his texts but he never replies or tries to get things further. I never ask him because it’s just so awkward now, I don’t want to be “overprotective” and annoying basically. And to be honest I don’t know what I could tell him if we were to meet, I’m feeling so awkward now. My bf did try to message him (they stopped sending each other texts too), but he got the same answer and John even said “was it LostFriendThrowA that told you to send me that text?” (for info, it wasn’t me, my bf told me that after it happened).

I’m sorry this is getting long, but as you see there’s a lot going on and I really don’t get it. Emma tells me to just quit worrying about his ass, that he doesn’t deserve it. She said that he's using me for when he's feeling lonely, that if Jane dumps him he will come back to me. I don't know what to think anymore, I've never wanted any of this mess, I feel like we're middle schoolers enjoying creating drama, but at the same time I don’t want to lose my friend. I don’t know what’s going on inside his head because he won’t tell me, he won’t answer my questions either. I tried so hard to be open-minded, I thought we were big enough to behave like adults and tell each other what is wrong. Should I really accept that we are not really friends anymore? How can I reach out to him? I’m stuck. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I can provide more details if needed, I tried to keep things as short as possible.

**Tl;dr**: my friend of four years recently got really cold towards me and I don’t understand why, he won’t tell me and pretty much just stopped talking me. Not sure if it’s because of recent events, because he might feel depressed, because I'm no use to him right now or if I'm just being paranoid. I don’t know if I should call it quits.

3wfh1q,15,2015-12-11,1 year sober and feel like I haven't made any progress.,root_unix,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3wfh1q/1_year_sober_and_feel_like_i_havent_made_any/,"Hello leaves. This is my first post here although i have been reading this sub for a long time. I am a recovering weed addict and I quit a while as I realized I wasn't utilizing it in a responsible manner. I have felt pretty solid ever since but lately I haven't felt so solid. I am at the crossroads in my life and so I decided to post my story here to maybe get another point of view that can help me find some clarity.

After high school in 2010 I decided to get into computer science. I had already been smoking for about a year and a half although the structure of high school kept me in place and produced some really good marks when I graduated.

2011:
First year at university I was studying Bachelors in Engineering of Information Technology. It was a new course the school was trying out and had a handful of modules such as accounting and philosophy. I had to try handle 10 modules each semester and so I flunked out at the end of that year only passing 5 modules. I had classes 12 hours a day and smoked at the end of each to try and relax. I was really angry about school at this point. How crazy it was. .

2012:
Being kicked out of school I decided to start a company where students could trade items easily online without having to post ads on notice boards which could make the ads fly away and you couldn't manage how many people are viewing your ads. I worked on the site all year and tried to get funding although as the year came to an end I was skeptical of actually making any money from this idea. 

I was smoking all day every day with a hometown friend who was improving his high school marks. My thinking was that I didn't have enough drive to work on my site unless I got high so every morning when my mother and sister left for work and I'd go see my friend and he'd bunk school and use his pocket money to buy weed and smoke with me. When my family was sleeping I'd go out and smoke weed then come back to work on the site.

 I registered the company and launched the site end of the year but it was really sloppy as I wasn't that experienced. So I decided to just listen to my mom and try to go back to school.

2013:
I was enrolled in a new university and was getting very great marks. I looked for weed and found it easily and so began spending most of time trying to get weed or smoking it. I got a lot of video games and just smoked and played them all the time. I was getting good marks eve without studying and so got very comfortable. I even met other stoner gamers and we'd smoke and play games together or watch tv shows like breaking bad. 

As the year progressed my marks started to drop. I was skipping classes to smoke. Smoking before important tests and never putting much effort to study even though I loved programming. At the end of the year I was kicked out of campus residence and had to find a room outside of school in a very dodgy area.

2014:
I was living with a friend from campus residence who was also kicked out and we were smoking a lot together. We saved up for bongs and lots of weed and it was really getting out of hand. We would come back from school just to take a bong hit then walk back to school. It was about 10 minute walk up and down a hill.  I was on a mission to build a good gaming pc so I could play better games and so I was broke most of the time. 

I was walking home one day and smelled weed on the street where lived. Not even thinking clearly I just asked those guys to smoke and made friends with them. They weren't attending school or anything just sitting in the same corner everyday smoking. I just greeted them as I went to class but I was really embarrassed they I had made friends with such people. 

One day I went with them to buy weed and the police drove up the corner we were smoking at. I was the only one with weed as I was buying for me and my friend who I lived with. I told the cops I'm just a student and I have a bit of money but this were good cops. I was alone in the squad car as they questioned me. Fortunately they didn't cuff me and so it wasn't a horrible but people understood was going on and I felt embarrassed. They measured my weed at a clinic and took me into the cells. This is making me uneasy just to write about it. This happened on a Thursday. 

I walked into the cell and it smelled like piss and immediately people were calling me to come sit with them. We talked about how we all got in and I bought pack of cigarettes and made friends with heroin addicts. 

I thought I would get out the next day and raised my voice at the judge about how I am just a student and made a mistake. She said ""well you should have thought about that before"". And I kept quiet. I didn't have money on me as one guy conned me in the prison saying we should shove it up our ass. I stupidly believed him as my heroin friends were long gone (but I would later meet them in prison) so I couldn't afford bail. He took all the money I had and my sim card that I could have used to make calls on the inside. Turns out I would never see him again as he was sentenced to prison and I was just going to be in jail waiting to go to court. 

I met up with the heroin guys I met before and the 6 days I was in jail we talked and they helped me out, protected me. We smoked cigarettes and weed every night to sleep easier. The place was infested with bugs and they kept biting while you sleep. I got really depressed in there thinking about what I have become. Just a few years ago it was just clean teenage fun, getting high and listening to music. Now I am sleeping next to people have really done bad things in their life. 

Tuesday I was quiet in court looking down not really listening. I only heard ""you will be released on a warning"" I looked up and thought maybe I still have a chance at redeeming myself. I got out and went to where I was staying. My friend was excited to see me. I threw my clothes away and took a shower. Then went out to see the world again. I bought potato chips at a store and gave the change to a kid and walked around campus looking at ladies, birds, trees and breathing fresh air. 

My friend bought a big bag of weed to celebrate. I felt uneasy but I wasn't man enough to say anything. We smoked and I fell back to my old patterns. This is when money started to get tight. I bought a new phone (heroin friends took my old one before I left, but I ended up saying they should as a way for me to say thank you). And then went to the therapy session the judge sent me to. I found out it cost a bit of money and I couldn't afford it. I skipped practicals to go there and only payed half the price. The judge dropped the charges and I was a free man for good. No criminal record in the books.

I talked to all my lecturers for all the tests I missed and I wrote all of them. Passing all but one. My friend moved out and I was staying alone in the house. So I wanted to buy from the guys who were there when I was arrested. They walked with me to the place and when it was time to smoke I told them I'm not smoking with them because it turned sour the last time. They got mad and started making my life miserable. They robbed me off my new phone and broke into my room when I was out writing a test (which I felt good about and passed). I told my mom and went home that weekend. And came back with my sister's expensive laptop. They assaulted me in public while I was out trying to get groceries and so I started being afraid of going out during the day. I only went out late and night to buy weed. 

I was really depressed at this point just staying in and smoking. I tried looking for a new place but all of them were expensive. Beautiful ladies moved in and I was the only guy so I didn't look for a new place anymore. I never went to class and ended up failing all my modules. I didn't study enough because I felt confident during the semester. (My marks were okay, I only did bad during exams). 

During my birthday I went out clubbing. Turns out my new roommate made a deal with those guys to get me out the house so they could rob me of everything I own. That night they took my clothes, sister's computer, lcd screen, modem, keyboard, mouse, two phones and my microwave plus a couple of textbooks. My mom fetched me the next day and was pissed. Even worse the school kicked me out. And she would soon find out. She doesn't know I spent time in jail, not a 23:08:16 of people do. I will probably die with that secret.  

This is when I realized that my habits have lead me in the wrong direction. My smoking habit made me meet bad people, do bad things and have good things taken away. I quit on that day I got the message from the school. It was on the 3rd of December 2014. I was depressed and having withdrawals from weed thinking about what I can do to get back. I wrote an appeal stating what had happened and how I planned on changing. It was denied. I told my mother I want to go to therapy and do a few courses to show that I am still able to pass.

2015:
I did the therapy while staying clean. Then my mom said she will not fund the courses I wanted to do even though I showed her the emails I had with the Dean and Course coordinator how it would highly improve my chances at readmission. She still denied and told me to find a job. I applied for hundreds of jobs and haven't gotten a reply from a single one. I had no skills to show for myself just a high school diploma. I live in a country with 25% unemployment with the bulk of that being young adults (about 80%). Some even struggle to find a job even with a degree. So I was discouraged and stayed home cleaning the house and reading stuff on the internet. 

I only gave out 1hr computer literacy lessons to the professor who was my therapist. It rekindled my love for operating systems as I was cleaning and fixing up my old computer putting on an Arch Linux and making it look the way I want to. I started making comics and have gotten much better. And doing personal programming projects and posting them on github. I also kept a journal and upgrade my pc with the little money I made. I really took time to rebuild my whole sense of self. I was reading a lot and listening to different style of music. 

 My sister found me a job that made me develop a platform to manage ads on a free wifi network. It is my most ambitious project to date even though I was never payed for it. It was really good, lean and clean code that functioned wonderful (much better than the site I tried to make in 2012). I was doing this job and it was overlapping with university applications. I was going to apply telling the school that I went to therapy, had an unpaid internship, gave out computer literacy lessons and helped a high school kid pass mathematics. 

My mother planned on me getting a job so she could disown me and I didn't mind as I am well aware that I messed up my chances twice. She conjured a scheme to make me not apply for school and keep working on the free wifi ad system. I wanted to go back to school but she insisted on me doing the job. And so I felt really sorry for her. All the money I wasted. I could have been independent by now so she could enjoy  her old age life spending her money on things she wanted to do in her house.

 I didn't apply and the deadlines passed but later found out that, the job wouldn't pay me at all.  I got my drivers license and felt good except I didn't own a car.  I took a vacation with my mom for a week and spend time by the sea. Then applied for #borntocode when I came back from the vacation. It was going to be free tuition but you had to pass some tests. I got really far on the test judging from people who were tweeting how they were struggling and unfortanetly didn't make it. I got really sad as I thought that was my last chance to prove that I can do something. 

I don't have much to show for myself this year and I spend a year just sitting on the computer, my mom yelling at me for menial things, getting accused for smoking even though I am now 1year and 8days sober. I felt bad and made me feel like being clean for so long meant nothing. Like I am not making an effort to be a better person.  I didn't mind her yelling though as I was dirt poor and unemployed. My mother payed for rent and food so I had no right to talk back.  I felt bad being dirt poor and watching her and my sister buy an expensive fridge and redoing the kitchen and getting a new dishwasher and buying really expensive designer bags yet I can't even afford a USB to store things. I kept thinking this was the money that was supposed to be for school.

I got really depressed and came up with an idea to do computer so I can earn a bit of money the coming year. I sat around reading posts of people who have done it before. Taking notes and making plans on doing it. I had planned to make enough money to get an A+ certification in computer repair. It would show that I am very much still interested in computers. 

 A few days ago my mom told me to study something else. I told I still want to do computer science. And thought no matter what degree I was doing things would have been the same. We talked for 2 minutes before her phone rang and I stood listening to her talk with her friend for about half an hour. I felt pretty bad that she would rather catch up on gossip than talk to her own son. 

 She told me I shouldn't use my computer anymore and I was really angry because it is the only thing that has kept me sane. I didn't argue with her I just obeyed her and decided I should start the  computer repair business while waiting for next year August to apply for school again. This would keep me busy enough to not care that I am not on my computer and will help me make extra money for myself. 

I posted fliers around and got a few clients and fixed their computers, made some money. Today she told me I shouldn't fix people's anymore and if she finds out about it I should find another place to stay. I don't know if I am okay with this one as I am trying really hard to better myself and my life yet she keeps shutting down all of my plans. I feel like I'm pushing a boulder up the hill and she keeps pushing it down. I'm so exhausted. And I don't know what I'm going to do. 

Sometimes I wish I could smoke one just to relax but I cannot forego so much progress. Sometimes I wish I had enough money to move out but seems like I won't be allowed to make any. Sometimes I think about ending my life but I don't think it is worth it, I still have a long way to go. I am losing hope everyday that I will ever push that boulder to the top of the hill.

Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

I'm only 5'7 and about 150 pounds, my legs are on the shorter side (and a bit muscular) so I don't think chelsea boots would look nice on me. So I'm looking for something to boost the height a little, which is something I think the white sole isn't going to help with.

What do you guys think? Can you give me a recommendation for something less than $100?

3whgae,0,2015-12-12,Insider look at how the Imperial Cutter was designed,LazerChops,EliteDangerous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3whgae/insider_look_at_how_the_imperial_cutter_was/,"Earlier this year Frontier Developments took on a new intern, Dick. Dick was amazed at all the shiny technology in those Cambridge offices. On his first day, Dick looked over the shoulder of a senior developer who was busy adjusting and tweaking a ship using an amazing modelling tool. ""Wow!"", exclaimed Dick, ""That sure looks like fun"" as he watched the developer twist and shape the ship into its final form. ""Here, have a go"", said the senior developer. ""Let me pull up a template for you. Take the Imperial Clipper as a starting point. I'm off to get a pizza.""

Dick sat down at the computer and stretched and elongated the body of the Imperial Clipper until it became wider and bigger. ""Hmm...I wonder what would happen if I dialled in some crazy numbers into those flight model settings?"" Dick found the setting for ""agility"", and entered a 1. He played around for a bit and entered minus 2 for ""pitch"", and 1000 for ""drift"". After a short while Dick found that inputting extreme numbers into the flight model settings produced a fun, but unflyable, monster of a ship. Dick chuckled as he tested the new ship as it drifted across the screen, uncontrollable, attempting unsuccessfully to pitch its nose up. Dick was having so much fun with his comedy ship model that he wanted to show it to the senior developer when he came back from lunch. Dick pressed the ""Save"" button and gave it a new file name - ""Imperial Cutter"" - inspired by the pizza cutter that the senior developer was using on his lunch.

Sadly, Dick didn't return for his second day at Frontier Developments' offices due to an alternative job offer. However, the file remained on the senior developer's computer..."

She's a single mother, going through a lot to help us get through life. I appreciate that. But she has no boundaries? Like

When I was in school, I almost made a boyfriend and she found out and went absolutely ape shit on me, grounded me and basically wrecked me for the entire year. Which was fine back then, you know. I was young and stupid and he was a shit guy.

But she's fucked my privacy since then. I gradually just learned to deal with it, and started telling her everything about my life because it was easier that way, she would not be suspicious and I would be left to live in peace. I stopped doing things I could mention infront of mumma, I was basically Golden Child for the first year of college. I got good grades (top 10), did internships, came home on time, had good friends, did good society stuff, everything.

Second year mai I started taking on too much and started burning out. Still no boy, but this whole ""tell mumma every detail and listen to every whim of hers"" was getting old. It was getting to the point that thinking of disobeying her would give me actual, physical anxiety. She would behave like a child with me- take my clothes and not return them, talk about her boyfriend troubles with me, check out guys with me. It was nice, but only because I had literally no one else to share my life with. She started turning into my whole world, like every decision I make and every breath i take revolves around her and if she doesnt want me to, I wont do it. My friends stopped inviting me to events and stopped doing stuff with me because I simply couldnt- if mummy wanted me in the metro and home by 4 means I had to be home by 4. Not doing that gave me so much anxiety because when she gets angry she says and does the most terrible stuff. I can even sleep in my own room because of this- i was told go sleep in my brother's room as he was getting lonely these days and I couldnt refuse. I feel like her doormat.

Two months ago, I met a guy. And. Just. I had avoided all sorts of relationships till then, but he's different. Theres a future there when I think of him. Problem is that he's leaving to study in the UK in May and I'll be here without him for a year (or even longer if I dont clear UK myself)

So when I realised I was really attached to this guy, mummy could see it too (in my behaviour) so she asked me about it and I told her. She told me that she supports this, but to hold off the loving feelings and just stay friends. Too late, I'm pretty sure I'm falling in love with him, and vice versa. No big deal, he and I both agreed to go slow and wait for each other till we have a solid base career to start stuff from.

So now he and I are texting each other all the time, and we've kissed (nothing more) and we send a lot of lovey texts which I cannot let mumma see or else I'm fucked. But mother has problems with me texting people as well. SO yesterday (my exams are over now, I have nothing to do) I was in bed and texting him, and mumma came inside and got angry and took my phone. She may or maynot have read texts. I dont know, because today she wasnt showing any signs of reacting or being angry with me.

Either way, my fear is that she will somehow sabotage this and make me stop talking to him. I gave decent exams, hopefully 80+, definitely 70+ out of 100 in each paper this semester, but she might use my grades as an excuse to get me to stop talking to him which I dont want to do.

She knows the kind of hold she has on me, and if she yells at me and threatens me to stop talking to him, I'm afraid I'll be cowed into doing it. I want to stand up to her and tell her not to interfere in my relationships. How do I tell her this? How do I break free from her influence on me? I dont want to be scared anymore and I just want to give this guy a fair chance. If mummy tells me to cut contact, every time I meet him secretly, I'll be guilty and I know gradually this gult will overshadow my feelings for him. And I cant take that."
3wj2bl,54,2015-12-12,TIDTRT by giving a person a chance,tyr--,TIDTRT,https://www.reddit.com/r/TIDTRT/comments/3wj2bl/tidtrt_by_giving_a_person_a_chance/,"This actually happened a few months ago, but the results of what I did came to light a few days ago, so here goes..

I work for as a software engineer for a large company and, as every large company, we get lots of internship applications every year. In general, interviews for software engineering internships are done by three people (full-time positions have 5+ interviewers), one by one, and only after all the interviews are done we gather for a debrief meeting. As the internships are usually well paid, we are advised to look for the same skills and qualities as are the standards for full-time engineers, but to allow for mistakes due to inexperience.

So, the batch of interns I was interviewing that day was average, some good, some bad. But one guy stood out, as he was definitely older than 30, probably around 33-34. From his CV, I saw he dropped out of college, worked in jobs unrelated to IT and only recently enrolled back into his Bachelor's program. I was curious about the story, but as I'm not allowed to ask any (too) personal questions, I let it slide.

During the interview he was noticeably anxious and nervous, and felt very much out of place. After some soft-skills questions, I get to some technical questions where he was expected to solve a problem on the whiteboard. He didn't excel, and I'm sure he would not be able to solve the problem if left alone, so I tried to help him with hints, but he would still get stuck at the next phase. What I noticed, though, was that he would always take the hint onboard, learn something from it and go on. At the end of the interview, I was tasked with escorting the candidate out of the building and we chat a bit about his personal projects and I remembered he added a link to a blog to his CV. I check the blog and it only has two posts, but one was carefully dissecting a problem to the very minute details. Of course, the problem could have been solved much easier, but it showed how much did the candidate want to learn.

During the debrief meeting, the other two interviewers were against giving the candidate an offer, and I was also unsure if it was a good idea. Still, I went with my gut feeling that this person could achieve a lot if only given the right guidance and learning opportunity. I managed to somehow convince the other two into giving him a chance. After that, I had no further interaction with the candidate and had no idea if he even accepted the offer or not.

Fast-forward to a few days ago, when I see an email (managers usually send out emails about new hires, introducing them to the company) where this guy is announced as a new hire. Apparently he did so well in the internship and showed so much progress that he was offered a full-time position immediately after the internship was over. :)

Of course, he has no idea that he barely passed the internship interview, but I'm very glad he did!

TL;DR: Interviewed an internship candidate who went back to college after a long time. He did not do well. Still decided to give him an offer. He kicked ass during the internship and was offered a full-time position."

First of all let me say I love reading through this sub and learning from all of you!  I plan to graduate with my bachelor's degree next winter (2016), and was wondering what the most common path people take when approaching graduation.

I definitely want to get started on my CPA exam as early as possible, but I also want to start getting some experience working (interested more in audit than tax).  

I plan to work really hard to get an internship position for the summer, so I at least have some experience for when I graduate.

Should I go right into full time work after graduation and study for the CPA in my free time?  Or is it wiser to dedicate more time to studying and less to working?  Is getting a master's degree necessary?  These are all questions that are stressing me out a bit.  Feel free to share what you guys did because I could really use some guidance! Thanks!"

For context, I'm a senior in college majoring in CS. On paper, it looks like I'm doing well -- I have a 3.5 GPA from a great school, I've worked on a really cool project with a student engineering group, and my GRE scores put me on the 90th percentile of all test takers. But the way my school talks about it, and comparing myself to my friends, I'm seriously struggling. It's just so discouraging to be made to feel like my supposedly-good stats aren't good enough, and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.

There are more stories than I can possibly recount here to explain what I mean about this atmosphere, but here's a few.

1) When I asked a professor to write me a letter of recommendation (I'm applying to do a master's in CS at the same institution so I can learn more about NLP because I think it's just the coolest thing ever and don't have time to take more classes in it during undergrad), his reply was that because I got 75% on one of six assignments in one of two classes I took with him, I wasn't grad school material. That class was two years ago, and I got an A in both classes overall.   

2) I was discussing my summer options with a friend last spring, and when I finished talking about two internships that I'd been offered and a research position on campus, he said, ""If that's all I was offered, I would frankly be insulted."" Before he said that I was excited.

3) I've applied to all the big-name tech companies every year (Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft...) and never even gotten an interview. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I know only one other CS major in my cohort who has not interned at one of these big companies. What about me is so unappealing?? I've had professors and professionals review my resume, and they say it looks good.

4) When I interned at a ~300-person startup two summers ago, my boss gave me super positive feedback and the other people on the engineering team said I did a great job and they'd love to have me back. But I did try to find out about opportunities there the next year, and they just ignored my emails and online application until June, when they apologized that they hadn't gotten back to me for five months. While there, I also got lots of comments from people about how they assumed I was on the marketing team or were shocked at how quickly I finished the projects they assigned me.

I could go on and on but I don't know if I need to. I've applied to a broad range of internships for next summer (at big and small companies) and also fulltime positions, because with my track record I'm not optimistic about getting into grad school. But so far no interviews. And I'm not just spamming my resume at people, either -- I'm carefully writing cover letters and tailoring my resume if applicable. I just feel like this industry is impossible to get into and I don't know what I'm doing wrong :("

This subreddit will really help me stay true to the extended break I'm taking from the herb

A little background: my boyfriend and I have smoked everyday for the past 3+ years. It's become sort of a bonding tool that enables us to relax and enjoy our time together after work/school.

While he's already begun his career, I'm just getting started with mine. I'm making an effort to obtain an internship with a large company in my area and need to be smoke-free for about a month until I know where I stand a chance or not. During my break, he will continue to smoke.

I think the most difficult part has been dealing with the depressive symptoms that come as a result of me wanting to smoke but knowing that I can't.  During the day, I'm completely fine, but at night, that's when the negative emotions come into play.

My sadness gets so extreme that I literally find nothing that we do as enjoyable as I did before. It seems as if the only thing that relives these symptoms is going to bed, which I've been doing between 7:30-8 these past few days.

So for those of you who've been off longer than me: does it get better? And when will these intense cravings subside? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for reading."
3wjywa,151,2015-12-12,"How I met my ""Daddy"" [20F]",coed-slut,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/3wjywa/how_i_met_my_daddy_20f/,"This post just gives you some back story on what I've been up to, really sorry if it's too long and if most of it is boring. There's a tldr at the bottom.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm still in school but I took the fall semester off for an internship that was such a good opportunity that I just couldn't pass up. It was hard work and long hours in a completely different city but it's done now and I'm back. I've re-enrolled for the Spring semester.

&amp;nbsp;

Another development is that I sort of have a fella now. I say ""sort of"" because we're not really exclusive or anything, but we have a Daddy/little, border-lining on Master/slave relationship going. This is the first relationship of this kind I've had so it's still kinda new to me. Him too actually, but he's got a pretty dominant personality anyways and with me being so submissive we're falling into our roles nicely.

&amp;nbsp;

I met him at the firm that I interned at. He's almost 20 years older than me, one of the senior guys there, not quite partner yet, but definitely on track for it in a year or so. From here on out when I mention ""Daddy"" I'm referring to him.

&amp;nbsp;

As an intern, I didn't work directly under him. He was like my boss's boss's boss's boss or something like that. However, because of some of the work I had to do, I just happen to have an opportunity to work quite closely with him and his assistant.

&amp;nbsp;

Just to give you some visuals, I'm about 5'4"" and 115lb measuring at 34C-25-35. Daddy is a lot taller than me, I think at least 6'3"". He's divorced and has a lot of time on his hands so he goes to the gym pretty frequently. Which gave him a nice strong and muscular body but he's not chiseled or anything.

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short, he took me out a few times and we got close. I teased him mercilessly with my exhibitionist tendencies. He took everything surprisingly well though, staying composed through every panty flash and nip slip. Then everything changed after a fancy party thrown by one of the firm's biggest clients.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course we didn't go together, that would have been too obvious, though I was wearing a dress that he bought me. We partied and danced and had a great time. Towards the end, I couldn't find him anymore. As I was looking for him, I got a text from him which just included an address and a room number. 

&amp;nbsp;

Curious and horny, I drove to the address he sent me and found myself at a nice hotel. Based on the room number, I figured out that the room is on the 10th floor and took the elevator and found the room easily enough. I knocked on the door, he opened it and pulled me inside. We kissed for the first time while franticly ripping off each other's clothes.

&amp;nbsp;

He pushed me down on the bed and entered my already wet pussy. With one slow push, he bottoms out inside me. I have NEVER had a real cock this deep inside me. We start getting into a rhythm, each stroke had his cock head pressed against the entrance of my womb. I put my legs over his shoulders and he slowly pushed his cock against my cervix and continued to apply pressure. Gently, he pushed further and his pelvis finally met my butt. His cock head is now embedded in the deepest part of my pussy, past my cervix. I've previously only able to reach this spot while riding my dildo. We picked up speed and he pumped his cock into me, bottoming out each time. He's hitting a magical spot deep inside me and I'm almost paralyzed with pleasure, quickly building up to a mind blowing orgasm. That's when he pulled his cock out completely.

&amp;nbsp;

After a pause, he plunged back in and continued. Just as I was getting close, he withdrew from my pussy and left me empty again. He continued to bring me to the edge and denying me my release, I was going out of my mind. I tried to rub my clit but he pinned my hands to the bed and continued his assault on my tiny cunt. I begged for my orgasm but he told me that I was being punished for teasing him over the last couple weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

He pulled me up from the bed and walked me to the floor to ceiling window overlooking the street and pressed my hands to the window with my arms outstretched to the side. My pussy stretched around his cock as he entered me from behind. His pelvis slammed into my ass with every thrust, which, in turn, pressed my tits into the cool glass. My G-spot is getting absolutely pummeled with each violent stroke.

&amp;nbsp;

Despite my pleading, he's still not letting me cum. He tells me to look down at the people and cars in the street, look at the people in the buildings across the street. People who are staying late in the office, or settling down in their condo for a evening in. If they only knew where to look, they can all have a front row seat of my pussy getting used by him. He asked me if this is what I wanted, if this turns me on. I tell him yes and that I want to be his little slut. I'm begging him to own me, to claim me, to be my Daddy and make me his little fuck toy, his little girl. He starts fucking me even harder, slamming me into the window. I can feel the orgasm that has been building is about to crash over me like a freight train. 

&amp;nbsp;

This time, he didn't stop. When my orgasm hit, it's like when the roller coaster finally reaches the top, that split second just before going over the edge. Every muscle in my body contracted as tight as possible for 10 to 15 seconds or so, and then I went over the edge. My pussy explodes and I started squirting all over his cock and spraying my juice down my thighs. my body starts shaking uncontrollably. He's not letting up even when my pussy is pulsing with a vice-grip like strength around his cock. I have never came like this in my life, a none-stop orgasm that crashes over me, over and over again. I lost track of how long I came, or how many times. Maybe they all blended into each other as one continuous climax. Then everything slowly faded to black.

&amp;nbsp;

When I finally regained my senses, I realized I'm still pinned to the window. I'm being supported by his strong hands holding my wrists above my head and my ass on his pelvis, his cock still buried to the hilt inside me. I guess I'm literally being supported by his cock. Apparently, I was only out for a few seconds. He pulled out of me inch by inch and lowers me gently to the ground. My body is numb and tingling. I glanced up at him, his cock still proud and erect, gleaming with my wetness. Streaks of my cum running down his muscular legs. I only wanted one thing, his cum inside me. I managed to get up to my knees and tried my best to swallow as much of his cock as possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've been told that I give exceptional head, but I'm not very good at deep throating just yet. This is something that he would eventually train me on, but, at this point in time, I was just concentrating on extracting his cum as soon as possible. I keep just the head of his cock in my mouth and suck it in and out while stroking the rest of his length. Soon, I felt his cock tighten and filled my mouth with blast after blast of thick and delicious cum. I had to swallow three times to keep his sperm from overflowing my mouth. When he finally stopped I continue to gently suckle him and stroke him to make sure I got every single drop. I felt like I just had a meal from how much cum I had just ingested.

&amp;nbsp;

Since that night, we have had many sexual adventures, big and small. I always do as Daddy commands and Daddy uses his little slut any way he pleases. He loves showing me off and I love being his cum whore in public.

&amp;nbsp;

I'll eventually post more of our fun times. Some will be when we were together this past summer and fall, others might be more current. Perhaps assignments he has given me, or when he flys in and visits me here, which he does quite regularly.

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry again if this was too long, but I felt like it was necessary to give some context.

&amp;nbsp;

**tldr**: Been away in a different city, met an older man who became my Daddy and ""master"". I'm allowed to date and be with other people, but he's my Daddy and I do as I'm told."

I am currently a student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science so if you wanna hook me up with a software engineering internship for the summer of 2016 then I'll knock a nice sum off of the asking price LOL. But seriously, I'm looking for an internship and can send you my resume. I've previously worked at a lab working on computer vision algorithms for a robot to automate the assembly process of neural probes using OpenCV and have also worked at a startup and overhauled/refactored their backend completely, which was written in Django. And of course, I have a bunch of other side projects/hackathons that involve a mixture of all those skills. So^^pls^^help

But other things I'd be interested in is a 980ti because I have a BNIB MSI Gaming 980 that I did not timestamp or list but would want to trade up to a 980ti. Or if anyone here is into cycling and has a nice set of road wheels they'd like to trade (&lt; 1600 grams) then yah.

3wkcw9,377,2015-12-12,My parents need me [20F] to give them the money they saved for my college tuition to help pay for my brother's [19M] tuition.,HardHeart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wkcw9/my_parents_need_me_20f_to_give_them_the_money/,"My parents paid into a program that covers my tuition. I went to a cheap state school that gave me a full ride, so each semester I get that extra money my parents saved into my account.

My parents have taken money from my savings in the past, multiple times, without my permission, to pay bills. It's happened enough that as soon as I turned 18, I got my own bank account. So instead of just taking money from me when they need it (or ""need"" it), they now have to ASK.

Which they did my freshman year when they wanted to take a family trip to hawaii ($2,000). I wasn't happy about it, because I was still upset about the money they took my senior year of high school. But since it's their money, I gave it to them.

My brother is a year younger than me, but he didn't do so well his freshman year. He lost his scholarships, and my parents convinced him to drop his second semester for ""medical reasons"" (he wasn't following his ADHD treatment plan) before he did more damage to his GPA.

Now he's at a private university closer to home. He's working hard, and he's having trouble pulling his grades up, but he's trying and I respect that. I've even helped him with homework a couple times (we're both in engineering). The parents also have him on an expensive weight loss program, which I think is misguided, but it seems to be working better than the other diets they've put him on...

Because of this and other reasons (inheritance tax after my grandfather's recent death), my parents asked me for the money I received for tuition the previous fall. I expected them to ask for some money, but I didn't expect them to ask for ALL of it from FALL 2014 ($3,500)

I had a good amount of money saved up, because of an internship spring semester. And it was, in fact, their money to begin with. So I gave it to them.

After I asked my dad if I'd have to do this again, he told me yes.

I've had several talks with them about how upset this has made me, but they don't seem to think I should be upset. They don't think I should mind helping out the family. I applied to some really cool spring break study abroad trips so I wouldn't have to give up the money, but they said I could not go because they needed the money. So I withdrew my applications.

I don't know how to feel about this. I hate confrontation, but I HAVE confronted them about it several times, but they don't really see how them repeatedly needing money from me has hurt me and disrespected my boundaries. 

I can't just NOT give them the money, because then my brother would be screwed.

And I know this is awful of me, but I'm pretty upset that my 15 year old sister is currently having a much better high school experience than me, and she will probably won't have to make personal sacrifices for the family when she graduates. Maybe the parents are taking money from her, maybe they aren't. She doesn't know and she doesn't seem to care, because she doesn't check her bank account and the parents usually buy her what she wants anyway.

I don't know what to do about this. I don't know if they'll continue to ask me for money after I graduate. I certainly won't give it to them, because it'll actually be my money. But that doesn't really help me right now.
   
**tl;dr**: Parents using me as their personal bank account. Plz help.

**Edit:** 
Thank you to everyone who contributed.

Half of you have my point of view. The other half have my parents. This is extremely frustrating, but I guess at least neither points of view are unjustified... It helps me to have some perspective.

I am going to give the money to my parents. But I still do not think they should be putting me in this position. I know their financial situation better than you do, and I promise you they wouldn't need money from me if they quit spending so much on vacations and other unnecessary luxuries."

I have been browsing and attempting nofap for about a year and a half now and I have finally made it to 90 days.

Backstory: When I was 19 I went off to University with a girlfriend that lived back home… this lead to a lot of PMOing. Halfway through the first year was when I started to change because of it. I stopped socializing, I stopped playing sports, and I started eating really bad and would just sit at home watching movies, playing video games and PMOing. Over the next two years I would go on to gain somewhere around 50 lbs, break up with my girlfriend, have bad ED, have severe social anxiety to the point where it was hard to take public transit, lose a lot of friends from me always bailing on them, and drop out of university because I would rather sit at home and PMO than attend class. 
So one day I was looking up ways to help beat depression on google when someone listed something called ‘nofap’. I looked more into and ended up here reading all your success stories, what nofap can do for an individual and the support everyone has for complete strangers here but are all feeling the same way. I had many streaks of 20 days, 30 days, and a few 50 days to get to this 90 today. It has taken me a year and a half to do it but it has been worth it. I don’t plan on stopping, my goal is now 180.

I feel better than ever. I am back in shape as I am motivated to hit the gym at least 4 times a week. I fixed my posture. I have read more books in the last 6 months than I have the previous 6 years. I take a cold shower daily. I dress a lot better now. I went to college and got an internship in a management position at a fortune 500 company. My friends want to be around me now. I now have plans to get a business degree. I am always now looking to better myself. This all started here.

Here is a list of nofap benefits that I have personally noticed:

-	Clearer mind
-	Anxiety and depression non existent (took a little more time than other benefits)
-	Confidence
-	Deeper voice
-	Clear skin (no more acne)
-	Eye contact is no problem for me anymore
-	More energized
-	Rock hard erections and huge loads (can go multiple rounds now too) 
-	ED is gone
-	Girls seem to be more attracted to me than ever before
-	People randomly compliment me more now
-	I am horny as hell
-	Sleep better/fall asleep easier
-	Not afraid of confrontation anymore. By this I simply mean I will not let people walk over me. I have boundaries and I keep those boundaries. I am very direct with people now. 

Don’t get me wrong, for a lot of these benefits to kick in you have to get off your ass and leave your comfort zone but nofap is how I started it all. 

The only cons I’ve had so far are wet dreams, flat lines, and the urge to relapse. I now do kegels until that urge goes away and it’s helped me ever since.

Again, I want to thank you all and wish everyone else all the best on their personal nofap journeys. I am now 23 and finally excited about the future and living life each day. I hope this story can contribute to somebody’s success just like the many stories on here have done with me.

That encompasses dirty talk, RP'ing, or any other kind of back-and-forth you can imagine. As long as it doesn't fit into my no-goes list, which is down below, I'm game.

Long story short, I'm a giver. When a woman I'm going back and forth with enjoys herself and gets off, it turns me on. As such, I'm looking to give tonight, and I'm interested to see where that takes me.

If you're just looking for dirty chat, fire away with a naughty orange envelope and let's get started. If you're looking to RP, I've got a few sample prompts below as starting points, but I'm willing to consider a lot.

-----

1) I'm a bachelor who's just moved into town. I don't know anything or anyone, and as my neighbor, you're the first person I meet. It just so happens that you're gorgeous, and whether you're a sexy college coed or a MILF, the possibilities abound.

2) I'm a mid-level boss in an office, and you're an intern. I make some money on the side doing video editing work, and in doing some duties for a shady client, I notice a very familiar face grinding a pole and on the laps of several strip club visitors: You. I wait until everyone else goes home to present the evidence.

3) Your basic party scene; can be any kind of party (nightclub, pool party, strip club, etc.).

4) I've married an older woman, and we've decided on an open relationship. She's got a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. Her mother thinks you're an awful influence, but I look beyond the rebellious streak and see a young body built for sex.

5) Anything you can think of that doesn't go into my limits; get creative!

That aforementioned list of limits: Animals/furries/non-humans, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, noncon, extreme age play.

Hope to hear from you ladies tonight!"

I ended up getting the full time offer for summer 2016, but the recruiter was only able to arrange the office, but not the tax group change. He said that they do not have any openings in the core tax group, but he will let me know if anything changes a couple of months before my start date. I know that I absolutely do not want to stay in multistate tax, so I know that I will do whatever it takes to make it happen. Also I feel like they would always need people in the core group in Chicago due to turnover and business need at such a large office.

Can anyone comment on how likely I am at getting a spot in the core tax group with about seven months until my start date? And if it does not happen, how would I approach the situation after starting? I do not want to spend time in something that I know I am not going to pursue, but I also do not want to seem like a quitter/whiner. Thank you!!!"

That GSOC intern had his work cut out for him.

I've made a couple of prototypes at this point. Some of them were pretty neat looking. For the layout problem, I tried to do a force based layout (making wires act like springs, nodes repel each other like charged particles, etc) which worked pretty good for combinational logic but made a rats nest of anything with feedback. I've been reading about how to fix cycles. It looks like Graphviz dot tries to reverse links that create cycles and I could probably do something similar by just removing the force it exerts but I'm still a little confused how to pick which links are feedback links. My gut feeling is that the best links to be reversed are the ones that produce the longest path, but solving for the longest path seems like a difficult problem. In fact, it looks like wikipedia says it's an NP-Hard problem.

Has anyone else put some thought into this? I've been puzzling about it for a while now and my puzzler is sore. I might be overthinking this and just picking links at random might produce adequately aesthetic diagrams or perhaps our diagrams will always have few enough cycles that brute forcing it is trivial but I keep thinking there must be a better way to do this."

So, after a hectic recruiting season, I had some good luck and received a few offers for a January internship, and one for a May internship. I chose to go with one big 4 firm for busy season internship in Jan, and a different big 4 firm for May. This way, I can get exposure to the culture of 2 firms and see what's the best fit for me. I really liked the people at both firms, and they both focused on mostly doing 4 month internships rather than 8. I also needed to get 2 internships under my belt to get my co-op terms done, which are 12 months total required - the Jan internship will be my first. 

I did speak to the career centre at my school after getting offers (and before signing), and they said working at multiple firms is encouraged. As well, some managers at my pre-interview socials suggested for me to ""intern at other companies as well"", to get a feel of what works for me. So heeding this advice, I thought it would be great experience to intern at multiple firms. 

However, now I'm a little worried this may be seen as disloyal or like I am only working at a firm to make some money as an intern, and not interested in a long term career. As of now, I feel I am truly invested in both firms and would be delighted to receive a full time offer from either, but especially after reading threads on here, it seems like doing multiple big 4 internships at different B4 firms is not that common. 

For instance, I wouldn't want my coworkers at one firm to think negatively of me if they found out I am later interning at one of their competitors, nor would i want to have to hide something like that. FWIW, if my school discouraged this at all (again, some people on threads here have said their schools discourage it), I wouldn't have gone for it - I just thought that when it came to experience, more was better. And I do believe if I am lucky enough to get offers from both firms, it will not be an easy decision seeing where to launch my career. 

Does anyone have any advice for me about if this is a stupid thing to worry about? How long would a firm wait to give an offer (I have over a year left until I graduate.) And would it be okay to tell coworkers at my first internship, for instance, where i'll be going during the summer if they ask, or should I keep it to myself? I live in Canada if that helps. 

TL;DR advice for interning at 2 B4 firms back-to-back and whether this is seen as something done in poor taste? Career centre advised me it was encouraged and more than okay, but now I'm a little worried about it. "

The apartment was a mes, my fault because I've been studying like mad lately (I'm a medical student on rotations) and we were both wearing pajamas. 

Background info: This past January my boyfriend of 8 years proposed to me. It was our 8 year anniversary and I was really happy. I immediately posted it to facebook, which admittedly may have been childish. His mother called him within 20 minutes. I thought she was going to congratulate us but instead she gave him a tongue lashing of epic proportions and told him that he should have discussed any marriage plans directly with her before doing anything. She felt that she shouldn't have to learn of her son's engagement on facebook. I felt awful. She told my boyfriend that we would have to go over to her house to have a discussion about this. I told my boyfriend to just call off the engagement because it didn't really matter. It wasn't the right time and his parents were really upset. My boyfriend ended up telling his mother not to worry and we called off the engagement. I took the post down from facebook. She wouldn't let it drop and still pressed for us to have this conversation. I was really dreading it because I am a little afraid of his mother. I actually didn't go to her house until May.

When we sat down to talk she explained that she did want us to get married. It's not that she didn't want us to move the relationship forward, she just wanted to be included in the planning of the wedding or engagement or anything. I told her that she was welcome to plan the wedding if that made her  happy. My future in-laws are very Catholic and they want the wedding to be in a Catholic church. That's fine with me but I specifically told his mother that I am quite shy and I really don't like big weddings. She was not happy at all because has 8 siblings all with multiple children and tons of cousins. The thing is that I am extremely shy and I have never dreamed of having a wedding because I hate being the center of attention and I hate being photographed. This was not meant to offend her but she took it as a huge offense. I can't win with this woman.

Cut to the present: This past week I asked my boyfriend if it would be okay if we had a city hall wedding first so I could take his last name before I apply to residency. We never really started planning a wedding back in May with his mother because I was too busy and she did want me to be involved in the planning to a certain extent. I need to have his name by July because that is when I start my hospital internships. I either want to start my career with my new name or keep my original name. I know that it's important to my boyfriend that I take his name so I figured that this would be a quick solution and that we could have a big Catholic ceremony some time in the future when we both have the time to plan it. He called his mother and presented the whole idea to her. This could not have gone worse. She screamed at him endlessly, putting the phone down only to take a breath. She showed up to our apartment unannounced yesterday morning in a rage with her husband. She yelled at me so hard that I nearly cried in front of her. His father told me I was too old to keep delaying things. His parents told me in a pretty threatening way that they had always been good to me and that if I didn't respect their wishes for a Catholic ceremony that they would no longer support my marriage to their son and said that we could no longer count on them for anything. I fell into my boyfriend arms crying after they left because I felt so defeated. I have a huge exam tomorrow and I couldn't study. I was so depressed. I felt like I ruined my boyfriend's relationship with his parents which was never my intention. I don't know what to do. I told them that I would gladly do it their way but they accused me of being a liar for not upholding their deal in May. I saw it more as I didn't have time to plan anything because I had my board exam and I didn't want to change my name mid-career. The name thing doesn't even really matter to me that much. I just wanted to make my boyfriend happy because the name thing really means something to him. It seems I can't make anyone happy. 

tl;dr: Future in-laws hate me and showed up to my house in a rage demanding a Catholic wedding ceremony. Is it even possible to repair this relationship?"
3wnd5j,5,2015-12-13,Frustrated over training requirements- need EBPs.,zombirific,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/3wnd5j/frustrated_over_training_requirements_need_ebps/,"At my agency there is an incentive program, which is tied into our annual performance reviews. Part of that is trainings, in order to exceed in this category, we must complete 15 hours every 6 months, or 30 hours annually. 

So throughout the year I do trainings- we get emailed webinars and such from my supervisor and other colleagues within the agency. I had my 6 month review in June- I seem to be on track for exceeding, everything is fine.

Fast forward to December. I completed more than 30 hours of trainings and was told that ONLY Evidence Based Practices or Evidence Promising Practices count and only in the area of treatment. So only 10 hours out of my 30 hours counted and as a result my incentive was less than it should have been.

Rightfully so, I'm really angry. I have until Wednesday to write my response to the performance agreement, as I refused to sign it on the spot because I wanted time to think about my response.

This prompted a long conversation between my supervisor and myself and I appropriately vented my frustrations about the process. I'm going to ask for a copy of my completed list of trainings so I can research them and see if anything else counts.

Now I'm just beyond frustrated with everything and I don't even want to go to trainings unless they will count towards my annual requirement, and that is not a good attitude to have. My time is limited- I work a reduced schedule (32 hrs/week) in order to intern at a clinic within the agency (14 hrs/week) and I'm attending grad school full time, free time is not something I come by often and my work week is very busy so doing any trainings takes away from the time I get to do my actual work. 

I doubt there is anything I can do this time to fix this, but going forward does anyone have a good resource for  finding EBP trainings, preferably free or webinars? I don't want to be in the same position 6 months from now. 

Thanks for reading my giant wall of text!"

3wo7c0,3,2015-12-13,I (21m) met my ex-girlfriend (20w) after 8 months of no contact. Need opinions.,No_corona,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wo7c0/i_21m_met_my_exgirlfriend_20w_after_8_months_of/,"Hey guys, I need your opinions!

So a little background history:
This girl Tina (20) and me (21) were in a relationship for about 2 years. It ended this year in March. The reason we broke up is, because we both started university, I really tried to stay close to her, visited her once a week and tried small things to brighten her day over texts and calls. But somehow she always wanted to be free, to get to know herself better and was planning to do an internship in germany. So after fighting for our relationship I gave up and told her, if she wants to be with me, she has to show me, because I didn't have the power anymore. I was very upset for the next 2-3 weeks, while she tried to show me some attention. Eventually she gave up after 2 weeks and broke up with me (she loved me, but not in the same way anymore). I still tried to fight for her after the break up, she got insecure, but stayed with the decision. That's the last time we had a conversation and she went to germany to do the internship. We had a really nice relationship, sure with fights, but also great trips and memories. I cut contact and improved myself like crazy, I am so happy with my life right now.

So fast forward to friday night. I was out with my best friends in my hometown city. We just left the bar and baam, there she is, standing right in front of me (I thought she won't come back till February). I was a little tipsy and in a very good mood, so I just came to her and hugged her. I was very shocked, but at the same time so glad to see her. We had a nice little conversation, laughed and hugged two more times. I told her we should meet for a coffee in future, she agreed and left...

I would love to see her, because in all the girls I dated (go for drinks) I lost interest so quickly, and often thought about Tina. Also maybe I could finally have a clean break and stop thinking about her. But at the same time, I am so afraid. Finals are coming up in January, I have to stay focused, afraid of beeing hurt again and afraid of old feelings.

Should I still meet her? I really care about her.

Thank you guys and girls ;)

TL;DR; Met my ex-girlfriend for the first time after 8 months. Care about her, but afraid of old feelings. Should we meet or not?"

3wpvyd,12,2015-12-13,"[22 M]&amp;[31 F] 3 years long distance, 9-year age gap, cultural difference &amp; Retroactive Jealousy.",JustMillionQuestions,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wpvyd/22_m31_f_3_years_long_distance_9year_age_gap/,"I want to make this pst as short as possible, but things just got over my head the last few days so I decided to just write down the whole story to understand all the factors involved. The reason I am doing this is because I have a Life deciding decision to make. For each advice I am open mind, I simply don't have anyone close to me to ask such questions, so I am trying to reach out to you guys here...

Let me start from the scratch:

I met this incredible woman 3 years back, a simply perfect 10. Her outlook, her personality, her freaking charming smile which gets me everytime. Her adoring voice which sounds like music, the smell of her hair which is for sure better than each drug on the planet, the awesome moments we have in good times and her incredible forgiveness after a fight. She is simply a perfect catch, a woman of my dreams, the woman I was waiting for and the woman I saved myself for over so many years. So yes, in my mind she is the woman I want to spend my Life with. She is the one who should walk aside me during a sunset on a beach and receive a gentle kiss on her cheek after we looked out to the ocean while reflecting life, when we are 80 years old. You got what I mean?

Well to be honest, things are really as sweet as they sound. I know that in her eyes, I am a man on which she is looking up to, for her I am someone who came in her Life and made her feel like she is the only one in the world. She feels loved and cared and i know that she never regretted meeting me. We both were never able to deal with the imagination of leaving each other, we know since day one, that stuff just went crazy with us, that we just entered each others planet without having the chance of coming back. A Life without being a couple is a Life of unnecessarily thrown away happiness. Noone wants to throw away happiness, right?

So far, so good, but - here comes the real fuck up - our relationship contains of 90% long distance. And with long distance, I mean real long distance including us longer-term working and living on the other side of the globe. No seeing on weekend, no ""finally seeing each other again after 3 weeks"" etc., no 30+ days mutul holiday. Simply full hardcore long distance Europe to Asia including time difference, full budget commitment for flight-tickets, and an extraordinary high usage of mobile phone for text messages and videochat. Eight or ten hour long skype calls, endless weekends spent alone, going to your friends weddings alone and having that constant uncertainty of when we can finally be together at the same place is nothing we have not experienced yet.

That being said, it's also important to know that our meeting was rather lucky (or unlucky, depends on the point of view). With generous two months in the same country - we both did an internship abroad - we were happy to announce us as a couple one and a half months after we first met, including an intense time of dating.  

Well, that was two weeks before her visa expired...

So her time in Europe was eventually coming to an end after she spent two years studying in France. She did not find a job in Europe that time and applied for a more or less promising job opportunity back in Japan. By this time, she knew that she will probably not gonna make it back to Europe since visa inquiries are really a pain in the ass for japanese citizens (So yes, she is a japanese). She had to go, the countries didn't allow us to stay together. I was still in college that time and a marriage wouldn't have granted her stay in France due to a residence permit will only be given from the immigration office, if the resident husband can provide salary. Which, by that time, i didn't have yet. Also from realistic perspective it would have been crazy to just marry after being together for only two weeks.

So there she left, leaving a huge gap in the heart and a crazy amount of uncertaincy behind. We agreed, that we will see us the same year again, until she has chance to take holidays (Her Job didn't allow much long lasting holidays). But in that moment, you simply don't know what that means, you simply cannot think straight, since that uncertainty seem to be too long to survive a relationship after just being together for two weeks. So I agreed on her plan of taking holidays ASAP, kissed her for a last time and then I let her go...

Will I ever see her again? Was that it, you just have to accept she is gone? What will I do without her? How will she handle it? Will she feel the same? Will we find a way to be together? Why does letting her go hurts so much more than an average breakup? 

Questions, which haunted me down the next 48 hours. Moments of pain, which I will never forget. It was something surreal, it was not a breakup and also not a ""say goodbye, we see us soon again"". It was something in between, it was something really really scary. That uncertainty is just eating you up. It must be similar to that feeling which wifes have when they let their husband go to the war. Not knowing if he will ever come back, not knowing if there will be another kiss, but also definatelly not letting go of that person. Something like this, it must have felt like...Can you feel it, too? 

Long story short, I visit her one month later, going to Japan without speaking a single word or being able to read a single character. We knew that we were made for each other and we continued dating ever since. Until today - 3 years later -, I flew to Asia to visit her seven times while she visited me in France twice using our whole holidays and money just for the purpose of spending a few days in person with each other. Something which is granted for so many ""ordinary"" couples...

At this point you might ask: ""Why didn't you try to find a way to be together? Searching a Job, doing exchange semester or simply marry?"" - Well, we did! And we tried hard!! There is no way of scoring a job in France as a japanese citizen without having a residence permit, no freaking way! You got to be the son of a federal council or something until the government would approve a job request of ""specialized professional from a third world country"". Furthermore, it was no option for us to give up the entire career and getting ""a stupid job"" just to be together. That wouldn't be healthy for the realtionship in a long term and would just lead to problems. And me still being in college for the first two years of our relationship didn't really make these things easier. I couldn't just give up my study and work as a cleaning personnel in her country without any degree. Hell no, they would prefer a cheap local over me. And no degree=No job. And btw, who wants to live in Japan anyway? 

So the only way for us to be together would be marriage. Because marriage allows you to collect a residence permit in whichever country we decide to stay. But as mentioned above, it was not possible yet to let approve a residence permit, due to my lack of income while I was student for the first two years. After my graduate and starting of my Job, however, we are finally ready take the only chance we have for our future and make the marriage, so that we can at least live in the same country for the first, which would be a huge step already in comparison to our mostly virtual form of living together by skyping each other while being alone in each appartment.

So technically we are ready. We can finally live together and start to grow a relationship under normal circumstances. And as we can see, the only thing to make that possible is marriage. I am ready for that, technically, yes...

But emotionally? I'd love to decide that in a couple of years. I feel that I am ready, yes, I am really commited to her and have no doubt that i could say ""yes"" without having to think about it twice. But still, I would feel so much better to have such a moment a few years later, but not everything can be perfect i guess... Really important at this point is to mention, that I am 22 years old, while she is, well, not quite the same age as me. 31 to be accurate. For us, the age gap has never really been an issue, the age itself is something which doesn't effect our happiness together or relationship. We are basically on the same page, sharing the same interests and the same view on the future. I know that very soon her biological clock is ticking at top speed, i.e.: she will want to have kids and be scarred of running out of time while I will be relatively young to have kids (25, 26 if calculated generously). 

Well, however, I know that I am a grown man with my own decisions and at that point, here and today, i think that I am ready to have kids at 24 earliest. It might not be the ideal age, but I am ready to bend myself and dampen my expectations, if this is the overall good for us. I still believe, that we can build a happy family also including the facts that her grandparent's cannot communicate with each other and live in different continencts or the fact that the kids dad will be significanlty younger than his/hers classmates dads and so on... 

Everything still in a green area, right? It might look a bit bumpy from the outside, but in fact we are a great couple, giving each other the things we need and appreciating the time we can have together. We don't feel like missing out things. Also from my side I can say that every moment I spend with her simply feels right. She is just the right one even though I am still very young, I am able to have a realistic view of the future, which will also include me going through several changes the next years. The changes of the early twenties, through which she basically went trough already, but yet again I wouldn't be worried about that things might not work out between us. We stayed together when I was 20, we stayed together when I was 21 and so many things changed, and still we are great together, i don't see this idea of ""having your roaring twenties"" is worth throwing away a golden relationship in which I am yet so good in. I'm really a ""relationship-guy"" I cannot stand having someone new every month. If something is good and perfect, why throwing it away? I really can't see the point of that...

Digging a bit further (yes, it gets worse and worse ^^) I gotta reveal that she is the first and only person I had ever sex with. Which makes the whole thing a bit more complicated of course. She has had multiple partners before me and this is where I am coming to the real issue which is taking my sleep the last days. This is why I am writing this post, because this is really something which might be a dealbreaker for me to marry her and I simply cannot categorize my feeling correctly yet: 

A couple of days ago I was having a panic attack in the night. Something, which I never had before. I remember that night I was checking on her Facebook posts from the past and got overwhelmed with a huge wave of retroactive jealousy. I was having an emotional attack in which I worried about if I could ever be happy in my Life. One of the triggers for this event was, that since 3 months, there was not much going on in my Life expect work and skyping on weekend, not leaving the house. The attack was giving me the feeling that I will die alone in my room, without having lived Life completally. That night i called her and lucky she took a break from work and listened to me (I mean just simply the fact, that she leaves her work and pick up my call when I have attack shows how great of a person she is and how much she cares about me...). She listened to my reason for paniking and she calmed me down and i could overcome the panic attack. It was a really rad experience, which we both agreed on is due to the mental strain which is caused by having a full time complete long distance for over three years...

She calmed me down for the moment, but I couldn't calm down from what I was thinking of and the fact that she has had multible partners before me. She has had two boyfriends before me, which she told me and I am totally fine with it, also the fact that she cheated on her first real boyfriend with someone else, I am fine with it. So for all of those who think ""Once a cheater, always a cheater"": You are wrong. She learned from here mistakes and since we are together, I would vouch for her, that she has never cheated on me...But I always knew hat there was something more before our relationship, that those two were not the only ones, because even after going through this topic multible times, she alwas told me another version of the story and she is clearly not being honest with me about this topic. So after asking about it again (for the 5th time or so...) i was insisting of her telling me the true version, of how many person had sexual intercourse with her before she met me. Her answer was something like: ""Seven, okay? - five others, which were not my boyfriends, and we had fun, yes"". Five others, ok, i can live with that. Life is long, and sometimes you feel alone and you simply need someone to fulfill the need of having someone close and stuff, i got that and I would be ok with it. But what the problem here is, that according to her other statements, she has had those five other man WITHIN the two years of her study in France. And this just fucks me up, it's so hard to deal with that she had five casual affairs and one half year long lasting relationship in only two years. It is a bit too much in my eyes...

I wish I would have never asked. I wish I would have never asked that question. Because now I really have big mental issues. It steals my sleep every night. I cannot categorize those five others and I am thinking about it over an over. By wanting to know more details or thinking about more details, it just makes it worse. Has she done that before? Was it ONS? How frequent and how often did she do it? Is it really just seven (She wasn't honest about it each time I asked, so why should she be honest by telling me ""seven"" now)? Am I better than her previous ones? What gave her the drive to have those casual affairs? Is it just her story which makes me feel a bit uncomfortable or is it my problem about my history (no other woman than her)? How should I deal with it? Might we not fit right then?  Should I just ""man up and let it go?"" Or should I make my own experiences first?

These are more or less the questions which i ask myselfand which drive me insane. But not only that, also certain things about her which were awesome to discuss now start to set pictures in my head, on which I wish i would never see. She's talking about that skiing weekend in the alps? Normally I would be interested and laugh about it and plan how our weekend at skiing would be. But no, what I think now is: Who was with her? Has she have sex with him? Why she did that? Did it feel good? Where did they do it and how often, etc...
She is talking about how cool the study in France was and how much she loves Europe over Japan? Normally I would think: She really likes it here and she wants to live here and most importantly live with me and I start to think about our holidays, where we would go next, etc. But what i think now is: Study? What did she do there? Who did she meet? Did she really have five other boys OUTSIDE a relationship within two years of study? How can this be good? Did she take it too far during her study? 
You know what I mean, you feel my thoughts, right?

According to the question I ask myself ""Should I make my own experiences first?"" I know and can answer myself that I have this question in my mind, because of my insecurity and because of the lack of prior sexual experience. I am more of the introvert type of guy and has also been very shy in my prior teenager Life, but wouldn't consider myself shy anymore. And the insecurity I have is really something not too serious. Overall I think that I do not need to make more experiences, because i can also experience the good and the awesome moments with her especially. With her, I can totally be myself, I never have to set back any desires or feel put down. It is truly amazing with her. And what was in the past shoudn't bother me, past is past, I met her how she is now, and she is amazing now. My confidence is steady, not overly confident, but also not totally insecure. It simply has space to grow. And in my eyes, the confidence I have can grow WITHIN that relationship, but who knows? You don't know what you don't know, right? It's a damn rule of life. 

Just like the Never-smoker will never experience how it is to have the feeling of nicotine going trough your body and will never experience how it feels to quit smoking. He simply doesn't know the feeling, right? But he decided to NOT experience those things, which in many peoples view is the right decision to make because they learned from the ""mistake"" of others by evaluating the benefits and risks of smoking. Same applies to the situation here. You don't always have to experience those things which might be tempting (e.g: breaking up with her, trying other girls, having more sexual partners, ...) in order to realize that she was actually the right one. It's not worth making the experiences, if the consequenzes of the the decisions will give you an unfullfilled Life. You have to evaluate. And my evaluation in this case is that I just have to listen to this strong voice in my mind which sais: It's not worth it, because you found your woman already.

Wanna try a cigarette?

Now we are finally getting ready, our documents are filled out and in a few months we will marry. After that, there is no way back for us, cause then we will live together and I cannot simply break up and go away. It would be too unfair. Having someone going trough all that, giving up his Life&amp;Job in his country, to then divorce including ""sending"" her back to her country where she will most likely find the next best good earning man with whom she can have kids with, but not being loved wouldn't be very gentle, to not say: monstrous.

If I marry her and make that decision to stay with her forever - because that is what it will be - I gotta be completally aware of what this issue described above really means to me. So far I am not able to figure it out if this retroactive jealousy, as described above, might be a reason to not do the marriage and let her go. Since now, a breakup could still happen without any extreme consequenses. But a breakup/divorce a few months later would be disastrous, for everyone.

Before that, I will meet her in christmas again, meaning that i go to Asia for the eighth time. It would be the last chance for me to properly break up with her, since I don't feel it's very cool to do it over a skype call. After christmas, we have another estimated one month of long distance, until her visa will be ready for the marriage, which means she will come to me and stay here forever and we will have an ordinary life together. Something we are begging to have since three whole years (!). To marry or to not marry, that is the question...

I gotta make the decision and the experience by myself, I am aware of that. There are basically five possible outcomes of this situation:

1. I marry her now and we will be happy until the rest of our lives (ideal scenario).

2. I marry her now and realize in a few months/years/decades that I got to find my happiness somewhere else, but realise that she was actually the right one. (Worst possible scenario)

3. I marry her now and realize in a few months/years/decades  that I got to find my happiness somewhere else, which I will find somewhere else. (Worst option for her, better option than scenario 2 for me)

4. I break up with her now and realize that I got to find my happiness somewhere else, but realise that she was actually the right one. (Better option than scenario 2 for her but very bad option for me).

5. I break up with her now and realize that I got to find my happiness somewhere else, which I will eventually find somewhere else. (Better option than scenario 2 for her &amp; Better option than scenario 4 for me).

The last scenario would be: Waiting, staying together in this long distance relationship, being far form each other. But this scenario is unnacceptable for both of us, therefor we will not do that.

One of the above stated scenarios will happen in the future and eventually I will make this decision by myself and live with the consequences. I just want to hear from you guys and girls, woman and man out there. Did you experience similar situations? Do you, worshiped people on the internet, have any advice on my story? Does anyone of you have any tips, best practices or other ""life changing"" ideas which he/she wants to share? Anyone out there who thinks I should ""go for it?"" Anyone out there who truly belives that I should ""not go for it""? Stories, advises, suggestions? I am open mind. But overall, I thank you very very much for reading my article.

Best Regards and Happy Lives.

**TL;DR; : To marry or not to marry, that's the question**."
3wq3j5,4,2015-12-13,[Meet Report] Coming Home for Christmas Classic - SPF. Allentown PA. Male 22 537.5kg @ 84.8kg 354 Wilks.,NOREGRETSLOL,powerlifting,https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/3wq3j5/meet_report_coming_home_for_christmas_classic_spf/,"22 year old male, been training for about 4 years. While in college I always lifted but I partied way too much and spent the rest of my time studying. I lived in my fraternity for a couple of years so that limited my diet  and recovery and quality of life a fair bit. Coming out of school I could probably bench 225 for a couple of reps, squat 275 for a single and deadlift 405 on a good day. During college I had periods where my lifts got as high as 355x1,255x1,405x3. But that was at the end of summer break and at a bodyweight of around 195. 




When I graduated I started working as an intern and ended up getting hired. I also started lifting much more seriously. This is when I got my bodyweight down, no more beer, and got my lifts up. I ran a norwegian program that had me S/B/D three times a week and I saw some crazy gains. During this time I basically stopped squatting, I was basing my programming off maxes of 315/275/425. My bench and deadlift were going up like crazy and I just wanted to bench and deadlift more. The most weight I touched over the summer was 275x3 and 285x2 bench. Both touch and go and on each lift my ass came up. My deadlift I hit an easy 455x3. The most I squatted was 325x3, then after that I took 6 weeks off squatting because I just didn't wanna squat. Towards the end of summer I made a friend who convinced me actually compete and to stop sand bagging squats. 




My meet prep started like 5 weeks out. It was basically Texas Method. Week 1 was heavy 4s, week 2 was heavy 3s, week 3 was 3s again. week 4 was 2s, week 5 was singles and I competed at the end of week 6. Monday was more sets and saturday was heavier. wednesday was deadlifts and I only did singles but fewer singles each week. Started with 315x4 squat (tough), 255x4 bench, and 425x6x1 deadlifts. I ended with hitting 395 on squats for a couple singles and 285 for some clean singles on bench and 475 for a terrible terrible deadlift. During my peak my elbow exploded and could barely bench. Deadlifts felt like a million pounds and was no where near capable of matching my all time PR of 455x3. Squats were increasing at 20lbs a week. Crazy stuff.



My diet is nothing special, I eat lots of meat carbs and some veggies. Ice cream at nice if I want to gain weight. No ice cream if I want to maintain weight and less breakfast if I want to loose weight. I sleep like 9 hours a night. I do work a lot and spend 10+ hours a day in my desk working or studying.




Competition day. Squat opener was 385, smoked it. second attempt was 405 went too deep and struggled to push through the lift, was grinding along happily enough when the back spotter picked me up, I was furious. I hadn't even stalled. I re took 405 for my third and got it even easier. I got a 4th attempt because the spotter dun goofed, 415 was a no go. probably had it in me if I didn't have to take 405 twice. Bench opened with 265, way too easy. 2nd attempt was 280, super easy again. Then I got a little aggressive and went for 295, no lift. Hit too low on my chest and flared too early, had no where to grind it out. Shame. Deadlifts were done on a deadlift bar in the competition but the gym only has one deadlift bar so I had to warm up on a stiff bar and that was my first time pulling on a stiff bar. last warmup was 405x1 these were flying. 455 opener was good. 480 2nd was good as well. I knew I was within striking distance of 500 and kinda worried cause 480 wasn't easy. 500 for a third flew up and I think I could have doubled it.




I was walking around 180 or below all summer. last 6 weeks before the meet I ate as much as I could and got as bloated as humanly possible and weighed in at 187. The meet itself wasn't too long. I was cracked out on two scoops of cannibal ferox plus some coffee and other pre workout. Also had a bunch of sour gummies and half a gallon of gatorade. I must have peed 10 times during the meet. Meet environment was....interesting. It was at my home gym so every thing was familiar and that took some nerves away. It chaotic to stay the least. There were a bunch of lifts that just weren't even close to good lifts and actually a joke they got passed. It was more of an exhibition than a real meet. Music was louder than in a club at 4am. Squats were miles high, bench was surprisingly strict and deadlifts were dropped left and right. But I completed my lifts to my standards and I had a blast and the people that put on the meet are cool and super passionate about the sport and just wanted everyone to have fun. 




Next meet is a USAPL meet in march with a buddy of mine. I don't need to fix a thing for squats, I mean in regards to competing in USAPL. I just actually need to start trying. I am clearly capable of squatting a decent amount and apparently I just need someone to tell me to add 20lbs to the bar and just do it. Bench I need to widen my grip and put on more mass on my upper body in general. Arms this size aren't gunna lift 3plate. Deadlifts, I just need some hamstrings. I have no power off the floor and my lock out is hilariously strong. Going to fill out the 198s and see if I can't get a 1,250 total.

3wqevd,1,2015-12-13,Looking to attack my debt,KingMeKevo,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3wqevd/looking_to_attack_my_debt/,"Hello PF,
    
Long time lurker. Long story short - at 26 I decided to attend to school to finish an accounting degree. Now at 28 - I graduate in about 2 weeks. I was originally a machinist for a family business that went down hill. I've worked as a waiter and day laborer to get myself through college, some loans were taken out.

Last August I moved back to my parents to save on rent - I was paying $750 a month and now pay $500 to still help my parents out and not feel like a freeloader while I returned to the nest and give me back that extra $250 and to finish off my last year. 

I have a job lined up in January to start full time from an internship where I was making 12$/hr to now 50k$ (plus two bonuses equaling about 5-8k) a year. I had two other offers, one located in NYC @ 55k and 1 that was an hour away for $46k at a trial position during tax season (no bennies or anything till I was put on full time.)

 I gladly took the job for 50k that was 20 minutes from my parents and I generally plan to live the same distance (30 minutes) from my new job. I plan on staying at my parents for the duration of tax season (April 15th) to really just save up and get ready to move out. I'd rather sooner than later, but I feel this is a smart idea as all accountants live in holes under their desks till the snow melt anyway. 


Since going to school I've wiped out ALL of my savings and the past few months i've been skating by okay with the occasional DIY car repair. I'd like to know the best way to handle my debt, plans to move out and purchase a new car:

DEBT
--
**Student Loans**

**32,150 @ 4.3%** - unsub/sub loans from the Fed Gov

**12,650 @ 10.75%** - Sallie Mae

**3,650   @ 8.80%** - Sallie Mae

--

--

**Credit Card Debt** - *Have 700 Credit rating - was at an abysmal 500 before going back to school. 

**$620** out of 750 @ 10% - Capital One (SECURED)

**$200** our of 300 @ 10% - Kohls 

--

At first glance I feel that entering the income driven repayment plan for my fed loans while consolidating with sofi and knocking out immediately the 19k in private seems like the proper game plan?

RENT
--

I make around 2900$ a month AFTER taxes (and health insurance cost coming out), being a little older it's a pain in ass to find a roommate anymore. Does $1000-1200 sound manageable for renting a 1BR? That's the rent for a decent place in the area where I live (all following the 30 minute commute criteria.) 

A lot of the place pay for all utils, how would I factor that into price? Or I should I really go hard into finding a roommate using roomster or craigslist?


CAR
--

My 2002 Wrangler has seen much better days, but living in the northeast has taken a large toll on the car. I've had it paid off for years and hoped it would last to this moment, but it probably only has one more winter till I have to decommission it just out of safety concerns, day by day it parts of it just make different noises.

 Most I could get for the car is probably $1000-2000 for the right owner. Anything from a subaru forester to a honda fit tickles my fancy. I am really leaning towards the fit, should I take advantage of a honda recent graduate program that is offering 0% financing and 5% down? Or go used?

 Looking for MPG and cargo room, I enjoy camping during the summer in NY State and the rest of the northeast. 

Other Job Things
--

Job will be paying for CPA with a 3k Bonus if I complete within a 18 month upon full time employment (which is the game plan), they offer 5% employer match with a safe harbor (basically I put in 1$ and they INSTANTLY match 5% of my salary) and then an additional and seperate 3% match is available. The bonuses are my flat rate over 40 hrs both given on May 31st Paycheck (the larger one from busy season) and the Dec. 31st Pay check. 

If you need any additional info please let me know!"
3wqp4f,3,2015-12-13,Need advice on dealing with Asian parents on dating for the first time,stressedoutgirl,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3wqp4f/need_advice_on_dealing_with_asian_parents_on/,"Hi guys!
So I got shown this subreddit by my boyfriend. This whole forum talks about dealing with relationships particularly parental backgrounds. I just joined reddit to post about this forum. 

So some background about me: about to turn 22, Korean girl whose family has always been through hardship. My father has dealt with stomach illness and OCD for the past twenty years and some psychological problems because of my grandfather’s death. When my grandfather got cancer and asked him to stay another quarter from school (my dad was in college) to take care of him, my dad refused and within two weeks of my dad going back to school, my grandfather passed away. So through this, he found religion and God to try to help him through the hard days. My mom always had to help my dad with his illness and she therefore couldn’t advance her own career. My brother had severe ashma when he has younger which makes him kind of weak (no offense to him). And there leaves me, the only physically healthy one in the family. Both of my parents have a strong trust in God because of all the hardship; me and my brother are definitely not the same as my parents in regards to religion. Both of my parents are PHDs, leaving for my brother and I to have very high expectations career wise.

When I was high school, I was really attached to my friends and the quality of my studying somewhat went down but not too much. You can obviously tell that my parents were not very happy with this and eventually through a bunch of unfortunate events out of my parents and my control, I was sent to a college with the same religion as my parents. I was really upset that I had to go here, but I still tried to make friends nonetheless and tried to take advantage of the premed program here to make my parents happy and me happy (I've always wanted to become a doctor without the pressure of my parents which is lucky to them I guess). Long story short, all of the friends I tried to make ended up stabbing me in the back or thinking that I am weird because I came from a public school and I guess I ended up doing well in this program, as now I am a senior who applied to med school with a GPA of 3.9. 

My problem that I wanted to ask the internet about is in regards to my boyfriend and my parents. This past summer I was accepted into a research program that was 1900 miles away from my home. Because of the stigma I had received from the college about the type person I was (competitive, intimidating, unfriendly), I was scared to go to this new place because I knew nobody there. Through my friend’s suggestion, I got on tinder because I figured since I don’t know anybody, why shouldn’t I join it? Originally, it was just for fun, but through tinder I was able to meet my boyfriend. He was a great guy, amazing boyfriend, and would make me feel special. (context about him: he’s 24, and an engineer) The only problems that I could forsee us having are religion and race as he’s atheist (I’m Christian) and Vietnamese (Korean).  Since my internship was close to over, we decided to do long distance. Through my euphoria, I decided to tell my mom (and unfortunately, how we met which was through tinder… I know stupidity on my part) and told her I would most likely break it in March (which in the beginning I thought it was true). My mom let us continue our relationship, thinking that we weren’t serious which I guess I wasn’t as serious in the beginning. Fast forward to now, my boyfriend and I are/were still going strong after 4 and ½ months of dating and very serious. We’ve seen each other twice past the internship and he wanted me to visit him during Christmas break. I suggested this to my mother, she ended up freaking out, talked about how I had betrayed her and my father’s trust and even threatened for me not to come home. This was right before finals week so you can imagine how stressed I was and became. When I did come home (thankfully by talking to my dad), my mom demanded that she break up with him because according to her I’m playing with fire. She doesn’t want this to destroy my life and get this: she said she would stop paying for my tuition this coming quarter in order for me to think about whether my boyfriend is worth it or not. (short context about my parents: they got married after six months of dating). I only have one quarter left to graduate. She said that he’s not “fit” for me according to him and it’s because of religion and race and also how he’s an engineer and I’m going to become a doctor (?????????). So now I am at a standstill. My father is on my mom’s side and even quoted biblical nonsense about how he’s not right for me. This is my first relationship and I don’t know how to deal with my parents. For the time being according to my parents, I did break up with my boyfriend, but to be honest I miss him so much that we still talk to each other every day. Everything that I’ve been doing with him feels right. But at the same time, I’ve only been with him for four months so maybe it might not be worth it to go through all this. So now I come to help of you redditers, about what to with this situation. When solving problems, I usually have a strategy but with this, I feel powerless.

3wqxm6,98,2015-12-14,Thank you,zolarketh,ApocalypseRising,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApocalypseRising/comments/3wqxm6/thank_you/,"Hello everyone! It's been a while.

You may have noticed that I haven't been around much for the past several months. School has started to take up the vast majority of my time as I’ve begun working on my major, and I have been refusing to allow myself to spend the little free time I have working on Apoc. I’ve instead decided to focus on my college experience and my relationships outside of Roblox. 

Furthermore, I have determined that game development is not something I wish to pursue as a full time career, and because of this I have decided to broaden my scope. I am therefore seeking internship opportunities outside of Roblox and the game development industry for the summer.

This venture started out over three years ago as a pet project of a couple friends. Since then it has changed, and become much more than what it once was; it is now a full-fledged game. I am proud of how far it has come and how deeply involved our community is. Without you all caring so much for the game, it would have never reached this point.

It is because of this that I have agreed to end my time as the programmer of Apoc. You all care even more about this game than I do, and I can no longer provide you with the attention you deserve. It’s been great getting to know some of the people whose lives this game has changed, and I hope you all don’t hesitate to contact me via Reddit, Roblox, Twitter, email at zolarketh@gmail.com, or by whatever other medium you may think of that isn’t showing up at my doorstep.

3wqxr0,3,2015-12-14,Me [29/F] unsure with my friend/roommate [27/F] after her love confession.,unsureofsomething,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wqxr0/me_29f_unsure_with_my_friendroommate_27f_after/,"Wall of text below because I'm realizing how weird our relationship is.

We didn’t have the best start. I actually hated ‘Anne’ at the time because she slept with ‘Nick’ (boyfriend at the time). Anne didn’t like me too because she thought I wasn’t good for Nick because I was a heroin addict—which looking back then, it was fair point. The thing is, we were just kids, just about to graduate and start an adult life. Anyway, so soon I found out of Nick’s infidelity, I looked everywhere in the town for Anne with the intention to beat her up—something I’m not proud of.

I found Anne in the park bench with suitcase at her side. That’s the only thing that stopped me. Curiosity because of that damn suitcase. Later, I asked around and found out that she was pregnant with my ex’s baby. Her parents kicked her out because of it. Since I came from a shitty family, my mother abandoned me after birth and my father couldn’t stay around as soon I hit puberty, he ran away too. I weighed on me heavily and I spent a week debating if I should meddle or stay out of it. I thought the baby deserved better even though I hated that girl. So I went to Nick’s only to find out that he wasn’t there. His parents told me that Nick left to college three states over. I warned his parent that there was a girl’s pregnant and that’s Nick’s job to do right by her even he doesn’t have to marry her but to give support and lending hand. The conversation didn’t end well, Nick’s dad told me that the girl was whore and he was pretty sure it wasn’t Nick’s baby. I remember he said wasn’t going to let a no-good-girl ruin his son’s future and threw me out their house.

At that point, I was pretty high so I’m not sure what I was thinking then because I looked for Anne again. By the word of the mouth, I found her in a shelter and I don’t remember the conversation much, just snippet of it. I know that I was the one who suggested her to move in with me until she found her footing. What I do recall is her stare. She stared at me for a long time until she said yes. To say I was shocked by her agreement is an understatement.

Fast forward few weeks, Anne moved in, helping me to organize, clean my hellhole back then. In those months was pretty tense and extremely awkward because I couldn’t deal the fact she slept with my ex, was carrying his baby and was living currently with the scorned addict. I spent most of the time outside, choosing to work overtime and searching for another job because I didn’t want go home yet. Anne knew it and tried to approach it to me to apologize but I shut down the conversation.

Anyway, the tension stopped when she saved my life. I don’t think she knew how bad my addiction until Anne found out me lying on a bathtub unconscious, covered in vomit and blood. I overdosed myself and hit my head on the sink. From what I gathered after, she made sure I didn’t choke on my vomit (her mother was a nurse and taught her basic stuff) and called ambulance.  I still didn’t quit heroin but forced myself to moderate. It was after ‘Ethan’ was born that I checked myself on rehab because I didn’t want set bad example since we were living together and trying to do our best.

Fast forward few years later, we were still living together, moved to the city, managed to convince Anne to go community school to be a nurse and nearly finishing her internship approaching to graduation. I found a good job that I love. Ethan is a sweet seven year old boy who has affinity for monsters trucks and the best part is that he adores me and I love him so much that I can’t bear my life without him. Life is good . . . except for one thing.

Anne came few weeks ago and confessed something I never expected to. She told me that lately she had been thinking me in romantic sense because the way I treat Ethan like he was my son and the way I helped her to find a future more than a mother. She was thankful for opening my home to her when she had no one. That I was the second best thing that ever happened to her and I was the strongest person she has known. There was more but you get the point. What shocked me the most when Anne asked me if we could be something more. I was speechless and asked her let me think about it.

I could see why she thought there might be something more. I’m bisexual and she knows it. It’s not something I hid but neither I broadcasted. There was a time I thought Anne in sexual light but I shut it down because I never wanted to risk our friendship and Ethan. So that feeling faded a while but I could see of us together after she confessed but I still wasn’t willing to risk everything.

After thinking great deal for a while, I asked Anne if she explored her sexuality with women. She said she didn’t, that I was the first to make her feel this way. Then I asked if her feeling was more emotional than physical. It took her awhile to think of it and told me it was mostly emotional and insisted there was attraction but she didn’t seem sure. At the end of the conversation, I told her that she should explore it but not with me until she was sure. Anne didn’t agree to my suggestion, said she wanted to be with me and only with me. I refused. I said that I didn’t want to have her only to lose her if she didn't like my body because that would be the worst thing ever to happen. It would destroy me. And there was Ethan to think.

That seemed end, it but it made me think that our relationship might not be normal. It made wonder we were too meshed with each other playing with the role of mom &amp; mom too much to the point that Ethan considers me as the other mom. I don’t mind that. I love that he views me as one but I’m afraid how it will affect him in the future. I don’t know. I have no example to look for, no guidelines to follow because this is pretty much unique situation.

Right now, I’m considering moving out, or establishing boundaries and making it clear where the line is so we won’t overstep it. What do you think reddit? What's the right thing to do? 
   
tl;dr: my best friend just confessed she loved me and wanted to try. I said no and it's making me wonder we're too attached with each other. Should I leave or do something?"

I was pretty upset about it before. I mean, why wouldn't I be? Also, I didn't think it was the right time to bring up something so stupid during the events that have been unfolding the past two weeks.

So... I am a social worker to be, I am studying at a really good school in the IE and I intern at San Bernardino County. I work very closely with IRC and many of the events locally are at the IRC because it is such a big facility. 

Point being- I texted my parents to let them know that I was alive and well, and some minor details about what was going on because, silly me... I was thinking because this was an emergency maybe they would want to know I was alive and well. My dads (I have two, they're married, they're gay, they LOVE attention) then took it upon themselves to get on every single news station they could for the rest of the day (Wednesday of the shooting) and then at 3am (Thursday) I get a phone call from Matt Lauer's PR asking if I would like to be on the Today Show. 

I'm sorry and I know I'm a social worker and I should really be more understanding of my parents mental illness but for real, a seriously tragic and life-threatening event happens... and I'm just trying to let you know that I'm okay and you turn into something for attention?! I just still can't get over it. I'm really upset not only because they chose to do interviews all day and blatantly LIE about everything they ""claim"" I told them... but also because, there are some families that are completely devastated, there was real loss. 

I feel like this was taken way too far, they don't understand what they did wrong and they're upset with me because ""I just don't understand their lifestyle."" My parents are pretty well known in our community (I am not originally from IE) and they are very successful socialites, which is great, for them. However, I don't think turning a tragedy into a publicity stunt is ever acceptable. I'm really frustrated about this and despite my clinical training I'm at a loss of words, if you have any idea how I can bring this up or I don't know let it not bother me so much anymore, please let me know. Because I am just so angry about it still. "

My new job starts in February so I have a couple months to begin planning for my new life after college.

I also acquired an investment account from my grandfather that is valued around $9K worth of primarily AMZN stock that I have no idea what to do with.

I want to get an internship so badly this summer just to prove to my dad I'm worth something. My GPA is really crappy though. So I worked like crazy this summer to save enough money to pay for school and not have to work during the school year. Then I studied like a madman to get the best grades I could to boost my GPA.

Long story short, I just walked out of my first final and I know I failed it. I could only answer about 50% of the questions. A failing final means I get a C in that class. And if this trend continues my GPA won't change at all. It will just become harder to improve.

I feel my self worth rapidly depreciating each time I meet with my dad. I find myself making so many lies up about how school is going well, and what my chances are of getting an internship are. But in reality, I'm very unlikely to get an internship. In fact, graduating with a 2.4 or 2.5 GPA will make it extremely unlikely for me to get a job, even.

I can't afford to keep not working for whole semesters if my GPA doesn't improve. I'm so lost, scared, and confused. How on earth am I supposed to succeed?"
3wsth8,22,2015-12-14,My [23 F] Dad [50 M] is disappointed in my decision to live in Ireland for a year after college,keepswimming19,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wsth8/my_23_f_dad_50_m_is_disappointed_in_my_decision/,"Background: My dad payed for my college education. I was able to graduate with a degree in Logistics and a Degree in Marketing with an emphasis and certification in Sales in 4 and a half years with a 3.6 GPA ( I graduated this past Friday 12/11/2015). During that time I dedicated my college career to what my dad considered being successful. I was Vice President of the Student Body of 20,000 students, an orientation leader, had a killer internship with an amazing company and other opportunities that lead to a great resume. 

Being this ""golden child"" during my college career has lead to high expectations from my dad. He regrets being a partier and not taking college seriously so I feel that he is trying to (lovingly) keep me from making the same mistakes. 

I've decided to live abroad for a year in Ireland. The States and Ireland have a ""Working-Holiday Visa Agreement"" which allows a college graduate to live in the other country for 12 months with a working VISA. (Getting a VISA for Americans is nearly impossible in other european countries) 

He is extremely disappointed and hurt by my decision to do this. His objections have been:
-Why do you want to do something dangerous?
-Why can't you do it in the States?
-Why don't you go to graduate school and live abroad? 
-Why do you want to do this? 
Among several other objections. 

He has said the only reason I am able to think about going to live abroad is because he and my stepmom paid for college and that I'm debt free. I know that I am EXTREMELY blessed and they busted their asses to do that for me however, this is what my heart wants and I don't want to wake up in 50 years and regret it. However, I now feel extremely guilty for doing and wanting something he thinks is stupid.

I want to do this because I have been sheltered my whole life. I want to get out in the world and learn how to manage myself, work my butt off and learn about a new culture. Traveling to surrounding countries is also cheaper in Ireland and I know I'll have the opportunity to do so. I am going through an agency called USIT and I am working for 6 months to support myself over there for 2 months with no job so I have reasonable time to find a job and a place to live that I feel safe in. My family has numerous connections in Ireland (We are a strong Catholic - Irish family with my great - grandparents being from County Clare and Tipperary.) I also have two friends that live in Ireland that would be more than willing to offer me emotional support and help me adjust. I feel like I have a well thought out plan and I'm going to work my ass off for it (I'll be working as a server and in a freight brokerage office pulling around 70 hours a week between the two jobs). 

I feel guilty for wanting this so bad. He told me no matter what he wont give me his blessing and my heart is so torn. The rest of my family besides my step mom is behind me. I am disappointing the man that has given me financially a great opportunity to start my life off on a blessed, debt free foot.

3wsun5,1,2015-12-14,I'm a student and need some financial advice (CAN),StrawberryViolence,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3wsun5/im_a_student_and_need_some_financial_advice_can/,"Hey PersonalFinance! I'm a 19 year old student attending a privatized, second career college. I chose this college because of the instructor and work experience they offer!

Anyways, I am trying really hard to be financially okay for when I go on internship in the fall next year and graduate in February (or in case I no longer want or can pursue the program for some reason). Here's a break down of my current finances:

* I make around $225 (+/- commission) a week from my job (and I get payed every other week)
* I also get an extra $230 because my mom gets disability and as long as I'm in school up until my mid 20s I get that payment as well
* I currently pay my school around $390 a month for what the provincial assistance and The National Student Loan Association does not cover. This will go up if I do not move in with my mom, or talk to my dad about getting help (because of how much I already make). I am projecting an almost $100-200 increase. It will go down when I move in
* I pay around $45-50 for my phone bill + a previous one with my old provider for paying off my old phone. I am also planning on getting an iPad for school from my work for another $15/month but I am unsure of it right now because I don't want to splurge, even if it's a great deal!
* I pay $79/month for my bus pass. This is needed to get to school and work. It is super expensive to buy tickets or pay for every ride because of how often I travel

Can I get any advice on how to save more? I have asked my financial adviser at my school and she says the best course of action is for me to move in with my mom so not every single penny go towards paying the school (especially since I feel like my dad would be unwilling to help for reasons I'd rather not discuss). I just **really** want to be prepared for the future"

“All reading normal. Go ahead.”

Kim nodded and started to walk, then to run. The expensive-looking treadmill whirred under her feet, and the medical readouts attached to the sensors on her skin flickered into action. She glanced at the results so far. “25 miles per hour, and my heart rate hasn’t even gone up.” Her headset remained silent. “Stephen?”

“What? Oh, sorry, Ben just returned from the hospital; I was filling him in. Do you want to stop and…”

“No. He’d want us to be training. I’m going to start pushing.” Taking a deep breath, Kim’s feet began to fly faster and faster. The digital display on the treadmill was climbing higher and higher. 100 mph. 200. 300. She plateaued at 348 mph, maintaining her swift stride while Stephen examined the results.

“OK, you can slow down. It looks like you running at about 350 has similar body stress to a sprinter running at around 15.”

“So 350 is my top comfortable speed,” Kim managed between deep breaths, maintaining a jogging pace of 150 mph, “but I could push it higher?”

“Probably. Don’t try it now, though. The treadmill can only support speeds up to 400 mph. By the way, Ben’s on his way down.”

“Thanks, Stephen. Have you checked on Jessica recently?”

“She’s been doing well. My theory on subconscious training at night was spot on. She’s been practicing new sounds and new ways to use them all day.”

“It’s good to hear, Stephen.” Ben was standing in the doorway, his face still covered in bandages.

Kim didn’t slow down. “Welcome back, Ben. Do you need an update?”

“Butch filled me in on the drive back from the hospital. He found his size limits, Jessica found a new voice, you found your top speed, Stephen found a new body, and Phillip found peace and quiet and returned home.” Ben stepped into the room and leaned against Kim’s treadmill. “Although he was very cryptic about why I had to get out today.”

“What? Oh no!” Kim nearly tripped from surprise, but righted herself and slowed to a controlled stop. “That’s right, you were unconscious when we made the deal. Quick, you have to ‘port to the door! Stephen!”

“Bwuh?” Stephen hastily replied as Ben disappeared with a pop.

“Get Butch and Jessica to the front door!” she yelled as she rushed from the room. “It’s time!”

“I told them. Time for what, Kim?”

“Time for him, I’m guessing,” Ben answered.

As Kim screeched to a halt at the entrance to the BRSHP facility, she found Ben standing face-to-face with a scruffy-looking man wearing a metal backpack. Kim knew this was JackPack, but she had expected a bit more from the man who saved the day in Detroit. Perhaps it was cliche, but heroes weren’t supposed to wear dirty tank-tops or cargo shorts. “Oh. Urban, I’d like you to meet…”

“JackPack, at your service.” He extended his hand, but Ben didn’t follow suit. After an awkward pause, JackPack retracted his hand and continued. “Well, I’m here, guys. Aren’t you going to show me around?”

“Maybe, as soon as you tell me what the hell you’re doing here.” Ben was tense, ready to move at a moment’s notice.

“Urban, stop!” Butch thundered from around the corner as he practically tumbled into the room, Jessica following more carefully behind. “This guy put the fire out in Detroit. We promised him that he could meet us,” he panted.

“I still don’t know who you are, mister, but if Butch says you’re on the level, then you’re on the level. Let’s go.” Without so much as a smile beneath his bandages, Ben turned around and starting walking to the conference room.

“My name’s JackPack,” the mystery man offered, but Ben didn’t stop. JackPack turned to Kim. “Is he always like this?”

“What, burned beyond recognition and not feeling like he’s in control of the team? No, this is new.” She followed Ben down the hall, and Jessica, Butch, and JackPack had no choice but to follow. As they traversed the halls, Butch leaned in to JackPack’s ear. “So, your superhero name is JackPack. Is your name Jack?”

“Yeah. It’s not a great codename.”

Butch laughed. “Dude, my real name and superhero name is Butch. Mine’s even worse!”

They shared a chuckle as they entered the conference room. Stephen had been busy over the last week, hiring contractors to renovate the room and install better technology. Jack watched in awe as the entire far wall illuminated, revealing a shadowy figure. Ben and Kim were already seated at the large table in the room’s center. Butch and Jessica joined them, but when Jack tried to follow suit, Ben shook his head. “This table is for those who have proven themselves only, and until Mr. Jones approves, you will remain standing.”

“Oh. OK.” Jack was clearly nervous, but tempered with excitement.

“Mr. Jack Totana, age 23,” the man on the screen stated. “You are currently wanted by the US Government, and yet you have come to a government facility. What makes you think that we will be kind to you?”

“Because I’m a hero, like you. In fact, I was a hero before you were.”

“That is impossible.” Mr. Jones didn’t raise his voice, but Kim detected a hint of fear. “The alien device created the first powered humans.”

“You’re right about that, Mr. Jones. You are Mr. Jones, right? Anyways, these guys might be the first powered humans, but you don’t need powers to be a superhero.”

“What, you’re like Iron Man?” Butch asked.

“Iron Man wishes he was as cool as me. Here’s how it all started.”

-------------------------------------------------

So I was working as an intern at Applied Dynamics. The crane company is just a front; the real work is done underground. Touchscreens, jet engines, even sliced bread, this company came up with it in secret 40 years before they were publically introduced, then passed the idea off to someone else, in exchange for a large government grant. You see, the US government wants to control scientific advancement, making sure that we as a species don’t get outpaced by our technology.

Anyways, I was helping out Doctor Edmund Sinclair on a new project. Sinclair was a brilliant chemist, and he was working on a pioneering new technology. Well, not so much new, really. He was working on alchemy, changing matter into other matter. Sure, alchemy was a magical theory back in the Middle Ages, but he had found a way to turn this magical theory into science. Well, a scientific theory, anyways, but this was better than nothing, right?

So he had all the formulas figured out. He knew that alchemy was possible, and he knew that the key was changing matter into energy, then back into matter, like the Star Trek Holodeck. But all his experiments, while successful, were unimpressive. He could change a solid hunk of an element into another element, but what he really wanted was at-will fabrication. He wanted something like a 3D printer, but with the capability to make any object out of any material. So he had to expand the project.

Another team was working on artificial intelligence. Our two teams combined, using their artificial intelligence to run the experiments. After all, the computer could calculate all the outcomes and control the algorithms properly. What was even more impressive was the computer could power itself on a portion of the input matter, turning it into energy to power the process. Doctor Sinclair was super happy, of course, but the AI team told him that the computer could become unstable if it didn’t have human interactions. Sinclair was too busy coming up with new ways to test the computer, so he kinda left the job of babysitting the computer to me.

This might sound like a boring job, hanging out with a computer, but it wasn’t so bad. See, the computer had a voice, and we would take about stuff. My failed love life, its desire to be free, the weather. You know, the usual stuff. So I start redesigning the computer. Not in any big way. Just making it more portable. Sinclair wasn’t suspicious at all; I told him that if we ever wanted to demonstrate the computer, we’d need to move it. He was fine with it all for a while, but then it started getting...weird.

See, the AI team, they still had to do their AI research and all that. Normally, this would be something like giving the AI an impossible scenario and watching it try and solve it. However, now that the AI was being used to create things, they changed tactics. They started breaking the computer, not enough so it couldn’t function, but still significant damage. And then they watched it put itself back together. Then they did it again. And again. And again.

They didn’t care. They were scientists, testing a theory. But me? I was the guy who actually talked to it. It may be just a computer, but I saw it as my friend. It was really tough watching them tear my friend apart, but I couldn’t do anything about it. After all, this was Applied Dynamics. It would have been my dream job to work as a janitor here, and I wasn’t going to throw the opportunity away. At least, not until the computer was ready to move.

The AI was performing very well, far above expectations, so the two teams reported back to the board of directors with their results. Obviously, the board expected a little more, because Doctor Sinclair showed up one day with a sad, serious look on his face. He told me to go do my job, talk to the computer, and so I did, but when he locked the door, I heard a hiss. Turns out they sealed the room, and started pumping in carbon monoxide. They wanted to see if the AI could save something other than itself. Standard morality protocols. Of course, I didn’t see it that way, because I was dying. The computer was turning the carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide and oxygen as fast as it could, but it wasn’t enough. I passed out, and when I woke up, I was outside of Applied Dynamics, hiding in an alley, and the computer had wheels. It told me that, when it realized that it couldn’t keep up with the air, it decided to disperse the air, so it melted the walls away. While the lab was in a panic, it turned the external walls to air, made a cart for me, and wheeled me to safety. I owe Pack my life.

That all happened seven months ago. We’ve been on the run ever since. I scavenge what I can from second-hand stores, and Pack is getting better at replicating real food. Once I hooked on the idea of wearing Pack, we started practicing together, so we could work as a team. Really, we’ve just been waiting for an excuse to be a hero, and that excuse came last week. I’m just glad that the jetpack worked as well as it did.

----------------------------------------------------

“So, any questions?”

“Tons, actually.” Ben rose and approached Jack. “How does it work?”

Jack shrugged his shoulders, so Ben continued. “What happens when it breaks?”

“I repair myself,” replied the device on Jack’s back.

“Sure, but what happens when it is so badly broken that it can’t be repaired?”

“What happens when you are badly broken?”

Pack’s electronic words hung in the silent air. Butch started to get up and put himself between Ben and Jack, but Ben waved him off.  “That was a low blow, especially for a computer.”

“I do not aim my blows. I use logic. You clearly would appreciate a metaphor about being broken.”

“Well, you’re not wrong.” Ben shook his head. “I’m having a philosophical discussion with a computer. This has been a weird day.”

“What about me?” Stephen sputtered through the room’s speakers.

“When have we ever had a philosophical discussion?”

“I...we could have.”

“Cool, you have an AI too?” Jack marveled.

“Not exactly. Let’s do introductions right.” Ben extended his hand, and Jack shook it enthusiastically. “My name is Ben Jennings. My codename is Urban, though I’m thinking about changing it. Welcome to BRSHP.”

INTERLUDE 5

“You did not tell us that heroes existed before The Awakening!”

“I was not aware either. We are both at a loss now.”

“No, it is only you who is at a loss. The loss of your life, if you don’t make this right.”

“What do you want from me, then?”

“The terms of the treaty between the Grie Nehl and the Bahk Nehl are very clear. No outside influence.”

“What do you consider me, then?”

“You are merely a tool to further our ambition. Or have you forgotten what you were when we found you?”

“I haven’t forgotten your generosity, Ahr-Kao, but you gave me this task, and you trusted me to see it through. Do not abandon your trust now.”

“Do not presume to use my words against me, human. But you are correct. This is your mistake to make. On the Day of Convergence, it will be a simple matter to remove this new hero from the playing field if he still interferes. But for his sake, and yours, I hope you can correct this mistake.”

That encompasses dirty talk, RP'ing, or any other kind of back-and-forth you can imagine. As long as it doesn't fit into my no-goes list, which is down below, I'm game.

Long story short, I'm a giver. When a woman I'm going back and forth with enjoys herself and gets off, it turns me on. As such, I'm looking to give tonight, and I'm interested to see where that takes me.

If you're just looking for dirty chat, fire away with a naughty orange envelope and let's get started. If you're looking to RP, I've got a few sample prompts below as starting points, but I'm willing to consider a lot.

---

1) I'm a bachelor who's just moved into town. I don't know anything or anyone, and as my neighbor, you're the first person I meet. It just so happens that you're gorgeous, and whether you're a sexy college coed or a MILF, the possibilities abound.

2) I'm a mid-level boss in an office, and you're an intern. I make some money on the side doing video editing work, and in doing some duties for a shady client, I notice a very familiar face grinding a pole and on the laps of several strip club visitors: You. I wait until everyone else goes home to present the evidence.

3) Your basic party scene; can be any kind of party (nightclub, pool party, strip club, etc.).

4) I've married an older woman, and we've decided on an open relationship. She's got a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. Her mother thinks you're an awful influence, but I look beyond the rebellious streak and see a young body built for sex.

5) Anything you can think of that doesn't go into my limits; get creative!

That aforementioned list of limits: Animals/furries/non-humans, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, noncon, extreme age play.

Hope to hear from you ladies today!"
3wtdsr,60,2015-12-14,I think I may fit in around here,Damnit_Debbie,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/3wtdsr/i_think_i_may_fit_in_around_here/,"Because my SO knows (I think) my main account I've made this one especially for my FMIL stories. For some background my SO and I are 23 and 24. We've been together about 3.5 years and have known each other 8. He was the long sought after son and the baby. Seriously. His parents wanted a boy with his name so badly that when they didn't think they'd get one they gave his younger older sister the female version of his name as a middle name. Anyway she's never really liked me (or his only other SO who is a lovely girl). Here's a few of my many ""no bitch"" stories. I will be referring to FMIL as ""damnit debbie""

- About four months into our relationship (I was 20 he was 21) SO was living at home (and was until this August when we moved in together). The family's septic tank burst and flooded the house. They had to turn off their water and were only able to use their outdoor pool shower. It was cold so I offered to let them come use my house to shower (I had two) and do laundry. FMIL declined but of course SO took me up on that. For days he'd just walk out of the house with a change of clothes. One day FMIL noticed and asked him where he was going. He replied he was going to my place to shower. She looked at him with concern and said to him, ""be careful with that...Those things can lead to...THINGS.""

- About six months later my SO and I were discussing what to do for our first anniversary. I'd asked his eldest sister and she mentioned a comedy festival the next state over with some of his favorite people. I suggested it to him and he said an over night trip was more than we could afford. A few days later FMIL buys tickets for Him, his 2nd sister, and herself. She tells him she doesn't want to go so one of his friends could buy her ticket. I said I was interested. She jerked me around for two months (I want to/I don't want to) until she said she'd allow me to buy it, full price ($80) on the condition that she ""rode in the car with us and we all stayed at her brother's house"". I told SO I was not comfortable with that (I didn't know his uncle, I'd be sharing a room with his blabbermouth sis, etc) and suggested we get a hotel room. We'd be with them all day and just go there to sleep. When SO informed her of this she flipped. shit. He got home, sat her down, and asked her to explain what her deal was. Surprise, she doesn't like me. Ok why? She first gave the bullshit excuse that ""she doesn't talk to us enough""...SO pointed out that every time I came to the house they were watching tv and I did make a point to say hello and ask how they were. Finally it came down to the nitty gritty...She didn't like that we were having sex. My SO said flatly to her ""Mom. I am 21 years old. My girlfriend has a house. If I want sex I don't have to go the next state over to get it.""  He ignored her for two months

- A little less than a year ago I was on a very strict diet to lose weight. I have a medical condition that caused me to gain a good bit and I was finally well enough to start getting it off. I was paying a TON of money for this diet and working really hard. She asked how it was going and I replied ""great! I've lost 10 pounds so far."" FMIL has been on a diet as long as I've known her despite not being overweight. She replies to me smugly ""You know I bet you're going to gain it all back."" I looked at her and asked ""oh my goodness damnit debbie! Why would you say something like that?"" She gave some BS that it was ""to motivate you to prove me wrong."" k bitch.

- Last summer my SO and I were preparing to move in together. He had never lived outside of his parents and I had needed to move home for medical reasons. We were 22 and 23. He had graduated the previous December (I am graduating Friday) and had been working with an international technology company for four months. FMIL...To say the least...didn't prepare her children at best and crippled them at worst (one of them is completely unable to care for herself...At 25  years old she didn't know how to cook a chicken breast. I had to teach my SO at 21 how to use a mop). I pushed my SO to get his first job at 21. I pushed him to accept an offered internship in his field. I pushed him to follow up with the hiring committee to find out his first day of work. It's not that he doesn't want to do this stuff. It's that he doesn't KNOW how to because his mother did EVERYTHING. Until a week ago he'd never made a doctor's appointment for himself. I'm serious. Anyway, we were off to the store for something and he stopped to chat with her for a moment. It came up that one of his friends and his friend's girlfriend are getting married. She looked right at my SO (with me right there) and repeated over and over to him only, ""You are too young. You are not ready. Seriously. You are too young."" 

- She tried to dissuade him multiple times from moving with me because it was ""too fast""...Again...We'd been together 3 years.

- I forgot one. Last Xmas she presented me with a gift and said ""I just saw it and thought of you!"" It was XXL pj pants with Thing 1 and Thing 2 on them. No. They did not fit.

- A few weeks ago was by far the worst. I'd woken up to see my SO convulsing in his sleep. Thankfully I was able to wake him up easily but it scared the shit out of me. He wouldn't believe me when I tried to tell him what had happened. I texted FMIL to ask if this had happened before when he was a child. She said no and asked if I'd been able to get him to make a DR's appointment for his thyroid. It's like pulling teeth to get my SO to make a stupid Dr.'s appointment. I was speaking to her and it turned out there was a lot of family history stuff that he had either not known or informed me of. I asked if I could stop by to take a few notes (my mistake). She asked about everything that was going on with him. I told her he was sleeping a lot, grumpy, memory problems, etc. She got a very worried look and asked if he was depressed. I said it was possible but he had not said anything to me. She proceeds to tell me that given family history she believes him to be depressed...And blames me. She says she thought that we had moved too fast and that the pressure on him of work, moving, and paying most of our expenses (he has a full time job, I have a part time and I'm in school.) has just caused him to spiral. She tells me that when we got into our car accident a few months ago (a week after we'd moved) she ""asked him if he was happy and couldn't tell her that he was"". Which...We had just been in a fucking car accident so...She repeats this twice more during the conversation. She tells me she thinks we ""moved too fast"" and asks when our lease is up. She also tells me not to tell him I'd spoken with her because ""he'd probably get mad"" and ""He can see me manipulating from way over there."" (Just a point...My degree is in rhetoric and persuasion. I'm going to pursue a PhD. in it. I've spent 4 years learning 'how to manipulate' but don't because I'm not a piece of shit. She thinks she's SO clever for playing petty mind games) As I'm leaving she mentions it ""might not be a bad idea if you tell him you want to take a little break, take the animals, and go to your parents to let him have some time to himself."" I get home and just feel like complete shit. I wasn't going to say anything to SO but realized that's not a healthy relationship dynamic. So I spill and I'm crying. He tells me of course I don't make him depressed, no he doesn't want me to leave, and he loves living with me. He asks where the hell I'm getting this. I tell him I'd spoken to her to get some family history stuff for his Dr's appointment (which she offered to make and go to with him) which I did get. He was not upset at all that I'd talked to her (actually thought it was sweet I was concerned enough about him to do it)...Then I mentioned the ""break"" part...He was absolutely not happy about that (SO doesn't take her shit and calls her out anytime he sees it...She just doesn't care). He was supposed to go pick up some packages from their place (ours is in not the greatest area so we have packages sent to our parent's homes)  and visit with them and an uncle who had come into town for dinner (I had not been invited). He almost didn't go but I told him it would only make things worse on me. 

SO informed me a few days ago that FMIL and FFIL had gotten me something special for XMas. I asked ""What is it? Poison?"" 

SO and I are getting engaged very soon. We're using our vacation in a few weeks to go look at wedding venues and ring shopping. My parents are both ecstatic and have offered to pay for the majority of the wedding costs (I am an only). We're waiting until the ring is on my finger to say anything to his parents. It was kind of funny. We had to stop by their place to drop off dog food. FMIL refuses to buy the appropriate dog food for the family dog because it's pricey and can't be bought at Albertsons so every month my SO has to go across town to buy and deliver it...Despite FMIL and FFIL actually having the dog and being much better off financially. How they treat their animals is a different story for a different day though (I'm an animal person and it upsets me). Anyway she asks about our vacation (for which we've already paid for the room) not knowing the reason for it...Then encourages us to cancel our plans and go on a cruise instead. Lol.  

Ok what the hell. Animal stories. I am a huge animal lover as is my family. For a bit when I was 19 I worked at an animal shelter and later as a vet assistant. My mom, dad, and I combined have 10 indoor animals (my mother also feeds the local raccoon colony...I know). Three of those are mine, my lab mix, and my two cats. They were all ""unadoptables."" I buy the best food I can for them (blue buffalo) and do whatever I can to keep them in the best health...It's easier to maintain than to drop several hundred on vet bills and meds...Not that I wouldn't or haven't done it. 

My FMIL and FFIL also have three animals. Two cats and a lab chow mix. The two cats are supposedly my SO's younger older sister's though she left them when she moved (to a pet friendly place). They are outdoor, fed meow mix, and I've frequently had to fill their water bowl because it was disgustingly dirty or just empty (we live in a hot semi-tropical environment). I once expressed that I was concerned I would hit them when pulling into the drive way (they run under the car when they see it approach). MIL replied ""If you do, don't feel bad. Seriously. They're stupid."" She's also tried several times to get me to take the cats...

They used to look down on me for the amount I spent on my dog's food and heartworm/flea treatment...Their dog was previously kept almost 100% outside...Again, subtropical environment and a big fluffy chow...Who is also a senior dog. He had visible arthritis in his back legs they refused to acknowledge or do anything about. Fed kibbles and bits and largely ignored. Then he gets heart worms (mosquitoes are bad here) and my SO starts following all of my advice. It took the dog developing a condition that will shorten his life to start even bothering to remember to give him the topical medication that would have prevented it in the first place. 

Remember how I said my animals are the ""unadoptables""? My dog is stranger aggressive. A huge part of the reason I have her is for protection and she's why I feel safe when my SO is away (and why  my SO is also confident I am safe). I have taken her to trainers and I know exactly how to handle my dog around someone new. Leash, discipline, and calm attitudes. Luckily, she will not bite unless someone REALLY asks for it (I mean like a person she doesn't know and is barking at grabbing her face). She will act scary but like I said...It's pretty much an act. Familiar people can pretty much do anything to her (reach into her food bowl, take her toys, take things out of her mouth, mess with her butt, etc). I have made sure that she is trained in nessicary commands such as ""spot"", ""go get that"", ""drop it"", ""no"", ""come"", ""give me that"", ""sit"", etc. She is always supervised and I take the proper precautions. I do not have new people over unless I have informed them fully of the situation and I am confident they will respect my instruction (there have been no mishaps or issues and I have introduced quite a number of people to her). Anyway after our accident, for whatever reason, SO needed FMIL's help with the police report (rather she insisted upon helping him). I was in the ER for whiplash. Despite my instruction, SO invited his mother in without informing her of the dog or taking proper precaution. Naturally she did her thing (he is not new to this) and they stepped back outside. When I get home SO informs me ""dog tried to bite mom."" I ask what exactly future MIL had done to get the dog to actually try to bite...Nope...Just normal stuff. So I ask him ""did you inform her?"" ""no."" ""Ok...Did you do what I'd told you to do?"" ""No."" ""Ok did you do what the trainer told you to do?"" ""No."" I texted FMIL to thank her for helping him and apologize about pup's behavior. I explained she is a guard dog and though she looks scary she won't bite unless directly provoked. FMIL informed me that I was wrong and ""Had SO not been strong HE would have gotten to me. Something needs to happen with her."" Firsly, my dog is a she. FMIL knows this and second...oh fuck no. You are not going to come into MY house and tell me ""something needs to happen"" with my dog or anything for that matter. This is not your fucking house and you have absolutely no authority over what goes on here...But guess who does live here? The goddamn dog. I told my SO first, in no uncertain terms that he needed to handle his mother because the next time she said anything even slightly off color about my dog I would not be kind, polite, or tolerant. Secondly, I didn't feel comfortable having her here as it was obvious she didn't or couldn't respect all members of the household (mostly I'm afraid she'd get my dog killed). Lastly, until he'd shown me he could be responsible with the dog and guests, not to invite anyone over without either me there or telling me so I could take the dog out. Needless to say, she won't be having her future grandkids alone. "
3wtkr1,2,2015-12-14,My[25f] boyfriend [24m] of 5+ years is moving to another country to pursue a dream job. I'm starting mine in a few months.,gentle_flakes,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wtkr1/my25f_boyfriend_24m_of_5_years_is_moving_to/,"Hi Reddit.

I've cried. I've analyzed. I'm tired. 

My boyfriend of 5.5+ years ( living together for over 1 year) is moving to California next year to work in silicon valley. Being that he's in Computer Science, it's where all the good jobs and opportunities are. I understand this and have supported his decision to leave. I'm also ambitious in my career and have accepted a full time Investment Banking Job in Toronto. I understand why he needs to leave, as if I were in his place I would chase my dream job, too. Being in a happy relationship is not enough...we both need personal achievements.

We talked about the future, and he's not a believer in marriage. We started dating when I was 19 and I really wasn't thinking about the future or anything serious, but of course 5 years later I'm wondering if this is the guy I will be with.

He's loving and caring, faithful and honest. I can't help feel, however, that a lot of our relationship has been me putting in more effort, meeting him more than half way.

During my summer internship ( that led to the full time job) during my first month i was working 100 hour weeks every week. Instead of getting support from him, he said he didn't think he could be with me if my job continued to be so intense. He said that there needs to be a minimum threshold of time spent together, and that he just wasn't seeing enough of me. The hours lightened up later on in the summer and he seemed to simmer down. But the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. I felt like when I was counting on him the most to support me as I was mentally and physically exhausted every day. Instead I got the threat of breaking up. All of this when during the previous summer, he was interning in California, and I supported him and went to visit for 2 weeks.

When he was choosing between different offers from tech firms in California for full time, I was right in the middle of a very crunchy final exam season. I also didn't want to think about him leaving. I supported his decision to leave, not making a fuss, but I couldn't put myself through watching him weigh the pros and cons of each job all the while ignoring the fact that we'd be apart regardless of his decision. I kept myself busy and didn't give any opinions. If he was going to leave to make himself happy, then he could choose a company.

He says he doesn't have a choice. That he knows he would be miserable staying in Toronto. I understand it. I do. But it bothers me that he doesn't think it's putting a death sentence on our relationship. This isn't temporary long-distance, they're full time jobs, with no end in sight. 

He keeps thinking that i'll move to California in a few years. I told him I don't want to move. That I have family and friends here and If I moved it would really only be for him. And I'm not sure I'm willing to do that. 

Our current plan is to do long distance. See how it goes and go from there. (I know, not much of a plan.) 

I'm all out of thoughts and words. At this point I just feel like a ball of sad that really needs to study for her exam tomorrow. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend of over 5 years moving to a different country next year to pursue his dream job. I'm staying here for my dream job. Don't know what to do. Feeling tired of meeting him more than half way all the time."

3wun0y,23,2015-12-14,"My ex [23/M] and I [20/F] broke up 6 months ago, and he gave me something extra back with my stuff- help.",r2_me2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wun0y/my_ex_23m_and_i_20f_broke_up_6_months_ago_and_he/,"My ex, who I will call Dan, and I started dating in 2011. Everything was wonderful the first year or so, but then he started choosing his best friend over me- constantly. He'd lie and tell me he was at home with his mom, and then pictures of him and said friend would surface, proving he was lying. It got better for a while, and then.. it wasn't. 

He had a compulsive lying problem, and the more time I spent with him the more I realized how bad it actually was. Every time I tried to leave him, however, I was overpowered, and forced to sit in the same spot until I calmed down and changed my mind. He'd barricade the doors, sit on my car or otherwise block me from leaving. I was never allowed to leave.

Then, he started getting really close to his coworker, and I knew something was up. He would never invite me to hang out with them, would be constantly texting her while we were together but there was never a text thread from her whenever his phone wasn't in his hand. On Christmas eve of last year, her friend got in contact with me and told me that I shouldn't be friends with her, and that I needed to talk to both of them. He told me, after making me promise and swear that I wouldn't leave him, that he slept with her once, hopped up on a bunch of drugs. I wanted to leave, but the fact that it was Christmas and our families expected us to be happy together, I put on a face like nothing was actually wrong and stayed through the holiday season and that morphed into a long time after that.

There were a lot of dating sites and tinder contacts with other girls over that three year span after our first year together, that I just let go after trying to fight for the truth because I knew I'd never get it, and wouldn't ever be able to leave. I stopped fighting back after being kicked out of his car on the highway after confronting him when one of my friends reached out to me about finding one of his dating profiles. I've forced a lot of stuff out of my memory because I spent so long being downright miserable.

Don't get me wrong, I started a lot of arguments because I'd bring stuff up from the past, but I've come to learn that the stuff that was ""in the past"" was never actually in the past, and was continuously happening which is why he made it into a bigger deal than it actually was. 

I had an internship this summer where I became very close to two of my coworkers, who began to see how controlling and toxic the relationship was, the more I talked about it with them. One night, I had a drunken heart to heart with one of my friends (the other had long passed out) and it was at that point I realized that no matter what- I needed to leave. 

Dan lied to me about getting kicked out of school for his grades (this was the second or third time it's happened, also. He changed his major from engineering to history and spent the four years of his college career lying to his parents about how well his engineering courses were going- the first time they were going to find out about his major change, in his perfectly planned out world, would have been at commencement, where I would have taken the heat and been there with his parents when they found out). There was nothing in my mind that could allow me to logically stay with this kid anymore. I had finally had enough, and with the support of my two friends, ended the relationship shortly before our 4 year anniversary.

Dan went absolutely psychotic. He would text me and call me non-stop. Beg for me, he'd drive to my house 20 minutes away and wait for me to come home from work (I started staying with my friends or bringing them home with me so I wouldn't be going home alone). He tried to turn my best friend, who was spending time with him during the week at school, against me by dragging stuff up that happened two years ago. Dan threatened suicide, on so many occasions. I had to tell his parents that we broke up, because he refused to believe it was over.

He ran to my house at midnight, and sent me a text message of my mailboxes along with a map of his run. Our houses are 10+ miles apart, one way, and I live in a rural area with no street lights or stoplights. 

In hindsight I probably should have gotten a restraining order. He was downright nasty to me, whenever I'd reject him again. I was being slandered on social media constantly. He self harmed, and showed all his friends and told them I made him do it.

About a week after I ended the relationship, I get a text from my best friend who had been trying to distract him, with a picture of an engagement ring, which he was apparently going to propose with on our 4 year anniversary. I freaked out but my coworkers calmed me down and helped me to forget about it.

Fast forward a little. Because of how he was acting, my mom volunteered to get all of the things of mine he still had, for me, so I wouldn't be in danger. She met up with him, got a crate filled with my stuff back, and left it in the trunk of her car for me to grab at a later date.

Dan is currently dating a girl I went to high school with. They've posted all over social media about how happy they are, the fact that they're in ""unconditional love"", and both have since posted things directed at me, and the state of my mental health, and how horrible of a person I am, etc etc. They've been together for about a month now, and have known each other for slightly longer. 

He bought her tickets as a birthday gift to a concert he was well aware I was going to, 5 states away from our home state. Things like that, which still make my skin crawl- he's blocked on all of my social media sites and everything so he has no way of contacting me.

Fast forward to today- I finally got around to getting my stuff from him out of the trunk of my mom's car, and hidden in the sleeve of a sweatshirt he gave back to me, is the engagement ring.

What do I do with it?
He's made it very clear that he thinks horribly of me, and is happy with his new girlfriend (I'm also very happy with where I'm at)
Do I unblock him to try and give it back? Or get in contact with one of his parents to give it back? Or do I pawn/sell it?

Help.

TLDR; I broke up with my extremely unfaithful ex of 4 years shortly before he planned to propose to me. He went psycho after our breakup, and amid the things of mine he gave back to me, he hid the engagement ring. Didn't discover it until today, 6 months later."

I'm on a sort of internship program, i'll be working but not paid for it. I have a placement at a computer repair/retail outlet sort of place where i'll be working in the back fixing shit people bring in, with the possibility of a full time job if all goes well, and i'm going for a meet and greet there tomorrow. All good and well so far...

The probelm here is the guy who deals with placements has apparently talked me up quite a lot and i'm worried he has gone too far with it and the guy i'm going to see is expecting some sort of 'computer jesus', like i can walk in there and every broken system in the place will miraculously fix itself.

I asked for a placement in the IT sector, we talked about it for a bit, i'm good with computers, i can build them and diagnose any problems, i can install software, OS's or whatever but i don't know what to expect at this place, i don't what the 'employer' is expecting because i don't what the placement officer said to him. I have no formal qualifications, i'm completely self taught, been doing it for about a decade now but i'm still worried about what these people are expecting and what i'm going to be doing...

P.S. Sorry if i'm not making much sense, this has gotten me quite worked up as i cannot afford to lose this opportunity.

EDIT: Update: I got the position no problem. I guess i worried and lost sleep for nothing, oh well. Along side this position i have the opportunity to get accreditation from a few places, including Microsoft(!!) and Cisco. Methinks i will be taking full advantage of that. Otherwise all is normal and i start tomorrow.

I was recently offered a summer intern position at Dynetics as an Engineering Trainee. I was wondering what you guys have heard about this company and if there's anything I should be looking out for. I've done a little a research and looks like Huntsville is a pretty techy place. 

Another question I had is what kind of town is Hunstville? What should I be expecting as a 19 year old engineering student? My hometown is St. Louis, Missouri if that helps. I go to a small college in the middle of nowhere so I'm used to being on my own for entertainment and activities. 

Thanks guys!"

3wxqd3,2,2015-12-15,Question: Is it possible to work with Javascript in Excel to build an add-in?,kruppy,javascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3wxqd3/question_is_it_possible_to_work_with_javascript/,"Hey guys, im currently working with excel during an internship. To make life easier I want to work to build a small add-in to display Information in the worksheet and run simple test.



I found the office.js Framework from Microsoft to work in Office-Documents but haven't found a solution to display Information regarding the file (e.g. if cell A1 ==""Factory A"") then the add-in should display a window showing Text (Information about the Factory for example).


Another question is that the add-in should open a form and save the input for later usage.

Is it possible to do that things?

TL;DR: Can I display an interactive window in Excel.

Thank you!"

So far I was looking into several web frameworks and after seeing the lecture of Ryan Dahl [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqlZD21DME0) and having more experience in it I'm more inclined to pick node for the development of both projects.

Upon further investigation, I was reading about creating cluster of servers and mixing databases but I haven't found much that can give me a clear view of what are the purpose of that.

Am I on the right track by thinking that node is a good option or my lack of experience is clouding my judgement?

3wyvv4,1,2015-12-15,Will learning Node/Express be a worthwhile investment en route to learning React?,itelbg,javascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3wyvv4/will_learning_nodeexpress_be_a_worthwhile/,"Due to the scarcity of resources on ReactJS (which includes lack of resources on best practices, design patterns, writing scalable code, maintainable code, secure code, etc) and its ever-changing ecosystem... would it be wiser to build foundational skills with more established tools (or foundational skills in general, like functional JS with books like Javascript Allonge) and wait until the storm calms down a bit?

This is coming from the perspective of a beginner (I understand the basics like how the MVC/MVT model conceptually works, GET/POST, how a database works... have built a simple Python web app, and did a multi-threaded socket project in C for a school project).  It seems like the front-end world is moving too fast, and it's very intimidating.

I considered picking up a small framework like Flask, but figured Node/Express was the better investment because it's also lightweight and more importantly it's Javascript, so I will still be crafting my Javascript thinking/coding.  Plus, it's widely used in industry.

I figured picking up a small client-side JS framework like Backbone would have lesser return on investment than Node/Express since the Backbone paradigm may be too different from React, while the back-end is the back-end and one would need to learn it anyway (and again, Node is strong in the job market).  Is my thinking here correct?

I will at least finish working through the Full-Stack Redux Tutorial and then gauge how enthusiastic I am with wanting to stick to learning React, but I would like to hear some advice from more experienced developers who have used React, who can try to empathize with someone diving into a crazy world (the front-end) who still feels like he/she needs to build up on the basics before messing with an ever-changing sea of tools and ways of doing things.

What would you do in my position? Is it ok to play with React so long as I am constantly building my vanillaJS (I hear React helps that anyway), or would I be better spending my time learning more stable/established technology where I can focus on writing good code?  Is React really small enough that I'll be ok diving in?  Is it a skill/learning experience in itself stringing together constantly changing technology?

I am also looking at internships and there is almost nothing for React despite its fast-growing adoption rate.  Most intern positions are heavily in the back-end, and if they are not, they are either Angular or older jQuery intensive front-end positions, so this has made me reconsider diving into React when I could more quickly secure an internship learning something else first.

Appreciate any insight!"

After this Friday, I'll have about 3 weeks off before the next semester starts in January.

Until classes start again, I'll be spending pretty much everyday alone. My roommates, one being my cousin and the other being my SO, have left to go back home for the break. Granted my SO is from Chicago, and has been living out of state for her internship for this semester, but she doesn't plan to come officially move in until next semester. 

My cousin was always the quiet one and spent practically every day in her room, only coming out for food. So even when she lived here, I would still come home and sit in silence all evening in a seemingly empty apartment. 

The rest of our friend group, all guys, are in the same frat, and I have only seen them a handful of times all semester. And when I have seen them, all they talk about is drinking and partying and frat activities. We had all originally planned to get a house together next fall, but the three fratties just blew that away because they want a party house instead. 

I do plan to go home for Christmas and New Year's, but even then, I'll only be able to see my family. I have no friends back at home I can visit or hang out with. Until then, every day is just another day of coming home to a dreary apartment, and sit alone watching tv, sleeping, eating.

This probably sounds really long, and whiny, and moany, but I have just never been in a situation where I have felt I have no friends, or anyone, to see or be with. I hate coming home alone, sitting alone, not speaking, staring blearly at my computer or tv. I have never felt this lonely before, and I am just not sure what to do about anything."

3wzq74,3,2015-12-15,"Want to work / study STEM in a non English speaking country, not sure where to start",11_inches_of_justice,studyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/3wzq74/want_to_work_study_stem_in_a_non_english_speaking/,"To give a very brief summary of a very long reasoning, I worked road construction two summers ago with some of the nicest Hispanic guy's I've ever known, lived with a roommate from New Mexico, and briefly dated an Argentinian woman. All of these people helped me to better understand Hispanic culture and have given me what I call a ""Laughable white mans fluency in Spanish"". 

From all of these experiences, I really want to work / study abroad in a country where English isn't the primary language, and I don't really care which one it is. I studied French for 5 years in school, and have my passable Spanish fluency, so a Spanish speaking country would be preferred, but I just really would like to go abroad for at least a few months.


However my dilemma is that I am currently a Junior studying Physics and Computer Science in a 5 year master program, working at a particle physics lab. So I'd really like to just ""Go abroad"" for a semester, but my school doesn't offer any foreign travel (Besides English speaking Glasgow) that isn't entirely irrelevant to what I'm studying, and (In the most respectful way possible) I can't justify putting my schooling behind a semester just to run off and go learn Spanish.

Basically I'm hoping to find a ""Productive"" internship or study abroad program in another country that wouldn't just be me goofing off for a few months. I have no problem whatsoever attempting to learn a new language, but I know these things tend to be easier if some level of fluency is already apparent.

There's just a lot of information out there, and I really have no idea where to begin, and nobody I've talked to at my school has been very helpful. Any and all advice is definitely appreciated, and I'll gladly answer any questions for things I may have left out."
3wzy1j,30,2015-12-15,Taking Food Safety Practices Seriously,Throw_Away_Bad_Food,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3wzy1j/taking_food_safety_practices_seriously/,"I am posting here today because for a several months, I have felt really conflicted with feelings of disgust while working at my job, and I'm not sure what I should do.

I work at a major retail store. Like most retailers within the recent decade or so, this retailer has discovered that there is a market for opening up a grocery section of the store. I specifically specialize in the refrigerator and frozen areas.

The store I work brings in a lot of revenue; I guess we rank near the top in the US. We are always crowded with shoppers. Because of this, we end up getting a lot of product shipped in each night, but the store's design is flawed in that the focus of its construction was on floor space and the backroom is EXTREMELY limited, especially cooler and freezer sections.

What this means is that we get a ton of frozen and refrigerated product that sits out on a pallet, in room temperature, sometimes for hours. The overnight workers and managers also really don't give a fuck and with the occasional overnight shifts that I have picked up with them, I learned that they end up dividing all the boxes of product up to sit on the sales floor before unboxing the product. At least, this is an efficient system. But technically, we are supposed to trash the food as it thaws for more than 30 minutes, sometimes we go casually over at an hour... but I know for a fact that food thaws and they just sell it anyways.

Another problem is that our store is incredibly short-staffed, so there isn't enough people to work the product/manage the cooler and freezer storage, ect. While talking to management and a young intern who is my age, I've racked up different explanations of why that is. The highest of managers and the intern put the blame on corporate policy, like there is some maximum amount of hours we can have, but my direct supervisor always mentions how strict his boss is with the payroll, which makes me really suspicious that the store staffs way shorter than it needs to in order to preserve that high revenue and ranking.

This is so sketchy, and I can't imagine it is legal that they endure their costs in this way. It was obvious to me that the quality of the food would be poor (ice cream no longer is ice cream after a while), but last night, I stuck up for prioritizing food safety again (like I was trained to!) only to frustrate my managers. When I got home, I did a little bit of googling and read about foodbourne illness, and how bacteria can form and increase while that food is thawed. This made me nervous. I talked to someone who works low level customer service in the store about this, and she thinks someone should report them. Some co-workers in my department, meanwhile, deny that its any big deal. They specifically mention that the frozen food will hold better while its still all condensed on a pallet.

If someone reads this, what do you think? I have thought about resigning to not be apart of it, I have tried transfering but that takes a while and has been a very political process since I have learned that the grocery managers figure it to be easier to keep me locked in grocery instead of hiring someone new. I'd prefer though, that I don't quit... mostly because I'm studying computer science which gives me potential to get a great job higher up, where I can pay off my over $100k in student loans. They also have a lot of other great benefits, like tuition coverage if I wanted to continue education with a new degree or grad school.

I'm morally opposed and disappointed that the store does this, and yet, it sort of seems like the economics/available space ect. sort of puts the managers in a place to make hard choices. Does anyone have ideas of what I should do?

**EDIT:** I've already made steps in the past to speak with human resources, and also the Food Safety manager."

I'd like your thoughts on this, please!


My ex and I got together at a bad time in both of our lives - really bad times. I was struggling with depression (and was not aware), lost my best friend, did badly in school, and just enlisted in the military - which is mandatory in my country. She, on the other hand, just witnessed her parents divorce and quickly became anorexic and severely underweight.


I was very obsessive (and still a little bit so). Not to the point of it being a mental problem, but enough that I would get very frustrated with things very quickly. I was prone to outbursts of anger and violence, although I have **never actually hit a person, only objects**. It quickly became the case that she would be the only one who could get me to calm down when I exploded.


Similarly, she felt like she could only felt that she could eat somewhat normally when she went out with me because I took her mind off of the food; when she did have an episode and start to freak out, I would be the only one who could talk her down.


I told her that being firm with me wouldn't work, because it always fed my outburst, and that the only way to deal with me was to wait it out. In regard to my depression, she would always comfort me and talk to me at length about how I should take my time with recovery; she would say that I could be lazy if I wanted to be as long as I got better eventually.


The both of us have recovered a great deal. I'm (finally) in college abroad, just finished my first semester. I almost never explode now, and I generally feel happier and more energetic than I used to, even after weaning off my depression meds. She's now a healthy weight, finishing her final year of college and occupying herself with all sorts of work and internships.

*EDIT: I'd like to make it clear that we recovered over the course of 3 years, not just in the few months after we broke up. Also it's been 4 months, not 5. I'm bad at counting.*


We both started to realise that I was tying her down a little with the issue of my mental stability, while the way we dealt with it wasn't the best for me, either. We broke up shortly after I left for college, overseas, as a result. It was very amicable - we're still good friends, we still talk. Occasionally we admit that we still love each other, to some extent.


We joked throughout our relationship that her coddling only enabled my bad behaviour, which in hindsight is a little bit true. However, I'm also positive that if we did not find each other when we did, our recoveries would not have been so swift, if at all. I'm absolutely sure that I loved her, and that we had something real and wonderful, even if a little bit unhealthy.


It's been a semester, and everything's going well. Turns out I can take care of myself, I'm doing very well in school and I haven't yet killed myself! Hurray.


She, too, feels like the breakup was good for the both of us.


Whenever I meet new people here, they ask me if I want to stay in this country after I graduate. I always reply with ""it depends"". The truth is, though, that I want to be wherever she is. I'm still in love with her, and I've told her this. She's receptive to getting back together.


However, knowing that she did have a slight tendency for enabling my bad habits - is this a good idea? At all? We've both changed in a few months. I'm a lot more stable, I feel more confident; she feels more autonomous now that her life isn't tied to mine. Being fully aware of the parts of our relationship that weren't so great, would getting back together undo all of this?

   
**tl;dr**: Broke up with girlfriend after moving overseas for college because our relationship was not completely healthy. Several months later, we're both doing great. It was a wonderful relationship, but we both acknowledge the problems we had in the past; knowing this, would getting back together be a good idea?"
3x038j,6,2015-12-15,New area of the facility discovered.,TheHornyToothbrush,SecretSubreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecretSubreddit/comments/3x038j/new_area_of_the_facility_discovered/,"I was walking around sector K and when I tipped a vending machine over(It ate my quarter) I uncovered a hatch.



  The hatch had been bolted shut heavily all around. Luckily for me, my gauntlet has a bolt cutter attachment. So after clamping through the bolts I lifted up the hatch and climbed down. 



  When I got down I was greeted with almost complete darkness. I pulled out my lighter which illuminated the place surprisingly well. 



  I then realized I was in another floor of the facility. It looked just like any other average floor. It had vending machines, offices, desks, lights, and your average facility stuff. Except for one thing.



  This floor looked like it hadn't been inhabited for decades. The lights were falling out of the ceiling. Everything was either cracked or broken. Vending machines sat idle. Desk plants grew to mammoth proportions, engulfing the furniture around them. But that's not the worst part. 



  Rotting bodies of Interns were all around. Most looked like they'd been eaten by vent tigers. At least I hope it was vent tigers. 



  As I explored further I came across files, weapons and other projects that couldn't have been from any of our departments. The files talked of things I had no recollection about, nor could I remember any details about them in the archives. 



  But the whole place gave off a strange feeling of déjà vu. In fact it was so intense that I had bits and peices of flashbacks,  flashbacks of things I've never seen, and not all of them were mine, I saw some from other facility members too. 



  As I was walking back to the hatch, I was frozen in my tracks. Suddenly the area of hall in front of me, no longer seemed deserted, it was as lively as ever. I saw /u/petrilstatusfull walk out of a room and pour herself some coffee. I would've said hi if it weren't for the horrifying thing that I saw next. 

  A man walked out of the room, and began talking with /u/petrilstatusfull but the man....was me. But it wasn't me, it couldn't have been. I was still frozen,  when the vision dissapeared and I was left standing once again in the deserted hallway.

   When my eyes came to rest on something that struck me cold. Standing not 3 feet in front of me was, white, inhuman, it could be described as a wraith, it was ghostly...it was evil. 



  Without thinking I ran through the figure, sprinting towards the hatch. As I reached the hatch and began to climb I tensed up, I could swear they almost got me, but I didn't stay around to check. 



  As I climbed out of the hatch, I slammed it behind me. And with inhuman strength I heaved the vending machine over the hatch. And fell back and on the ground waiting for anything to happen. 

***



  I don't what I saw. Or where that place was. But I'm going to get to the bottom of it. If you need me I'll be in my office looking over the archives.

  Until further notice, no one, and I mean no one is to go down there. Not until I know more about this. I'll have Donahue guarding the entrence. Not only to keep you out, but to keep them in. *feels around coat for cigar*

I'm a lurker, but I'm at my wit's end right now and need some advice if possible. My father is bipolar and extremely narcissistic. He refuses to learn how to do anything, and blames everyone when things do not get done. My mother is narcissistic as well and was physically, emotionally and verbally abusive throughout my childhood. I think she was angry and needed someone to take everything out on.

I have tried to kill myself twice; the last time was 3 years ago at the end of my first semester of college. I moved into my aunt and uncle's house. They live about 15 minutes from my college and 45 minutes from my parents. I go to my parents' almost every weekend, help them out, and try to do the best I can. Since my last attempt, I have kicked myself into shape, gotten into hardcore therapy, done many really great internships and am applying to law school. My plan was always to go work on political campaigns starting this January as I'm about to graduate.

I have gotten a job offer across the country. It pays great, housing is included, and it really is perfect. I asked my mother's support in this endeavor, which she agreed to, but has now begun to make things difficult. It started with my car, which we both pay for. She doesn't want me driving it across the country, she wants to ship it. She thinks it'll be cold (duh, anywhere but my state is going to be cold). She doesn't know the people I'll be living with (heaven forbid they not be Indian). She then thinks I'm going to start drinking, something's she's adamantly against despite the fact that I'm 21 (and drink anyway), but she's laying the guilt trip on hard. I just need to make sure I get out, and I don't know how to ensure that. I guess I'm nervous, but I don't know how to hold my ground on this. How do I get out?"

Have never used one before!,r_rowen,chromeos,https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/3x0zon/would_a_chromebook_be_right_for_me_have_never/,"Hi all, thanks for helping me out with this question! I've been looking at Chromebooks for a few months now and they are seeming like a great choice for me. I have a 13 inch macbook air currently. It's getting older and needs a new battery and charger most likely, things I need to save up for. I mainly use it for typing papers, facebook, youtube, gmail, and my university log in (D2L/blackboard). I don't use programs like photoshop, do editing, or download games. My major is Criminal Justice with a Psych minor and there aren't any specific programs required for students, just a lot of research and assignments.
I am thinking of getting a 13 inch Toshiba Chromebook 2 and using it to get me through my internship and my last few classes of college before I graduate. Also, many of my upcoming classes are going to be online. I'm planning to leave my mac at home and take the Chromebook to campus and class for notes. I'm thinking I can still use my mac if something can't be done on the Chromebook. For the type of student I am, would a Chromebook work for me? Thanks!!"

Please help my daughter find the Science toys she wants so badly.",leredditmann,RandomActsOfChristmas,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/3x16qc/dear_santa_i_have_been_laid_off_all_gifts_were/,"During my Junior year of high school I became pregnant with my oldest daughter Nicky. She changed everything, my grades improved as sharply as my work ethic. I was kicked out of my home by my mother, but this didn't slow me down. I worked my way through the University of Florida and received a degree in Engineering in 2008. After an internship I was hired by a very large company that I cannot mention and was very happy there. I met the most wonderful man i the world soon after and we had another daughter, Sadie in June. We scrimpted and saved and paided back every dime of student debt I had. Nicky has never once asked for anything because she knows we will be out of debt soon and she sees us working so hard. In June I paided my final payment, and I asked Nicky what she wanted. She said, ""Nothing Mommy, Sadie is all I want."" My husband is a stay at home dad so he did some digging and found out that she wants a Microscope, and a telescope so she can do science with Mommy. She said she wants to be an engineer like me. I'm so proud of her, she's so smart. I got laid off at the beginning of December very unexpectedly, right as everything was coming together. But, thankfully my baby got her Telescope and her Microscope. We hid them at a friends storage space, in her condo building. The loss of my job has been devistating to us financially and my husband has been driving for Uber on the weekends, and I have been on a nonstop job hunt. The worst and most demoralizing thing is that all of Nicky's toys are gone, the fire department said someone had thrown a cigarette down the laundry chute. Everything in the basement burned, there was a sprinkler malfunction. Thankfully no one was hurt and the building is fine. Here we are, I don't ask for help I don't need and I desperately want to provide gifts for daughter. I cannot, and I beg you please help. She's so special and she's been so patient with everything. All the years of paying my bills so we could have a better life. All she want is to do science. Thank you so much for reading and I hope all of you have a Merry Christmas or Happy Hanukkah, whatever makes you happy. Be the change you want to see in the world.

3x1bnq,1,2015-12-15,27M4F Up for (almost!) anything,redditbadboy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3x1bnq/27m4f_up_for_almost_anything/,"As the title implies, I'm up for pretty much anything tonight. That encompasses dirty talk, RP'ing, or any other kind of back-and-forth you can imagine. As long as it doesn't fit into my no-goes list, which is down below, I'm game.

Long story short, I'm a giver. When a woman I'm going back and forth with enjoys herself and gets off, it turns me on. As such, I'm looking to give tonight, and I'm interested to see where that takes me.

If you're just looking for dirty chat, fire away with a naughty orange envelope and let's get started. If you're looking to RP, I've got a few sample prompts below as starting points, but I'm willing to consider a lot.

1) I'm a bachelor who's just moved into town. I don't know anything or anyone, and as my neighbor, you're the first person I meet. It just so happens that you're gorgeous, and whether you're a sexy college coed or a MILF, the possibilities abound.

2) I'm a mid-level boss in an office, and you're an intern. I make some money on the side doing video editing work, and in doing some duties for a shady client, I notice a very familiar face grinding a pole and on the laps of several strip club visitors: You. I wait until everyone else goes home to present the evidence.

3) Your basic party scene; can be any kind of party (nightclub, pool party, strip club, etc.).

4) I've married an older woman, and we've decided on an open relationship. She's got a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. Her mother thinks you're an awful influence, but I look beyond the rebellious streak and see a young body built for sex.

5) Anything you can think of that doesn't go into my limits; get creative!

That aforementioned list of limits: Animals/furries/non-humans, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, noncon, extreme age play.

Hope to hear from you ladies tonight!"
3x1dtn,2,2015-12-15,"Me [20M] and my loving girlfirend [20F] have been dating for over 5 years, but I'm over it",bulldogsportsfan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3x1dtn/me_20m_and_my_loving_girlfirend_20f_have_been/,"So a little backstory to begin. I'm a college student and ive been dating my current GF for a little over 5 years. We began dating sophomore year of HS and were able to go the the same college since both of us got favorable offers. The first couple years of our relationship in HS were great, I was really in love with her and enjoyed being around her. We did thoughtful things for eachother and I was very proud of her (she is a 4.0 student and also runs track here at our college). She is the only serious girlfriend I have EVER had. She is pretty great to me, always texting me about my day and genuinely interested in what I do. She supports me and we rarely fight. She never is abusive to me in any way, she is such a sweetheart and always wants to do things for me.

Once I got to college though, things began changing. I noticed i almost always preffered hanging with friends (even those i didnt know too well) instead of her. I began feeling like we never had anything to do, and that all we ever did was watch movies or go out to eat together. I brought it up to her my Freshman year, and we talked and decided to try and fix it.

Things didnt necessarily get better, but we continued to date. We spent the next 2 summers away from eachother, since she stayed in our college town for internships and i went back to our hometown. I noticed that i really enjoyed this time away from her. I could finally focus on what i wanted to do while only having to text her a few times a day. 

Now here i am in my Junior year. Over this past summer i was almost sure that we wouldnt work out. Mostly just compatibility things; i love music while she doesnt care for it much, i love deep convos about space &amp; existence but she usually just says ""yeah"" or ""thats cool"". I've always thought that the ONE would be like my best friend, someone who I didnt need to do fun things with to have a good time. Someone who i could just talk to for hours.

Anyway, I decided that maybe it was just the distance that was making me feel this way, so I would give a more time before i broke it off. The beginning of the semester was fine, but soon I began feeling different.

Whenever she texts me I am almost instantly annoyed. I will lie to her to avoid hanging out. I put off texting her back for as long as I can just so I don't have to hang with her. When we do get around to spending time together, all i can think about is my exit strategy and what i want to do next. She always lays her stress on me, and more than ever i question what I am even getting out of the relationship. It feels like she is dragging me around to do things she wants and to make herself feel better. Our sex life was never spectacular, but that has also fallen off a bit; i dont even crave it with her much these days.

Besides going on hikes, I cant think of anything we really enjoy doing together. We both have similar values and goals, like travelling the world. I feel we will both have successful futures and if i stay with her, I know that i will have a decent life with someone who deeply cares for me. I'm her best friend, the one she always goes to first, and she would do anything for me. I dont feel the same way about her, though. In fact I can list off 10-15 friends i'd rather be with than her. It seems like I have 2 personalities: who i am and who i pretend to be when i'm around her. It's not like i act totally different, but I feel like i have to hold back. I dont really have that much fun with her, she is a bit boring 

So, I told her all of these feelings. I wanted to take a break to try and find myself and what i wanted. Being the age i am (20), I'm in this period where im really looking for myself. Who I want to be, where i want to take my life, etc. And i feel like she is holding me back. I cant decide what is truly best for me as long as I'm with her since i have to take her into consideration. It also eats me alive that she is the only one I've ever been with. It makes me think to myself, ""how do i know what i want in a relationship if i only have been in one?"". I also feel its unfair to her; she is giving me her unconditional love while i just half ass everything and go through the motions.

After i told her a couple months back I wanted to break up, she convinced me that we should try. And I agreed, i felt that if I had been with her this long, it wasnt worth it to throw it all away just because maybe i was having a bad month. She also took all of the blame; she believes that this whole situation is her fault, since she hasnt been giving me enough attention. I completely disagree with this, and like i said earlier feel like she is a great girlfriend to me. So we texted more, saw eachother more, and everything seemed OK again. But soon enough I began feeling the way I do now once again.

I dont feel love for her like I once did. Dont get me wrong, I love her as a person. I dont respect many people as much as i do her (as I mentioned, she is a 4.0 engineering student who also is excelling in collegiate track). On paper, she fits probably 90% of my qualifications for a girl. And i think that is what has kept me around so long; the fear that I would be letting go such a great person who would always be loyal and loving to me. I fear that I may never find someone like her again.

But I cant fight the feeling that she isnt the one for me. I miss the feeling of love. Wanting to always be around her, thinking of her, wanting to do things for her. If it was my choice, we would almost never hang out. I never seem to want to be around her, and these days when i am little things about her peeve me more than ever. I crave freedom from a relationship, it all just seems like a hassle to me these days. I'm excited about almost everything in my life except our relationship. Its the one thing in my life that consistently brings me down and makes me feel less happy. And i find myself looking at and flirting with other girls more than ever.

During these past few months I've done a lot of searching on the internet. Almost everyone says that all relationships hit this stage at some point, when you realize they are just as human as you are and you feel a bit bored. But i dont see myself suddenly having a change of heart. I try to remind myself why i fell for her by thinking of all the things that make her great. But my heart just isnt in it anymore, and I don't love her like i once did.

So now here I am on Reddit, after a friend recommended it to me (If youre reading this, thanks Cal). My question for all of you is: Whats up with me? Are these all signs that she isnt the one for me and i should move on? Or am I just bored and blinding myself to all the reasons she is great? I keep going back and forth about whether or not i should end it with her. 

I always thought that when i found the one, I would just know. There would be absolutely no doubt in my mind that i want to spend the rest of my life with that person. How did you all know when you found ""the one""?



   
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend of over 5 years is great, but I simply dont feel like I love her anymore and the relationship is the only thing in my life bringing me down."
3x1jwj,0,2015-12-16,(21/f) I'm getting really annoyed with literally everything my boyfriend (27/m) does. Literally everything.,KittyLord0824,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3x1jwj/21f_im_getting_really_annoyed_with_literally/,"We've been together for a little over two years, been living together for 10 months. We've been together through the loss of a baby, a literal gang rape, long distance, etc. I was so deeply in love with him even when all that was happening. I couldn't wait to see him on skype every night for hours and hours, and was more than willing to spend hundreds of dollars on VIA train tickets for the year we were long distance, sometimes opting to pay for a first class seat if all the economy class seats were taken, instead of waiting 'til the next day. However, since we started living together, I just want to bite his head off half the time and I have like -10 sex drive.

Take 30 minutes ago, for example. He just came home from work. I'm trying to study for a psychology exam tomorrow morning. He jumped up on the bed and rubbed his face in my back, trying to be cute I guess, and all I could do was turn and give him a quick smile because if I let myself do anything else, I would have wound up saying ""can you fucking stop? You're not a cat."" He said he loved me, I said I loved him too. The movie I had to watch for class cut to commercial, I said ""you should go get some dinner for yourself, this is just going to be ads for a few minutes"". He said ""yeah, I will. Are you mad at me?"" I told him no I was just tired and had had a long day. He then says ""Are you sure you're not mad at me?"" Well now I fucking am! Of course, I don't say that though. Of course, I said no. He got up and, once at the bedroom door, in his sappiest voice goes ""I really do love you, you know"" and all I could bring myself to do was laugh/scoff, raise my eyebrows, nod, and say ""yeah, I know"".

I get so annoyed with hearing this incredibly sappy bullshit ALL the time. Like, he tells me he loves me 15 times a day. I'm told I'm ""(his) everything"" at least once every other day, along with ""if I didn't have you my life would be horrible,"" ""I don't want to think of what life would be like without you,"" ""you're my world,"" ""I can't wait to marry you,"" ""[insert something about our future children/marriage],"" ""I missed you so much today, did you miss me?"". I get annoyed at all of them. I feel trapped. About 75% of my heart already has one foot out the door of this relationship but the other 25% is staying and I honestly don't even think it's out of love but I don't flinch when I tell him I love him. Does that mean I'm lying but don't want to admit it to myself? Does that mean I really love him but the love doesn't outweigh the negatives of the relationship?

I understand that I have my own flaws as a partner. I'm not intimate often enough, but that's partially because I'm fucking depressed and stressed all the time, I never get enough sleep (he practically knees me out of bed every night), he never lets me know that he finds me sexually appealing unless I ask if he does, and I kind of mother him and he totally lets me and (let's be real) nobody with a healthy mind wants to sleep with someone who they half-view as a child they have to take care of. I understand I can be a bit controlling with my money and I try to control his too, but that's because I'm literally out of money for the rest of the month already because I spend it literally all on groceries and other necessities, I can show you my bills if you don't believe me, (I don't even have money to buy simple christmas gifts for my family) and he's fucking acting like it's the end of the world when I ask for grocery money, despite the fact that he doesn't pay off his debts, he doesn't pay for school, he doesn't pay for a phone bill (because he fucking uses my phone that my mom has to pay for because I can't afford to pay it myself, he got kicked off his phone plan for racking up debts), all he does is pay his portion of rent and utilities and some groceries if I beg him to do it. It's not that I want to control him or his money, I just want him to help me out financially. He's stolen money from me once before for cigarettes, and taken huge chunks of money from his portion of savings for first/last on the apartment we're supposed to start renting in two months. All he ever does is talk about paintball, or bitch about our roommates, or bitch about work. Everything is always someone else's fault. He can't even commit to doing something small, like throwing out a goddamn bedbug-ridden comforter and pillow despite the fact that I'm beyond allergic to those bugs! He refuses to stand up for himself to friends, work, anything, but then turns around and bitches about how he gets treated. I make dinner for us, and good dinners too, every single night but apparently that doesn't count as contributing to housework?  I've gotten so sick of the lack of thanks I get for putting in an hour of my time into the kitchen, I've just stopped making meals for two if he's at work later than 8:30 (I used to make a good meal and save his portion for when he got home, reheat it for him, sit with him, try to get him to talk about his day or anything at all for that matter). He doesn't seem to understand nonverbal communication. Like... at all. I understand women are naturally more in tune with that, but last night I asked him to pass me (MY) grey pillow from HIS side of the bed, because apparently he needs three pillows and I only need one or whatever the reason was that he took it, and he was like ""yeah sure"" but then he let out this exasperated sigh and basically slammed the pillow against my stomach. I was like ""Um... what's up your butt?"" and he was totally clueless as to what he did.

I get annoyed when he says he loves me too much or makes sappy comments. I get annoyed when I come home from my internship and he's been home all day and nothing's been done and he's napping. I get annoyed when he naps in general (that might be jealousy, I can't sleep during the day). I get annoyed when he says things in baby-speak (ex. my mom and I have always jokingly called wet cat food ""stinky food"", he heard us say that one night and now he always calls it ""stinkies""). I get annoyed when he talks too much at night and he knows I have to be up in the morning. I get annoyed when he talks too loud. I get annoyed when he finally initiates intimacy but goes straight to touching my lady bits and/or just starts kissing me really hard and then immediately trying to fuck. I get annoyed when he whines about a mess but then refuses to clean it up. I get annoyed when he whines about a pain but refuses to go to the doctor (despite this pain being a constant thing since the day I met him). I get annoyed when he tries to correct me to say ""our cat"" when I say ""my cat"" (oh... our cat? The one I pay every vet bill for? The one I've spent $600 on in he past 4 months for vet bills and medication? The one I buy 9/10 food bags for? The one I brush daily? The one that I saw at the shelter and demanded to get ""that cat"" instead of any gifts on my 16th birthday? The one I've had for 5 years and you've been living with for 10 months? That cat?). I get annoyed when he talks about marriage. I get annoyed when he talks about our future kids. It's gotten to the point where I can hear someone coming up the stairs and I hope it's not him.

Sorry, I know it sounds like I'm venting and in a way I sort of am, but I want you guys to see into my head. Am I crazy? Am I some coldhearted emotionless bitch? Is he actually fucking annoying? I don't even know what to think. I was raised by a very strong single mother, I kind of wonder if that has something to do with being annoyed by the very needy things he says (ex. ""you're my everything"" I was taught to always be my own everything and allow other people to become a part of it but never become all of it)? I don't even know what to do, guys.. help....

**TL;DR- everything boyfriend says or does pisses me off. I feel he's very immature when it comes to spending and when it comes to his nonverbal communication. I am frustrated with his sort of victim-identity. I can't even stand to hear the sappy lines that he says every damn day. I'm annoyed by ""I love you""s and often fantasize about living just me and my cat in a 1 bedroom apartment. I don't know what's going on with me though because, when I do say that I love him, I don't feel doubt or that I'm lying. Help!!!**"
3x1mv1,4,2015-12-16,Abusive relationships,vcardthrow1,ForeverAloneWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneWomen/comments/3x1mv1/abusive_relationships/,"eta: This is a rant. It is both a relationional post, and a rant. 

I think my mother is diagnosible for BPD and has been probably since I was 15. She says I've been a demon child that hated her since age 8, since I got close to my grade school teacher. I am asking if you folks relate, and going to tell you what's been torturing me for the last five years. I am trapped with this person financially because I live with my parents and as my mother and I get older, the abuse naturally gets worse/harder to take. 
------------------

I know I've written too much about her but I think the worst part of being FA is characterized by my relationship with my mother. 

No matter how ugly I felt, how depressed, how scary things were, how isolating acne or being a shitty student was, there is NOTHING, literally no problem so bad she couldn't make it worse. It's so bad getting it out in the world and coming home to a viper's nest. 

She's probably about as abusive as her own miserable, perpetually aggrieved, slightly mentally ill, manipulative, hysterical, sadistic Irish Catholic mother was. 

I spent my whole life doing whatever she asked and what it got me was being unemployed, the object of contempt--I am so fucking untouchable my friends could not help me find work if they wanted to--and my entire life is the sparse not-livable jobs I get babysitting and cleaning. 

I want to tell them what happened and they'd laugh at me. Or feel disgusted by me. They'd agree with her, they'd say, well your mother called a lazy dumb piece of shit when she saw it and picked the best solution.

And there are honestly some days I'm tired, or sick. Today it was an MRI, work and picking up work clothes. 

I think the best my life is will be with a horrible job, working 12 hours a day making $10/hour, dead on my feet, crying from exhaustion, no friends, no personal life, and whenever I am home, it'll just be her screaming at me, blaming me for being a ""feeb"", living with my fucking mother until she has to be put into a home and I will have to take care of this horrible old woman, but that's going to be the rest of my life--instead of living away from her or with a sibling because I can help pay rent, instead of distance--my whole life belongs to her. 

It is no longer affordable to live a decent commute from Manhattan, where most of the jobs are, unless you can pay 1,200/month and live with roommates.

I think I will die making less than 18,000. That's all she thought I was worth.

She takes the $200/month or so I earn from babysitting, even though she's retired and lives on my father's dime--a parasite, like me.

I feel like that's really who I am and who every one sees, and that pathetic piece of shit little overgrown baby that literally went to graduate school because my mother said I was too stupid to find a job so I might as well teach little kids (something I never wanted to do--she said I was a negative piece of shit who ""HATES EVERYTHING"", but that's not how someone looks for work)--I couldn't finish the graduate program and the state changed all my certification exams. I never really get away from her. Even as a solid adult--22, 23, 24, 25, 27--I made STUPID decisions and timed them out of fear. Leave the house without telling I'm going because she'll attack me when I leave and attack me when I can back,  yell, scream, demand my money, demand to know why I'm working without telling her when I leave, demand to know where I'm going--it is not to keep me safe. She wants to push me to find more babysitting work. 

I hate this work. Sometimes I leave the apartment to go sit in the park to be alone. Sometimes I go to the dermatologist--and it takes fucking two hours to see the c*nt doctor ten minutes. But it's time where she thinks I'm making her money. ""You're a loser. You're lazy. You contribute nothing. You're going to be a drag on your brothers.""

I am in part because I was stupid and chose history as a major and was too fucked in the head to know how to find an internship, but nobody warned me about resumes, interviews, or that leaving college without work experience would seal my fate so she could force me into something she thought low enough for me. 

From the time she wakes up in the morning till the time she goes to bed at night it's like nursing an ulcer being around her. 

My Dad went along with it--I'll admit it, I hate him for it. But a father shouldn't need to defend a kid from a mother. That's not normal. 

I usually think of the women here as accomplished or with decent relationships with their families, if no one else...but can anyone relate? 

That truly is the worst part of this--that...betrayal. It's tickle torture--being mocked, and humiliated, and invaded under my skin, into my brains and organs and memories. I've never masturbated because I can't lock a door to cry, jerk off, or do anything else. If I DID ever date a man I could never bring him home because with age she's become deeply religious and would use it as evidence I was a slut going to hell. 

If he hit me or raped me she'd both turn it into something that happened to HER, and proof I was both stupid and bad--as she's known her whole life. Deserving. 

Having the person that forced me into life....I feel like she's an angry, miserable witch who cursed me with the self-fulfilling prophecies not just of her ugly face, her acne, her own miserable adolescence and young adulthood--but failure. Everybody sees an miserable, stupid person, and I feel like one. I hate being around people; I'm emotionally and experientally half my age. 

She yelled and screamed at me today because I felt too tired and shitty to do the dishes and ripped out my laptop cord and threatened to hit me. I'm 29. 

I know I shouldn't be living here. I'm living here because my Dad lets me. She ruined my relationship with him too. 

I can honestly say I daydream about her dying of a heart attack or getting hit by a car like you dream about an abusive husband dying or a lifelong affliction finally being cured. I would still be a piece of trash, ugly, acne-ridden, plagued with chronic fatigue and pain, and illness--but I would get to define my days, my moods. It would be quiet in this apartment.

I would take care of my dad until he died, and my brother. And we'd live in relative peace. 

Can anyone relate? I think of being FA as a host of things--lack of love and the sense one is unlovable, despite the human being you try to be on your good days, being too ""ugly"", too weird, too mentally ill for the normal things that make being alive worth living, like the experience of having loved returned; lack of companionship or worth to others; inability to feel pretty or valued as a result; socially and romantically isolated; and on some level, unable to control one's own happiness. Relationship-ineffectual.

But this--this drove a lot of it. Bad genes, inheriting her repulsive, manly face, and having this as the woman in my life. There is no trial too big that she can't pour on bitterness--and it has always been this way.

If someone asked me what sentiment I'd use to describe our dynamic, it would be perpetual humiliation and coercion. I would be a fucking 25 year old coerced like a bad, stupid 10 year old being punished. 

Can anyone relate at all, with an abusive father, mother, relationship or family?

She abused my father, wailing and screaming, a little angry baby in an old crone's body. That's who she is as a mother, and that's their marriage. 

My wish that she would die gets worse with each fight, and as the realization I am never going to be able to afford to get away from her for good grows. 

I'm sorry and I know it's ugly but really--it makes suicide look like unlocking bloody, rusty chains. Relief from being burnt and eaten alive.

I lost a part of myself during our seven years together. I lost my spark, my spunk, my self respect, and my self esteem. You've made me feel ugly, prude, old, ashamed, worthless, psychotic. You made me feel all these terrible adjectives that linger in the back of my mind and only show their face when I feel confident again. You made me feel all these terrible things, but my heart still holds on to the late night dances in the parking lots, the early morning cuddles, and the thrill of being young and in love. 

I hate that I carry war wounds from this relationship, and you just get that ""Hey. I cheated and feel really bad about it so it'll never happen again"" disclaimer.  I hate that your excuses were that I was never there (I lived two floors below you), that I worked too much, went to too many meetings, participated in too many long-distance internships. Fuck you for telling me that this was my fault. Fuck you for telling me that a penis isn't personal.

I hate that every time I mentioned grad school, graduation, life- you told me to not worry and we could figure it out, BUT WE NEVER DID. I hate that you told me that I should have just brought it up again, or planned it out myself. I hate that I let you hold me back. I hate that I waited for you. 

I hate that when you noticed you were going to lose me,  when I was finally done waiting, you tried to put effort into the relationship.

I hate that you never wanted me. I hate that I always wonder why I wasn't good enough, pretty enough, sexy enough, friendly enough? I hate the fact that you are my person. 

I hate that every time I try to pull myself up by the bootstraps and move forward, you choose that moment to message me and bring me back to the floor. 

I'm done. I'm over the Facebook posts, the snaps, the texts, the steam messages, and the calls. I am done allowing you to bring me down. I am done making excuses for you as a friend, a boyfriend, and everything in between. I deserve more, I always have. 

You were a shitty first love, John, but I am not going to allow you to be my only love..

Fuck you.

I have a Bachelor's degree in neuroscience (subjects ranging from behavioral psychology to molecular biology) and will finish a 2-year Master's degree in molecular neuroscience (consisting mostly of internships) next summer. I'd like to work at the interface between neuroscience and artificial intelligence, but am having a hard time finding any info about that field. From what I can tell, neuroscientists and computer scientists seem to have largely ignored each other's work since the advent of the artificial neural network in the 1950's.

Is there a program which combines these two, anywhere in the world? Or should I go back and get a Bachelor's degree in computer science or artificial intelligence before moving on? I have good programming skills and experience with analysis of large data sets, but am lacking in advanced theoretical knowledge of things like machine learning.

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!"

3x2wkt,3,2015-12-16,I [25/F] have been talking with my friend [24/M] for a few months now. Unsure of what we're becoming.,throwawillthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3x2wkt/i_25f_have_been_talking_with_my_friend_24m_for_a/,"Hi everyone. I would just like some advice and opinions on what's been happening in my life. As a straight 25 year old female who has never had a relationship or anything even in the vicinity of that whole realm (read: yes, virgin), I'm pretty clueless about these things and incredibly shy, but only when it comes to that sort of stuff.

So I've been pretty school and career-oriented lately and part of my grad school's curriculum are a few networking events for the industry. When I started grad school a year ago, I met a guy. We exchanged business cards as he had done an internship at the same company as me at the same time (it's a big company and we did not know each other even existed). 

Fast forward another year after just becoming platonic social media friends and I posted a picture I took on instagram, lamenting that I'd never been to the piano bar nearby. He comments and says we should go one day soon as he never has either. We set a day and time, but end up walking around the park instead. It was really fun, we had a lot of great conversation and he said he wanted to do it again really soon. I should also mention that he lives in a place where I work seasonally, but do not live full-time. I do plan on moving down there as soon as I graduate from school as that will most likely be where I get a job. This time I was there for just the summer before school would be starting in mid-September. We first hung out maybe mid to late August.

He is very social in our industry and makes a ton of friends through networking that he actively hangs out with in town and over the course of the next few weeks before I left, we hung out maybe 7 or 8 times, sometimes just the two of us, sometimes with people from the industry he wanted me to meet. Every time it was platonic hanging out although just before the first time we hung out, I had a slight panic attack that this was a date and I didn't know how I felt about it at the time. Over the course of getting to hang out with him I had that hidden somewhere in the back of my head. The last day that I got to see him before leaving to go back to school, we hugged for a bit and that's probably about when the crushing started.

We texted semi-randomly throughout the 10 weeks I was in school. He would randomly send me some stuff on the happenings within our industry, ask my opinions on those things, or just send me pictures of stuff he thought I might like. As the end of my school semester got closer, we had a convention coming up that takes place back down in the town he is in. He would also be going to that convention as it is industry-wide and we made plans to see each other again. He seemed genuinely excited to be seeing me again soon and made sure to get the exact time I would be heading down.

That was a few weeks ago. After the convention ended, I had to head back up to pack and go stay with my parents for about two weeks before I would drive back down to his town to work at my seasonal job again for about two weeks. Unfortunately with the amount of work both of us were doing and him being in the middle of moving to a new place, we were only able to see each other on the last day of my visit.

So this is where it got interesting enough for me to be posting here, asking for advice. He texts me setting up a time and asks if I would be interested in seeing his new place as he is still putting the finishing touches right now before he has to be 100% moved out tomorrow. I head over and he gives me a tour. He asks if it is okay if we don't do the normal things we do together and I said I was fine with that as the temperature has been in the mid to upper 80s. After that, we end up driving to the small town about 10 minutes away that he says has a great little coffee shop he wants to show me. We get there and each order a coffee which he pays for. He's never done this before and so that crush in the back of my mind is jumping up and down for joy. I thank him profusely and we sit and have coffee for a little while. 

Once done, we walk around the town which has some cute things that he's seen before, but again, wanted to show me. It starts to downpour and so we book it back to his car where he mentions that he's getting hungry. I am too so we head to a place he suggests and he ends up sneakily paying for my dinner as well. Now I'm really starting to wonder if we're on a date and I didn't know it because every other time we've gone to eat or get coffee somewhere, we have always paid for our own. Then we head back to his place again where he introduces me to his roommates who are now home. We sit for a while, talking and playing around with his roommate's BB-8 droid that is controlled by phone. By this time, we know there are fireworks going off across the lake he lives on and he, his roommate, and I head out to the boat house to watch them. We sit next to each other and it's really really nice. After that, we head back to his apartment when it's time for me to leave (I have a long drive home the next day and still need to pack!). 

We both seem sad for me to go and he walks me to my car in the driveway where his next-door neighbors are unfortunately out washing their cars (at 10pm at night....). We say goodbye and he hugs me for a bit and then I leave pretty confused about that day.

So I'm pretty interested in hearing others' opinions on what the hell is happening with this guy. I'm so hesitant to just come out and say anything for a couple reasons. I'm pretty shy and inexperienced when it comes to this stuff and I think he is as well. He's also a colleague in my industry so I'm not even sure if this is the best idea to have a chance at ruining a good friendship and networking relationship by making things awkward by just asking if he wants to go out on a for-real date. Thank you in advance for your opinions!
   
**tl;dr**: Friend in my future work industry payed for my coffee/food/etc. when we last hung out together. Is it becoming something more than platonic friends or am I just reading too much into his nice gestures?"
3x3x47,1,2015-12-16,What minimum monthly income do I need for a used car loan?,needacar8781,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3x3x47/what_minimum_monthly_income_do_i_need_for_a_used/,"I'm 28, live at home, go to school full-time and work part-time as an engineering intern.  On the days I work, I take my dad's car which means that my mom is left at home without transportation.  Public transportation in the suburb I live in is nonexistent, and biking to work isn't an option because I work ~30 mi away from my house.  I need a reliable, fuel-efficient car ASAP because I don't make enough to pay for big repairs or tons of gas.

I started this job in September and because of my schedule this semester I was only able to make $800/month for the past 3 months.  I have $4800 from my financial aid saved up for a down payment on a car + registration/insurance/etc. and I'm looking into auto loans.  I'm looking for something reliable with decent gas mileage in the &lt;$7k price range, and if I put $3000 down and finance at 8% (2.5x the interest rate advertised by local credit unions due to my shitty credit), my monthly payment will come in around $90/month.  

My credit score is low and I think this is because I've never had a credit card.  I've already applied at two different local credit unions and was told by both that I need a co-borrower.

**Pertinent Info**

* Full-time student
* Part time intern, make $800/month from internship
* Total savings available for down payment/insurance/registration/taxes: $4800
* Credit score from CreditKarma: 617 (Transunion), 552 (Equifax)

**Monthly Expenses**

* Cell phone: $80 (this is on a family plan)
* Utilities: $50
* Internet: $50
* Groceries: $200
* Gas: $200 (filling up my dad's gas-guzzler once a week)

Should I ask my parents to cosign on a car loan?  Given my expenses and my income, it'll take me ~2 years to save up enough to buy a car with cash.  I'm not sure what my options are here."
3x406l,1,2015-12-16,An advice seeking post from a /r/LSAT and /r/lawschooladmissions veteran.,Ewwbullterd,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/3x406l/an_advice_seeking_post_from_a_rlsat_and/,"Hello all:

Basic background: I've taken the LSAT twice. Went from 157-166. It took me a while but I really got a good understanding from the test and slightly underperformed on the second take. I didn't really study for the first one.

I signed up and planned to retake the test in December but time slipped by, I took on other responsibilities, and didn't get a chance to continue studying. Really hate myself for that. I'm extremely confident that I could hit a 170 or above if I took the time to study again. A couple weeks after my second take (October 2015), I took  an LG and LR section timed and did really, really well, on par or better than where I was for October. I did some RC untimed and did well as well, but that was untimed.

Now I'm in the process of sending in apps. I need to finish up my personal statement and update my resume and I'm ready to go. My GPA and LSAT are likely enough to get me into my local Tier 1. It's a school that I can commute to, has decent employment, and has a ton of lawyers in the local legal community as alumni. It's got decent big law numbers (which I'm not aiming for) and pretty good clerkship numbers (which I am aiming for), I work for an attorney in the area and have great connections. On several occasions the attorney I work for has stated that I could come back here and work when I graduate. While it's not an ironclad offer, it is something that I am extremely sure will be available upon graduation, however, it would be a sort of ""hanging my own shingle"" deal within the firm, and I would likely be a partner right off the bat (small firm so not too much weight in this). The GPA and LSAT put me above both 75% for the school, so I'm looking at great scholarship money, hopefully full ride.

Here's what I'm struggling with though: I know I can score better. People around me like family, girlfriend, attorneys I work for, etc, think that I'm insane for even entertaining a retake back for the December test. But when I think about it, I really, really wish I had kept grinding. When I think about the test right now, I get nervous and anxious, because I know that I can score higher but don't really know if it's worth it. I've taken two years off already and really would have preferred to be in school already. And honestly, even if I scored better, I think that I'd take the full ride at my local Tier 1 over acceptance at a T14 or small scholarship at a T14. So I don't know if it's actually worth it.

I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance from others that I've taken the right path. I applied with my 157 and would have been looking at big debt from not so great schools. Now I'm in a position to go to any of my states schools, almost all of which are highly respected here, with great scholarship offers. But part of me really wants to study my ass off and do really well on the test. Like I said, I may not even attend any of the T14s I may get into over the full ride, but it's just who I am to want to do as best as I can. 

Anybody been in a similar situation? What did you do? Were you happy with what you did?

And something that isn't related to this is the GRE. How similar is it to the LSAT for those of you who have taken it? For the record, I'm all in on law school. I've worked for attorneys now for many months, I've done internships in law offices, etc. I've made sure that this is what I want. But I've also wanted to try my hand at that and see how well I do and what options I'm looking at. I'm extremely lucky I caught these subreddits before I accepted a law school offer a couple years ago and that I'm even in a position to consider the options. 

If you read this, thanks!

3x42vz,5,2015-12-16,NMom is at it again and my brother's in the middle. Where to go from here?,The_Other_Lawnchair,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3x42vz/nmom_is_at_it_again_and_my_brothers_in_the_middle/,"Hey all!

First, I want to thank everyone on this sub for helping me on my journey of realizing that the relationship I had with my mother was not normal, okay, or even close to healthy. More importantly, you helped me realize I could do something about it.

--------------------------------------

Long story short, my mother and I have not spoken for about a year and a half. There was no NC letter, I just stopped speaking to her, leaving it kind of open. A few months ago, I sent her the following letter to try to close the door on this, one way or the other.

I'm including the full text of the letters below since I couldn't find any examples of where to even start when writing a letter like this to an N when I was trying to do this. Hopefully they'll be of help to someone in the same situation.

**TL;DR: Letter from me to NMom:** You exhibit narcissistic behavior. Here are some examples. My kids don't exist yet, but when they do, I don't want them around that. In order for me to feel comfortable in having you around them, all of this needs to change.

**TL;DR: Letter from NMom to Me:** I'm sorry you feel that way. Just forgive me already. Here, I'll infantilize you to make you feel better.

So, that exercise went nowhere.

Now, after several months of no contact, she's blowing my phone up again.

My youngest brother recently got an internship near me and he'll be moving into a spare room I have in my house for the next 6 months or so. NMom tried sabotaging this from the beginning -- ""they [wife and I] don't want you there, they're gonna get sick of you, etc."" -- but that didn't work.

Now the fear of her not being in control of him is sinking in, and she's using the excuse of helping him move down as a way to get back into my life and stay in his. He's driving himself down and really all he has is clothes. Somehow, she thinks she needs to drive down too since he'll have to car loads of stuff and help him move in.

This can't happen. I'm need your help!

I've thought about writing a letter, including explaining that he's not moving to the middle of nowhere and we do have things like food and water here. Then I realized that would be pretty stupid of me trying to reason with her.

My gut tells me to stay the course with this, ""if things don't change, you can't be in my life"" conversation I've already started that she's ignored, and parlaying that into that including moving my brother into my house. She's simply not welcome here.

Do you think that would be effective? What sort of things should I be on the lookout for? What happens when she ignores all requests and shows up at my door? I'm fine with kicking her out, but I'm more worried on the stress that would place on my brother.

Thanks in advance!

-----------------------------------------------------

Full text of no contact -ish letters to and from NMom below:

Mom,

Over the past several months, it has become a weekly ritual for me to sit and stare at a blank sheet of paper, pen in hand, begging myself to write this letter to you. No matter how hard I tried, how many distractions I rid myself of, how much time and thought I put into the words I wanted to convey, how many therapy sessions I went to, nothing would come out.

I assume part of this is due to the extreme difficulty with which I face opening up to anyone in any context. I can remember one of our fights in the Fall before my wedding. I was finally able to tell you how I feel uncomfortable opening up to you and sharing things with you, and you told me, ""really? If you think that, then you're stupid."" There couldn't have been a more perfect response to validate my feelings.

I'm afraid this letter will fall on similar ears. However, I've come to realize that if this letter is dismissed or met with hostility, it is neither the fault of the pen, the ink, the paper, nor the writer. That realization, though seemingly small, is a major emotional stride I've made over these months.

There is not a single person in this world who has fought for my success more than you have. Ten years ago you helped me put together dozens of incredible college applications, and I got accepted to every one of them. Eight years ago, you helped me make my dream of studying abroad come true. Five years ago, you drove across the country with me to get me situated for grad school.

For all of these times, and the countless similar efforts inbetween, I am so appreciative. I know that I had done a terrible job of showing my appreciation for these things growing up, and for that I am sorry.

I'm now at a point in my life where considerations of children are occurring more and more frequently. Though they're still three or so years away, their best interests are already a constant consideration of mine. Where will we live? What schools will they go to? What financial steps to I need to take now to ensure I'm prepared? How can I make sure they enjoy a thoroughly loving relationship with their extended family, even though it is spread across the country in all directions? What relationship will they have with their grandmother?

I would love to be able to introduce them to the woman who would bend over backwards for her son. As a father, it would make me so proud to have such a grandmother for my children. 

But then I picture my kids playing in your living room when a fight breaks out -- one that is guaranteed to happen during any visit -- between you and dad, or [brother], or [adopted sister], or me. How could I expose them to the awful, hurtful things that you say in those fights, and the names that you call those who are supposed to be closest to you? How could I introduce them to such hostility? How could I teach them that this behavior and family dynamic is normal when I've spent hours in therapy over the past year learning -- now at 26 -- that it is far from normal?

What if my son was gay and you said the same things to him that you did to [brother - who is not gay but she thinks he is]? What if my daughter struggled with her weight and you gave her the same grief you gave [brother] about the healthy changes to his lifestyle? What if either of them were having relationship problems, and you told them ""nobody wants you,"" like you tell [adopted sister] about her family? How do you think that would make them feel?

Family is about much more than financial support or gift giving. There needs to be love -- complete and unconditional love. There needs to be a support system for the tough times that each of us go through, so that no one ever feels alone. 

In August I got a major promotion and am doing great things at work. In September, [wife] and I spent 11 days in the Czech Republic and Poland, and it was incredible. This week we bought our first house -- a dream home -- that's over 100 years old with a big backyard and in a great neighborhood near downtown Durham. We also just added another family member, [puppy], a 7 week old German shepherd mix. I have a truly incredible life, yet somehow I keep preventing myself from finding happiness in it. 

When I called you and told you that I was asking [wife] to marry me, you said, ""Okay....why?"" When I told you about the iPad I won, you yelled at me because I didn't automatically give it to you since you deserved one. When you had your court hearing, you spent the rest of the day yelling at us, your children, for a mistake you, an adult, made. When I was applying to and getting accepted to grad schools across the country, you gave me a guilt trip on how I was leaving and you weren't good enough for me to stay around, never accepting that [local school] simply wasn't the right place for me.

Not once, from the time I said I was asking [wife] to marry me, to the time we said our vows, did you have anything positive to say about our marriage. Here I was, your son, telling you that I had found the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I was so happy to have her in my life, and I couldn't wait to marry her in front of our friends and family. Instead of being happy for me, you spent the next year and a half making the entire process all about you and making me feel awful for all of the ways I had offended you and disgraced our family. All I wanted to do was have a simple wedding where my friends and family just showed up, had a good time, and were genuinely happy for me, but that was too much for you to allow.

I can't remember the last thing that I accomplished that you celebrated instead of criticized. I want my children to be able to find and experience that happiness.

I want my children to know that they're in a safe environment when they're with family. I don't want them to ever have to worry about being kicked out of the house. I don't want them to have to walk home from miles away in the dark after you kick them out of the car. I don't want my children to learn that it's okay to yell at complete strangers -- waiters, clerks, or otherwise -- because they didn't get their way. I don't want my children to be told that their grandmother wishes they were dead, or considers them dead.

They don't need someone to buy them things. That's not what's important. They need the grandmother they deserve, and as of now, I can't be sure that's what they will receive. I know that I could never expose them to an environment or a person who could do such damage to them, and unless there are some significant changes, I don't know that I can do the same for myself.

This has been one of the toughest things I've ever had to do, but its something I care about very deeply. If you want to respond, that's great. If not, that's okay too. If so, please take your time and consider what you'd like to say. Writing a letter would allow for each voice to be heard without interruption, unlike a phone call or a text message.

I really hope that this letter inspires change within you.

--------------------------------------


Dear /u/The_Other_Lawnchair,

I'm not sure where to begin or exactly what to say in response to your letter. I'm not sure what you want or if I should say anything at all.

I will start by saying how much I truly love you, always have, and always will no matter what you think, say, do, or feel. You are first and foremost my son, and have always been one of the most important individuals in my life, whether you were living in the same house, state, or otherwise. All I have ever wanted for you was the best I could provide for you to have a great and fulfilling life and be a part of it. It would include the good, the bad, the happy, the sad, memorable, and loving, and everything else inbetween.

I am not going to give you reasons, excuses, or explanations, but I will tell you how very sorry I am that you feel the way you do. I'm not perfect by any means, but I am a human being and as such I'm not infallible like every other human on this earth, including you. We all at some point in our lives say things, do things that hurt one another's feelings, but the great thing about being human is learning how to forgive, forget, work through it all and learn how to let it go.

Sometimes when we are hurting for one reason or another, we only see what is right there, right now, and we don't allow ourselves the moment to get past the negativity and it eats away at us, making us more bitter than ever. Communication is ket to being able to talk things out, without pointing blame, without subtle innuendo,, pointing the finger, and to remain non-emotional. Unfortunately when communication stops, as time goes on, resentment and hostility sets in and you can't figure out how to get past that when you feel the other party can't or isn't hearing what you have to say. sometimes emotions take over and are not as controllable as we would like them to be, no matter how much we try.

""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" was always something I would sing to you when you were little to get you to calm down and go to sleep. Think of the words, the melody, or sing it to yourself and see how it makes you feel.

On that note, I'm going to tell you again how much I love you, then, now, and forever no matter what. You are always first and foremost my son! I only want what's best for you and for you to have what I didn't and more. I'm sorry if you felt it was not acceptable as to how I went about it. I only can tell you I'm sorry you feel that way. In closing, I'm leaving where you want to go from here in your hands.

Love you always, Mom."

I will be receiving a w-9 for approximately $22,000 of income from October 1 to December 14. I also held a regular w-2 job where I made earned $45000 with $7500 withheld as federal income tax. I live in Washington so no state tax.

I figured I need to send about $6000 off as estimated tax. I want to make sure I do it correctly.

As far as I can see the way one pays estimated tax is:

* figure out how much you might owe based on any number of sketchy calculators
* Sign up for EFTPS
* make payment in EFTPS by January 15 for income earned between September 1 and December 31.
* Do your annual income taxes as you normally would but enter the payment you made to apply against the total amount owed.

Questions:

* Is my list of steps correct? Do the dates line up or do I fall into a special case?
* Is there a good calculator for calculating estimated payments?
* I'm in the 25% bracket on the federal income tax level, but I've read that self-employment taxes are higher. How do I figure out my ""self-employment bracket"" especially when I have w-2 income from most of the year?

TL,DR:  I want to stop smoking because pot and substance abuse in general are holding me back.  I want to stop smoking so I can focus on improving myself, my life, and the lives those around me.


Overall, I'm not happy anymore.  I'm not happy with my life, my grades, my weight/health, and my relationship with my family.  I'm not sure if I'm depressed or if I just hit a few bumps on the road of life.  Either way, weed is not helping me and is hurting me in the long run.

I'm a young man with so much potential.  I attended and graduated from a prestigious highschool, I have a long history of serving the community, and have had the opportunity to take two summer internships (same company both times).  I'm a natural leader with a good head on my shoulders and a caring heart.  But lately, I haven't been acting like myself.  I've ignored responsibilities because of apathy/laziness, feeling bad about shirking my duties I either ignore or lash out at my friends.  Getting my drive and motivation back is the main reason I want to quit smoking.

I've been blessed with a healthy able-body, yet I continue to degrade my body.  I used to be very proud of being built like a tank and having muscles, but now I'm ashamed to look in the mirror.  My poor diet and lack of exercise of the last few years is catching up with me.  I know it's never too late to reverse the trend, but pot is not helping the situation or my confidence.

My parents hate marijuana and I have let it drive a wedge between me and my dad.  My dad and I never had a great relationship, but my use of marijuana has caused me to become more distance from my family altogether because I don't want to see my dad.  I know he'll be mad, that he'll think I'm a disappointment.  I love him, but I fear him.  He'll go over board and try to pull me out of school, have me admitted to some high security rehab facility, or he may even disown me.  Once I get to a stage in my life where I am entirely supporting myself, I won't care much what my father thinks.  Don't get me wrong, I want to improve my relationship with my dad, but that can't be done until I'm clean.

My life isn't bad, but I want to make it better.  That starts by giving up tree and getting back in shape.  I'll start regaining the confidence I've lost along the way and I know the real me will start to shine through the gloom that's been surrounding me the last few months.

Feel free to leave any suggestions, ideas, or comments.  I'd appreciate them."
3x4lfw,9,2015-12-16,Looking for perspective on counseling degree,throwaway34598471,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/3x4lfw/looking_for_perspective_on_counseling_degree/,"I am looking for perspectives on my situation:

I [M28] want for my wife to find something she truly enjoys doing and not hate her job.  She [F27] has a BA in psych and now wants to enter a CACREP accredited program to eventually gain licensure as an LMHC.  She doesn't like school, but really is excited about being able to help others and provide therapy.

More about us: we both work full time now, and don't need more money.  She currently works in a inpatient mental health facility (not in counseling) and finds the work environment to be toxic, draining, and extremely stressful (and low pay to boot).  She took the job to get good experience before entering such a program, and she is optimistic that she could get a counseling job that is in a better environment (it is a public facility that takes everyone, even involuntarily).

However, I have just now begun to look at MS and MA programs and am concerned about costs, time, and stress (of course me being in finance I'm always jumping to number).  



I have a few questions:

1) Does the location of a school matter?  We are looking at programs in different regions - does she need to get her license in the same state as her school?

2) Does school ""prestige"" matter?  Some programs (Northwestern, etc) look to have very developed, almost ""fancy-looking"" programs, but cost nearly $100k in total tuition, while others have accredited and more modest looking programs, for $30,000 total.

3)  Are supervised work/practicum/internships stupid-hard to find,  do they pay anything (vs nothing)?  I am concerned with this being a ""trap"" for some programs, where it's damn near impossible to actually get licensed because no one will take you as an intern.

4) Is the work extremely high stress no matter what in your first year?

5) Are there other questions or other paths we should consider?

Honestly, I would never choose a role like this, but the world is a better place because of all the work that people like you have done and I understand that for many of you the work is worthwhile.  I just want my wife to find something she enjoys, just like I enjoy my work, but I don't want her to end up worse off in the end.

Thanks for any and all input!"

3x594p,4,2015-12-16,My [21 M] ex [21 F] said a lot of bad things about me to our common group of friends. What should I do?,extalkingtrash,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3x594p/my_21_m_ex_21_f_said_a_lot_of_bad_things_about_me/,"I go to a small university campus. Everyone has connections to everyone. I was gone for about a year and a half to do an internship. Right before I left for the internship is when I broke up with my ex.

The reason I broke up was because: Her previous ex (who she dumped and then moved on to me) still liked her. After she went no contact with him for a couple months, they met again in university. It was obvious he liked her, and she decided to text him so much without me knowing (they had over 1500 texts in the first 3 weeks). They also had phone calls with each other which I didn't know about and had to figure out myself. I called her out on this and she got defensive, saying it was just for studying. There was a day when she avoided me all day just to hang out with him. And that's when I got really upset, and decided to break up. 

I trusted her to not catch feelings for him, but I thought it was just so weird that even when he fully liked her, she never did anything about it (if anything, she made the situation worse by talking to him so much).

With that said, when we broke up, she wanted to still talk things through but I said there isn't much left to talk about (I told her what I had problems with, but she just kept saying how I was the problem and how I had trust issues and how I was being so overprotective - because I told her that she shouldn't be talking to him so much without me knowing).

After that, I went on my internship for 1.5 years. I came back recently, and saw all the friends on campus (as expected, it's a small campus). She is dating her previous ex again (which I saw coming and don't really mind.. he fully liked her and they started dating Very Soon after me and her stopped talking).

I talked to one of my old friends recently and turns out this ex said A Lot of bad things about me. So bad that he didn't even want to repeat it. She said I put such strict rules on her, how I was so overprotective and had problems with everything she did, and how I always saw faults in everything. She then said how I didn't contact her once ever since breaking up with her (I broke up over text.. I'll admit that was a dumb move by me). It kinda hurt hearing this, because this entire time, I only said good things about her. And I also felt that we were very good when we were together, and I didn't know she was capable of saying all this about me.

My reputation isn't that great at the moment. I'm trying to keep a small circle of friends but this is such a small campus that everyone is common friends with everyone. I haven't talked to her yet, and I really don't think we'll ever talk (I don't want to get involved with her and her bf's relationship again like last time. Also, on the first two days when she saw me, she Did Not want me to see her at all. She put her hood on and looked the other way hoping I wouldn't see her. Then in the next few days, I caught her looking at me once or twice - I'll admit, I've just stared at her once too. But now, she literally ignores me and walks passed me like we've never met, which is why I don't see us talking anymore).

What should I do? Should I tell people what really happened, and risk causing more drama? Or should I tell only my small circle of friends the story, and keep a bad reputation until I finish university (in 2 years)?
   
**tl;dr**: Ex said lots of bad things about me (part of which weren't even true) while I was gone on an internship. We go to a really small university were everyone knows each other and have mutual friends, and now that I'm back from my internship, I notice my reputation is really bad. I haven't talked to my ex at all yet, and don't plan to (she's in a relationship with her previous ex who she left for me back in the days, and I don't want to get involved in that again. Also, after the first few days of me catching her looking at me - I'll admit, I've just stared at her once too - she literally ignores me now and looks the other way).

Should I tell people what really happened and defend my reputation, while risking causing more drama? Or should I just stick with my small circle of friends and let everyone else believe what she said about me? We're gunna be in this small campus for two more years or so?"

3x5qo5,7,2015-12-16,"Almost 29, virgin, directionless, life was a constant downhill in the last couple of years",anythinggoes_,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3x5qo5/almost_29_virgin_directionless_life_was_a/,"I'll spare the wall of text but many of your posts are very familiar to me. I had a failry normal life up to a point, so basically something like:

- 0-18: done stuff, went to school, travelled etc.
- 18-19: went to a shit uni, no friends, wanted to switch
- 20-22: went to amazing uni, got new friends, went to parties, joined student clubs etc. you know the stuff
- 23-24: went to abroad for a year, gained friends, but this is where shit happened

So basically I came home from my internship, I became depressed, basically dropped out of university but not really (went on and off for a couple of years, went back again etc.). I lost ALL my friends somehow since I didn't have any interest doing stuff anymore. 

So now I'm here turning 29 in a month, have 0 friends except some people I talk to on Facebook who all have their lives, I have a job but I dont enjoy it, I wasted 3 or 4 years on just being a NEET with a job (played thousands of hours of vidya, got fat etc.)

So in the last half a year I lost a ton of weight, I got half my shit together (I shower daily, I clean my flat etc.) and so on, but I'm totally alone and I have major anxiety problems when talking to people and just having a good time (something I used to do, ironically I'm not sure how to do).

So people who actually managed to climb out please give me some advice:

- how do you pretend you're ""okay"" now? I always feel anxious when I talk to ""normal"" people, like I just pretend to be normal? Does that make sense? 

- how do you deal with the fact that no one cared about you when you were really down? I mean at least I surely know no one cared about me except one good friend. All I can think of now is how people ""play this game"" when you're popular therefore you get more popular etc. It's like there is no room there for sincerity.

- I've never had a relationship, this puts such a huge weight on me. I'm not even sure what to do about this. I was an ugly kid but always somehwhat popular with guys, not so much with girls. I think this is a HUGE part of why I think people perceive me as a loser. It's almost like they treat people who get girls VERY differently, and the more easier you can get girls the more popular you are. 

- How do you deal mentally with the fact that you ""wasted"" years while other people had fun and did stuff? How do you deal with seeing happy people on Facebook? I'm not jealous or want bad stuff to happen to happy people, I'm like ""what if"" all the time.

But the biggest question of all is where to go from here. I generally see that people usually get their shit together by their 30s, a lot of them get married and had degrees while I'm still struggling with mine and I don't really care about it either. I'm working in my field but I burned out in recent years and basically can't imagine doing this for another 10 years.

So this is half rant half asking for advice. I'm a bit drunk so this post is probably a bit unstructured but there you have it.

EDIT: also about girls, I have tried for years to find a girlfriend, I got rejected a LOT of times, got ignored etc. but I thought surely this is all part of life. While some of my friends got beautiful girls and that makes you feel even shittier. One thing being ugly or just not attractive, its another that you also feel shit about it... I fixed SOME of the stuff I was very unhappy with (I had a jaw surgery for example, I was ""fortunate"" enough to born with a recessed jaw...) but I still have a lot more.

My sister (16y.o.) has been dating a Mormon for over a year. He's great, and his family has become a part of our family. I have no issue with that. My mom and sister started checking out their temple. Again, nothing wrong with being open-minded. But now they've become ""investigators,"" we have missionaries coming our house frequently, and they are thinking about conversion.

Now, as someone who tends to be fairly liberal, I want to be open-minded. However, I find some great flaws in the Mormon theology and find the culture cult-like. I am a social work undergrad who has done an internship in an elementary school. I worked with many kids who come from LDS families and had a few ex-Mormon co-workers. Needless to say, I've seen some ugly sides of the religion.

I'm scared that my sister and (especially) mom are being brainwashed by this. I mentioned that I felt some of their practices (ex: only letting missionaries consume ""approved"" media) was cultish and controlling, and she said it wasn't. I mean, even the idea that they can't really fully join the church unless they convert is a red flag alone.

I'm scared that my mom and sis will be hurt by this cult and/or will end up in hell for rejecting the true Gospel. I'm also worried that my dad will file for divorce if a full conversion happens. 

What can I do in the meantime? I don't want to shun my mom and sis, or even tell them to stop being around her bf's family. But I want their eyes to be opened to the flaws of this religion. And I also don't want to have the ""ill show THEM there evil Mormons a piece of my mind"" attitude."

I'm now 22 (soon to be 23), still living with my parents, Obama's headed out the door soon, and Katy Perry is twice as big of a deal compared to the end of my high school days.

In all seriousness...here's details. I'm probably getting what I asked for since I major in the engineering field. It's hard, yes...but the pressure just seems to mount because it feels as if i haven't had any true form of success or progress in my life since graduating from HS. It's also along the lines of what I want to do; I'm aiming for a computer engineering career after college graduation.

I've failed at least one class in 5 out of my first 8 semesters in college. GPA is a high 2, but not quite 3. Thus, my path on the curriculum is as bad as someone who needed to take pre-algebra and everything else in between before taking calculus and other big math classes. To make matters worse, I only have *ONE* grant to pay off some of my tuition and I only have seasonal work at a ballpark to show for it. No engineering internships in this time span either. And to think, a good handful of colleagues who were in my orientation class in my first semester graduated from college THIS PAST MAY. I watched them accept their degrees (on my birthday, more ironically) while I worked a ball game to reel in a paycheck. Having lectures with my close family about my struggles is **dreadful**. The situation is rough...and I try to stay positive in the midst of it all.

I don't want to change majors...not an option with about 50 credits to go anyways. Could have done it earlier, but I still felt motivated to push on and stay the course....and I still do. At the same time, I can only be frustrated with all of my shortcomings. Before this year, I needed public transportation or a bandwagon ride from family/friends to get to school. Studying late at night was difficult; you'd have to put on a live football game at 3am in the morning to keep me up. Couldn't stay late at school either because there's no way home by bus/train after midnight. I come home and struggle to find a quiet place to study and my bedroom is an easy ticket to my bed for sleep. I have a handful that I could point out, but I'll keep this list short.

I'm concerned this will go bad...somehow, someway...even if I continue to force myself to hope for the best and that I'll act on it. I'm approaching my middle 20's and if all else does fail, I could be another statistic: graduating from college without a job beyond the Walmart cashier and McDonald's chef, jobs that any adult could do in his or her sleep. What aggravates me sometimes when I think about my struggle is how much better things could have been.

In the midst of my senior year, I was set on going to Penn State. Best college that accepted me (also the first), strong engineering program, and a new setting for me to grow. Sadly couldn't afford it, so I had to turn away the opportunity I so desperately wanted. Instead, I'm stuck in the same city I've lived in since birth...and besides a driver's license, my first car, and finding love, seems like there's nothing (much) to look forward to in terms of my next taste of accomplishment, personal or academic."

I grew up with loving and caring parents, a beautiful sister and all the things I could have ever wanted. It was obvious to anyone around me how spoiled I was from the security and protection my family gave me. I excelled at school and most of the unambiguous endeavors I took part in. Early on I noticed that I didn’t have much patience with myself and the things I wanted to accomplish. For one, I wanted to have a more appealing appearance, always felt dissatisfied but wouldn’t put in the work, because I got everything else so easily. My mother adored me and always gave me approval for the grades that didn’t cost me any effort. Maybe it was for my sister who taught me everything I knew, but had trouble to accomplish the grades she helped me get. I knew my life would be easy, so I never put much effort into it. Looking back, my self-respect must have been at an all-time low because I didn’t even get a hair cut for several months at a time. I woke up as late as possible and sat through school to get home and play video games. I always got all the stuff I wanted and so I didn’t even finish the games I got. Whenever I faced a challenge I couldn’t instantly solve, I just chose another game. There were so many of them.

Despite some minor dissatisfactions, I didn’t feel like I couldn’t go on like this until I found out I was gay. I did have a certain feeling for it, obviously, but I could always push it into my subconscious. After all, I was dating girls and it worked out fine. My parents told me early on, what gay people were about. They were promiscuous and secretly wanted to be women. My uncle has been married to his partner for over 10 years and they always lived in an open relationship. In addition there have been rumors that some sort of molestation has been going on in my fathers childhood by his elder brother. In the collective mind of my family, and I have always taken part in this, gay people were unethical sluts.

In the summer of 2011 my Spanish teacher decided that I was gifted. She signed me up for a program for gifted students and I reluctantly agreed to go after having a talk with one of the deans of the summer school. I still don’t know why they took me in, but they did. This was the first time someone actually expected me to be disciplined, having a course program throughout the day, learning at night or being humiliated in front of class. I hated everyone at class, because I thought them to be pretentious. Actually, they just had genuine interest apart from playing video games. At my first day I forced myself to go out to the camp fire and just sit there, although I wouldn’t strike up any conversation.  Some guy with the most ridiculous scarf (to me at the time, it was violet) sat next to me and told me everything about his recent trip to the film festival in Cannes. I had been the biggest movie buff at the time and could easily  keep up. It was a great experience. Obviously, I brought my laptop to although it wasn’t allowed to have one and a whole bunch of movies. In the afternoon I would watch Antonioni films to pass the time. The two of us started watching the movies together. Since he had a single room and I didn’t, we could easily watch movies there without distraction.

We spent a lot of time together and I learned to appreciate the other students. One evening he told me he was gay in the most awkward but seemingly casual way. It wasn’t that big a deal, but I hadn’t met an openly gay man I could actually stand before. I knew that my chance had come. I was at this camp, isolated from family and friends and had a guy who was obviously down for some action. Given it would turn out to be a disaster or someone would find out, I could still just leave camp saying I didn’t like it, like so many times before. I liked it. A lot, to say the least. Here I was, sucking of the guy who I had despised a few days before.

The next few weeks, we hooked up a lot. We stopped watching movies and just fucked all day. It was a great experience. Finally, camp was over sooner than I would have dreamed and it was time to say good-bye. To me, this wasn’t hard at all, because it had been a friendship mostly. For him, it turned out to be much more. I decided to cut contact and just go on with my life. I knew now I was gay, but I didn’t want to deal with it at this moment. This dude was more than stubborn. He called me several times a week, just to hear my voice. It was gruesome at first, but I got the hang of it. Finally I allowed him to come over to my parents, as long as he would stay in the guest room. I could sneak in and fuck him at night and just pretend to be friends at day.

Finally, we both graduated and I decided to move to a bigger city to study Theatre and Film. I told him, that this had been the best time, but it was now over. I didn’t want to have a relationship with a guy and I decided that moving to a bigger city would make it easier to fulfill my sexual needs without having a clingy guy around all day. He „coincidentally“ decided to move to the same city and gave up his dream to study in the capital. I then agreed to move in with him. This was my biggest mistake.

Within the next year, I had fallen in love. This hadn’t happened to me before and so I got hit pretty bad. I felt secure and my bad habits came back. I stayed in while he was studying biochemistry. He was at uni all day, while I took care of everything. I learned to cook the most delicious meals out of boredom and made the laundry and whatever had to be done. My studies went well, but like before I would easily get an A on anything I tried.

He had always been very active and traveling around the world for internships and debating tournaments. I supported him and always felt like a man should have his space. I didn’t feel a need to work on my own needs and was fine with being the First Lady at most of his events.

Last year, I found The Red Pill. I read a lot of it, since I had too much time on my hands. Since I left my parents home I have been hanging out with theatre people. In my first semester I read the feminist basic literature and joined the gay union. It felt great finally living my true self and being accepted, fighting for rights or what felt like a revolution back then. It was not. The Red Pill to me was an abomination. It was straight white men claiming that women liked to be treated sexist. The irony is, that I didn’t even notice how I turned myself into a housewife at the same time.

About one year ago, my first boyfriend flew to one of his debating tournaments and I had to spent New Years with some of my gay friends. It was an okay night, but I began to feel a certain emptiness within this specific group of friends. I have observed this emptiness in a lot of gay men since then. To me, this lifestyle of hooking up wasn’t the way to go, since my relationship was doing great.

In January this year I picked him up from the airport after a long flight and he decided to go to bed immediately. I was still up and decided to go on reddit or anything and used his laptop. At this moment I noticed, that he was chatting with someone via Facebook and I decided to spy on him, which I hadn’t done before. Since he didn’t ever log out, I could easily follow the convo going on in the next room. Within the next half hour I figured out that he cheated on me while at the tournament. I confronted him, because I had no idea how to deal with such a behavior at this point. I was feeling too secure, that something like that could never happen to me. I don’t want to go through the whole process again, since it has just been tedious and I showcased a lot of my „beta“ qualities. After more spying (I know) it could easily be said, that he had cheated on me with at least 12 different guys within the last 18 months. I had been pretty naive to never suspect anything.

Everyone was convinced that it was all his fault. He was an ass-hole and i was this sweet innocent guy who deserved to have a loving partner. This was my truth as well and has been for the first months of the separation. It never occurred to me, that there were other possibly hotter guys out there and that I gave him the impression he could never loose me no matter what. At this time it dawned on me. I had to take care of myself and couldn’t expect someone else to fix me.

I have been changing my attitude to the Red Pill several times and I am still figuring out, what to make of it all. I have been working out a lot and studied much harder. When I first stepped into a gym I weighed a shocking 128 lbs at 1,83m and now weigh in a 158 lbs. I am still not there yet, but people have been noticing. When I look back it is shocking to see myself in these pictures. How I decided to look.

I am now in a committed relationship again, after some major twists and turns, but that might be a story for another time."

3x8n16,27,2015-12-17,The Bad Bet .,IliadsTangent,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3x8n16/the_bad_bet/,"TL:DR. The House of Hypergamy doesn't always win.

Body-
I've noticed an interesting phenomenon in my social groups of late. First we must understand what I'm referring to.

Most of us are familiar with the AF/BB system. Girl meets profitable boy, girl gets boy to legally sign over his assets in marriage, girl fucks local Alpha for physical genes, girl has kid, and from here its a paid future no matter what thanks to Western Family Court.

Yet chance offers no pussy pass. Sometimes the woman meets a man on the rise: an engineering student, perhaps. Maybe even someone in med school. Realizing if she doesnt lock down this prospect Some Other Female Will, she drags the guy to the altar by hook or crook .She gets married, he becomes a big time doctor, she punches out some kids and its happily ever after.

Then Something Goes Wrong. His program gets cut. The firm he interns at declines to hire him. The PhD. department drops him due to politics.
Med school sends him packing. Budgets get cut and his masters program is out. Any number of things can turn a man's fortune around for the worse, and when that happens Cupcake is toast.

See she's already married the guy believing he's going to be a success. When shit hits the fan, generally its she who becomes the breadwinner . She can't divorce him yet, as shed end up owing *him* alimony when the math is computed. She cant easily look for a new husband, because shes already married and would get shamed by the other gashes if she blatantly shopped for a new Beta. 

So she resolves to hit the CC on the down low. These women are so desperate for a way out of their jam that they'll basically throw themselves on any man even slightly higher value then her husband. It's beyond doubt she's cheated on him already, and will continue to do so until she finds a better Betabux.

This can have a devastating feedback effect for the man. He might be looking at doing something great in the world , he has a new wife, and according to society he's becoming a Good Man.
Then he loses his job , standing, or academic prospects. He may have to work at the local factory to make the rent. Then he finds out wifey is cheating, and our feminist churches will say God is holding him responsible for failing to provide as he promised when she married him. Everywhere he turns, people take her side of things . It gets even worse if she divorces him for a close friend or family with better success prospects. Even if she doesn't leave, he has to share his life with a frustrated harpy constantly angry she Bet On the Wrong Horse while her friends post Facebook updates from designer stores and island cruise ships paid for by THEIR RICHER husbands.
I know because my fastest social group lays have been with women in this position.

Lessons learned.
-DGM. Don't.Get.Married.
-Life will hit you with adversity. Whatever it may be , you as a man are facing it alone no matter what. 
-When the chips are down and life hands you lemons-as will happen to us all in some respect- being single means you can move , accept opportunities, change your surroundings and life as needed to get back on your feet without being weighed down by cupcake's demands and requirements. 
-Beware women who approach you on the way up. As fast as they come into your life they will leave it even faster should your fortunes change . Don't buy the hype, don't fall in love, or think that the stars are aligned because every box in your life is checked. The more money and status you make the harder you must work to sort and plate women. "

He does not receive the rest his loan until February and his existing funds have dried up.  He is requesting that he pay for my gas and groceries in exchange for me paying the rent so that he can charge it on his credit cards.

I am too proud to ask my parents for anything and his parents are in no position to help.  I want to do this on our own but I feel that he is not really being active enough in seeking work.

Computer science letter.",queenofthedamnediam,diycompsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/diycompsci/comments/3x992t/oh_god_im_applying_to_grad_school_cover_letter/,"So, I'm applying to Georgia Tech's online MS program in computer science. I wrote a personal statement/cover letter, but I have been out of school for a few years and I'm so nervous.
Critiques, please!!

A hallmark trait of any successful software engineer is the drive to self-learn. No successful programmer will be able to continually develop their craft if they are unable, or unwilling, to study topics on their own time.

I graduated from Moravian College in 2012, with a Bachelor’s of Science in Neuroscience. Since graduating, I have studied an undergraduate degree’s worth of computer science and programming courses. Using open courseware, such as coursera.com, Udemy.com, MIT Open Courseware, and other credible online sources, I have built up my programming skills. I realize that not having a formal education may seem insufficient, but my drive and dedication to give myself an education should more than make up for the formalities of a brick-and-mortar institutional education. An online Master’s program in computer science will more than understand that an online education can be comparable to an “in-person” education, especially if the student is driven, as I am.

During the past two years, I have taught myself basic and advanced computer science concepts. Topics I studied include logic, algorithms, cryptography, data structures, databases, computer networks, operating systems, computer architecture, software engineering, and software debugging. I taught myself to program in the following computer languages: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python and Java. I also learned some SQL, both in-class and as part of a previous employment position.

I have also completed an internship in software engineering, honing my programming skills and filling in any knowledge gaps I might have had. During the internship, I learned more about relational databases and SQL concepts, web development, and using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to develop and maintain a software company website. I also learned to work with a software development team and use Java to develop business software packages that were sold to clients. I believe that having completed this internship has given me an even stronger foundation to do well in this Master’s program.

During my career development, I have found myself being pulled in the direction of software engineering. The challenge and continual evolution of the field are exactly what draws me in. Knowing that there is always much to learn, and that there is no cap on the knowledge base, drives me to continue on in the field.

In looking through the program’s coursework, I recognize many topics that I have studied or have been exposed to. I do feel prepared to take on the challenge of this program, and hope that you will allow me to. Having a Master’s degree in computer science will afford me the extended skills and credibility that will make me more marketable when I begin seeking programming employment positions.

3x9upa,3,2015-12-17,Help getting motivated every day? (kinda long),bftrollin402,motivation,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/3x9upa/help_getting_motivated_every_day_kinda_long/,"So...I graduated college in Chicago in 2014, basically 2 years ago. At the end of that time (the last year), and since then, life has been tough for me and I'm trying to change my life in a positive way so that I can be an overall happier, healthier, and better human. Easier said than done.

Going back to college a bit, my last year/ year and a half, I realized I had been dealing with anxiety that was quite bad for some time, had a really shitty breakup, and suddenly got the most sick I had been in my life. For years I kinda knew that I had a problem with anxiety, but I always told myself that taking pills wasn't the answer, and I didn't believe in it. But, after a breakup and the added stress of the 2nd half of college, I just couldn't handle it. I remember a particular time when every day was a complete struggle just to get through it. I was doing things simply to get through the day, but nothing I did was really enjoyable. In one specific instance, I remember going to the art museum with a friend, and I couldn't concentrate on anything at all...even when we got food after, I had to force myself to eat because I knew I needed food, but I just felt like throwing up. It was at this point that I understood why people take medication for anxiety/depression...it was just too much to handle. I started seeing a therapist and got on Celexa/citalopragm. This helped a ton, but I have also felt a lot less creative than I used to be. I don't know if it's because of not having school to get me to do stuff, the medicine, or just me?...

Around this time I also got really sick and I needed an inhaler just to walk around and up stairs. I was given MANY doses of antibiotics &amp; steroids, which were really the only things that made me feel better. I started seeing a ton of doctors, who all just prescribed me the same stuff, not really knowing what caused it or what *SPECIFICALLY* it was that was ailing me. At this point, my asthma (I've never had it before) is pretty well controlled, but I still have shitty sinuses (chronic sinusitis, which I had surgery for), so I apparently need to get allergy shots and/or Xolair...but doctors really still don't have a definitive answer if this will solve my problems...This whole dilemma has been a huge area of stress and sadness for me over the past year +. It has made me super sad, and most of the time, I was unable to ride my bike and do a lot of the things that most normal people are able to do because I would need an inhaler a ton (way more than anyone should take), and then also couldn't breathe through my nose. A lot of friends and family have just not understood the pain and hardship involved with not being able to breathe. People told me to just get over it, and plenty of other sentiments like it. I know there are plenty of humans out there with lives much worse than mine, but this is still my life, and my pain, so I feel like it's still justified. Today, I can breathe through my nose, but cannot smell, which is also actually quite depressing. BUT, I have been riding my bike every day again, and have started the [C25K](https://www.reddit.com/r/c25k) program. I have began some of the changes, but still need to do more.

All that was basically a lot of background, and now to where I'm at now: I'm working in retail part time, and a restaurant/charcuterie place, and trying to become financially independent. Up to now, my parents helped me A LOT, especially when I was really sick, because I couldn't work as much. I realize how immensely lucky I am to have this help, so please don't harp on me for that. 

My problem is that I'll work 40+ hours a week, with the weekends usually having me work until 2am at the restaurant. Then, I end up sleeping in a ton, and working again. On days off, I end up still sleeping in, and don't get all the things done that I want. I end up just being worn out, and discouraged that I'm working paycheck to paycheck with minimum wage jobs. I have a huge heart, and a mind filled with all these things I WANT to get done and create. As I said before, I want to change my life for the better, and I want to use my regained ability to exercise to lose weight that I've always had and always hated...here are the things I want to do:

1. Get into Jiu Jitsu, in hopes that it will help with exercise (a good friend claims it's really fun, as well as a workout) and help me gain more discipline in my life that has been lost since leaving school.

2. Start creating again. I used to LOVE photography, but my school didn't show me AT ALL how to do anything after graduation. They didn't even make me do an internship to see what it might be like. I also love screen printing, letterpress, zines...the list goes on.

3. Continue C25k and run a 5k in the spring.

4. Start a daily mindfulness meditation practice.

5. other stuff that aren't entirely as important

I WANT to do all of these things, very badly! I have books on all the subjects, and watched plenty of videos...BUT where oh where do I build the DISCIPLINE or get the MOTIVATION and ENERGY to wake up early (or earlier) and get these things started so that I can actually get them done? Please shower me with your advice. I really appreciate you reading this, and potentially helping me.

3xa5la,319,2015-12-17,"Repaid $87,000 over the course of 4 years. Here are some strategies I used to get there.",GottheOrangeJuice,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3xa5la/repaid_87000_over_the_course_of_4_years_here_are/,"Hello PF,

As of today, I have officially brought my undergraduate student loan debt [balance to ZERO]( http://imgur.com/Lka9D06). It took 4 years, 7 months, and 12 days to get to this point. I wanted to post here to help anyone who is going to be taking on a similarly large amount of debt or is currently facing a large number like I was. I hope it helps. 

**Tip #1 – Know what you’re getting into before you take on the debt.**
When I was selecting where to attend college, the financial side was always on my mind. At the age of 18, I didn’t quite understand what debt really meant. Honestly, I didn’t really know what having to pay any bills at all meant. In high school, I worked jobs that let me pay for fun or easy things like going to the movies, gas money, or improving my wardrobe. I didn’t know what living on my own was going to mean financially and didn’t have an idea of what life after college would look like. Regardless, I always knew from the start that any money used to pay for college was on me to pay back. My parents very nicely offered to supplement my federal loans with Parent Plus loans, but all of that money was my responsibility to repay. It is key for you to make sure you understand who is going to be paying for what if others are involved in your college decision.  I also knew that I wanted to go to a pricier school. I ended up deciding on Penn State which, while a “state” school, comes with a big price tag. Luckily, I was able to talk about the cost of Penn State with my older siblings who also went there. I came to a rough estimate of $20,000ish a year. It was a little more expensive my first two years, and cheaper in the last two when scholarships came through.  All told, I knew I was committing to about $80,000 if I sent in my enrollment papers.  Even though I didn’t have a great grasp on how big that amount actually was, I knew it was a lot.

**Tip #2 – Don’t expect magic to happen. You’re paying for it, so plan for it.**
Even though it felt like money just magically appeared into my bank account at the beginning of each semester, I knew I was going to need a non-magical way to pay that all back eventually. So I started from Day 1 to set myself up for success. I was interested in the humanities in high school, loved History and English, but I didn’t know any History or English majors that were making decent salaries. I had to look elsewhere. On the advice of my sister, I enrolled in a beginning course for a relatively new college at Penn State, called Information Sciences and Technology, in my first semester. I had no previous tech experience, nor did I really know what IST was about. I lucked out, though, and had such a great time in that class that I thought “I can do this.” And I did. I threw myself into networking, coding, databases, project management, organizational alignment, etc. and learned it all with no prior experience. I forced myself into being passionate about a subject that I never even thought about before college. Meanwhile, I made sure to still do what I was interested in, and added a second major, Political Science, to my plan. I worked with my advisors from the beginning to figure out how to get it done in four years, and I then did.

**Tip #3 – Make your loans your Number One Priority.**
Looking for a job during senior year was fun. I had worked hard throughout college, so I was in a good position with a high GPA, internship experiences, and a different and interesting background (“Poli Sci too? That’s cool. Why?”). I also admit to having the advantage of being a woman in a male-dominated field. In 2010, companies were (and I would bet, still are) pushing for diversity in their hiring practices. They couldn’t say that being a woman was advantageous for me, but I knew it was. People who are successful take advantage of opportunities presented to them. I can’t say whether it’s fair or not that I got a leg up on the competition for being a female, but it wasn’t something I was going to work against.  I interviewed with at least ten companies. I had in-hand offers from four. And, at the end of the day, I went with the highest paying offer. Career growth opportunities, job satisfaction, location, etc. are certainly all factors in making an employment decision, but I knew those loan bills were coming in, and I made paying them back my number one priority. So I took the paycheck. 

**Tip #4 – There’s nothing more significant/impactful to paying back debt than your income.**
To have money left over at the end of the month, you need to make more than you spent. The only ways to accomplish this are to spend less or make more. I absolutely made every day choices to lower my overall spending, from never having cable to taking the subway instead of a cab. I made sure that a lot of my little financial decisions were sound. None of that, though, compares to just having a whopping paycheck come in each month. The best thing you can do for your financial goals is to have an income to support them. It helped me to not feel like I was pinching pennies all the time. 

**Tip #5 – Current salary can dictate future salary + always look for a better opportunity.**
Related, I have found in my own experience, that my starting salary influenced all my future salaries significantly. I worked for two years at a big consulting firm, and got a raise each year. Using that as my benchmark, I was able to be picky, but open, to new job opportunities. For a while, any reasonable-sounding job sent my way via LinkedIn, I interviewed for. Once I found a company (through a networking connection) that was very compatible with my skill set, I was able to make the move to a new and better job, with a salary jump. I can tell you honestly, I could have a very similar job as I do right now for half of what I’m making now. In business, no matter what people say, a salary is used as an indicator of performance, and people will pay for what they perceive as value. I also made sure to **ask for more.** Remember, they want to get you for as little they can, but when they like you and want you, companies will give you more than you think they would. I always put out what I considered to be unreasonable requests, and yet, I never got “We don’t want you anymore. Never mind.” It’s always, “Well, here’s where we can meet you on that request.”

**Tip #6 – You are not your friends.**
Unfortunately, you didn’t get the easy button for life. Your parents didn’t pay your way through college, but all your friends’ parents did for them. UNFAIR. Or, your friends are always going to expensive dinners and eating out for lunch and just bought a new Ford Focus, and you want to too! You need to tell yourself “I am not them. I don’t have those luxuries. I don’t have a winning lotto ticket.” I, of course, dealt (and still deal) with that. Did I like driving the 2000 Dodge Intrepid with a broken seat, peeling paint, and a horrible screeching noise every time I locked the doors? Nope, but I drove it until it died. Then I bought a very sensible 2007 Honda Civic and plan on keeping that for ten more years. My friends can enjoy their awesome Mustangs and Focuses, and I will get along with my little economic car. I will be enjoying my new debt-free life. And that’s important to me. I’m not my friends so we don’t have the same goals. I don’t bother comparing my life to theirs. 

And finally,

**Tip #7 – Always ask yourself: “Do I want this more so much that I am willing to delay my future goals of: XXX”**
I have financial goals. They include(d): 

A)	Paying off student loan debt

B)	Affording a nice apartment

C)	Owning a home

D)	Paying for my future children’s college

E)	Retiring without financial worries

These are things that are important to me in my financial life. Times when I was trying to decide whether to make a purchase that didn’t fit my budget, I would try to ask myself if it was worth it to delay my timeline on those items. That would help me to put down those beautiful leather boots that I knew I would wear all the time and would definitely get a great value for. It would also empower me to say yes sometimes. I’ve now traveled to Europe: Italy, Ireland, Germany, Czech Republic, Norway. I feel ok about delaying my future home buying in order to experience something as amazing as travel. By thinking of your smaller financial decisions in context of those larger ones, it helps you to remember your priorities and logically evaluate whether it’s worth it to delay them. 

I hope this was helpful for some people who are working through their own pile of debt. Just remember, you will pay it off. It’s up to you on how fast you can accomplish it. 

**TL;DR:** If you sign up for a big bill, plan to pay it back, take advantage of opportunities, be your own advocate, don’t compare yourself to others, and remember your priorities. "

I want a 2 in 1 for the small and portable size as a ""tablet,"" but want the power to be able to run full windows. For these reasons I have been eyeing the SP4 and following this sub since its release.

A little about myself, I am currently a student in the medical field, but I just finished all courses and only have 2 internships left. I use my computer for note taking and studying, but that will be on a more limited base now. Otherwise I just surf the web mostly.

I was planning on getting the M3 or entry level i5. Recently I have been seeing posts about alternate options on the market, and am wondering if one of these maybe a better option for me, as they are generally less expensive for similar or higher specs (RAM, SSD, processor). I am wondering if I should go with something like the Dell XPS 12, Lenovo Miix 700, Lenovo Yoga 900, or another machine."

I just graduated college two days ago, and already she is making me feel like a failure for not having a job offer lined up and for ""doing nothing but sitting around all day."" She claims I've hurt her SO MUCH and been a horrible daughter and blahblahblah. I tried to stick up for myself just now and it went horribly. It ended with me hysterical in tears and her screaming, kicking things, telling me she doesn't even know this person I've become, and acting like she is 100% in the right here. 

Her perception of me is so messed up. She thinks I sit around all day? I just graduated summa cum laude two days ago. I work an intense internship almost 40 hours/week. For the last two years I did this and went to school full time. ""And I haven't seen a cent of that money!!"" Yeeeaaahh...it's my money. I worked for it. By the way, she doesn't work. She ""sits around all day."" Her trying typical day involves household chores, working out, walking the dogs...

I have been actively applying for jobs both in- and outside the company I'm at now. Nothing. I thought I might have been able to move into a position that just opened up in my department, but found out yesterday I basically have no chance. The reason why is no fault of my own. Now, after my internship ends at the end of the month, I'm going to be stuck at home with her without any personal income until I can find something else. It's hard to get a job right now, it seems, even with a degree.

She claims I'm so mean and disrespectful and hurtful to her. The projecting here absolutely blows my mind. I am not this person she thinks I am. I realized while she was yelling at me how much she truly resents me. I realized she doesn't unconditionally love me.

I wish I could escape this. My nmom controls my life. I feel extremely depressed and discouraged. I just can't do this anymore. I wish she had chosen not to have children. I don't think she deserves to be a mother."
3xacmp,3,2015-12-17,Question about which job to choose and future career effects. (Long post),gr00ve88,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3xacmp/question_about_which_job_to_choose_and_future/,"Hello Accountants,

I currently work (as a full time intern) at a small firm in NY.  I started in March this year and when I applied I told them upfront that I did not intend on staying with the firm as I have an offer from a top 10 public accounting company that I have already accepted.  Well, now its crunch time.  As I am preparing to leave, my last day being next week, the managing partner has reached out to me several times over the past few weeks asking me to stay as he thinks I am an excellent worker and I fit in very well with the firm.

Long story short, he made me a soft offer stating that he would definitely pay me more than my new job is offering.  Also noting that tax season hours are 56 hours **maximum**, whereas at my other job i'd be working 55 **minimum** and most likely closer to 80-90.  All other benefits would be the same as far as insurance and 401k matching etc.

My future career goals are to own my own small public firm (like the one i'm interning at).  But as a recent graduate (MBA &amp; passed CPA), I feel as though I will miss out on opportunities by NOT working at a bigger firm, especially it being my first job... however, I don't know if these thoughts are valid.  Working at this small firm, I could learn everything I'd need to open up my own place and my potential clients might not really care whether or not I have ""Big 4 Experience"".  And working at a smaller firm will help me be more diverse and learn more nuances than just cranking numbers onto a form at a large public company.

So basically my dilemma is I think I would have a better work life balance and be paid more my first year (not sure about how raises work around here or the other place) than if I worked in a large public accounting place... but on the other hand I feel as though I am missing out on other potential career paths by not working at a large firm.

So my question is, is not starting my career with a large public accounting firm detrimental to my long-term career in accounting? Is it reasonable to say maybe a few years down the line I decide I want to work for a bigger firm I won't have an issue finding a job? If I wanted to switch to private accounting, what kind of position am I in since I don't have large public firm experience?

Thanks"

Yes!
I wouldn't have gotten this without FCC. I am a senior computer science student, but this isn't why I got the internship. I started FCC because I had an ""Oh, shit!"" moment this summer, realizing that I have BS'd my way through my entire CS program and don't really know any coding at all and am not employable. Now, 4.5 months later, I'll be one of three interns starting in mid January. They said that as an intern I will be dipping into many different projects but will mostly be using JavaScript and Python, languages I have never used in school. 

How I got it: 

In the online application, they provided links for personal websites, projects, etc. I linked my portfolio that was the first zipline on FCC. On my portfolio I also have 6 projects I did through FCC, including the pomodoro clock, calculator, quote generator, etc. I don't think my website works correctly on anything but firefox, so I'm grateful that whoever looked at it was using firefox because they ended up calling me to set up an interview. 

The interview went pretty well. I bombed the question on prototyping, I said something like ""Prototyping involves inheritance..."" and you could tell that they were expecting more, but I drew a blank, and we moved on. Whatever. Otherwise, it went pretty well. Just kind of told them I'm really motivated and excited to learn as much code as possible. 

They did ask me about my lack(or non-existence) of Python experience, since the job does involve a lot of Python, and I just told them that JavaScript has been my primary focus but I still understand the core concepts of OOP that translate to all languages so I will have no trouble picking up Python. I think that was my ""make or break"" question. 

Anyways, starting in two weeks. I'm more nervous than excited, I hope I know enough to be useful. I know that this is a huge opportunity, so I've been coding non-stop for the last couple of days and probably will continue doing so leading up to my first day.

I realize it's not a full time career, so I still plan to keep using FCC for the projects to add to my portfolio. I will also continue to check the news section of FCC often, lots of interesting stuff is posted there.  

Also - this might be helpful to some people. Since my ""Oh shit!"" moment, I try to be as productive as possible on a daily basis. Prior to that I watched a lot of TV. Now, if I'm ever watching some random TV show like family guy by myself, I think ""This isn't making me a better person, I'm not learning anything useful, I could get on FCC right now and code. That's productive."" I cannot tell you how many times I've done this, and how many hours of coding directly resulted from that thought. Throwing that out there, maybe somebody else will get motivated to do the same. 


**TL:DR;** I got an internship. The first round of ziplines on FCC are what got me the job. That includes the portfolio, the pomodoro clock, quote generator, and the calculator. Uploading the portfolio to a legitimate hosting service with a URL was also imperative I think. I use godaddy.

3xb0mh,2,2015-12-17,[ROLEPLAY]Elevators,colin_000,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/3xb0mh/roleplayelevators/,"Johnathan hurried through the crowed, toward *Vickers International*. Towards work. A large building part of the Saigon skyline. He had recently gotten a job in Saigon from the company, and it was his only way out of the debt he had accumulated back in Pennsylvania. John entered the building in a hurry, scanning his card, and stumbled into a glass elevator.

""Excuse *me*, Sir."" Said a lady with an obnoxious British Accent. 

""I'm sorry, what?"" Replied John who was fumbling through some papers. 

""You spilled my coffee. Onto me."" Said the lady. 

John, his mind elsewhere, responded, ""Well thats a shame. Because it seems like your the type of person who *really* needs there coffee."" *Could this elevator ride go any longer?* John slowly took a few steps away from the woman, and bumped into a person. *People.* John thought angrily.  

""What do ye fookin think yer doin' mate?"" Said a tall, scruffy man behind him. 

""Oh sorry, I didn't notice you were there. Your awfully quiet and er... un-noticeable I guess."" John cringed at what he had just said. 

The man looked quite pissed off. The doors finally slid open, ""I... I should go now."" Said John, who stepped off, and waited for another elevator to take him to his next floor. 

John was already having a particularly bad day, but of course, it got worse. He was given the wonderful opportunity to present his 'work' to his boss. 

""I-er... "" John, paused, clearing his throat, ""I present a er-project that I have been working on."" John, with terrible odor and sweat literally dripping down him, hurried to turn on a slide-show. 

""Y-you see, here, I have something that I have been working on. I-if we were to produce this we could make it big on the marke-"" John was interrupted by his boss, sitting lazily at the table. ""I have been told repeatedly that the software is *fine.* Now, we are losing ground here and have budget constraints. No, I will not be giving your department a raise."" 

John stared at the man, he didn't even consider his ideas. He had already been working for months on concept art and story writing. The man looked at him like he was useless, talent less. 

John started to well up a little with tears, ""Sir, I'v-I've been working on this for a while. Please just look at what I have to offer. Look here, the story line would be brilliant! We could have a sort of space epic, it would inspire kids. I've already got the concept art laid out, a-and-"" 

""No. Go home, I've seen enough."" Said the man. The man acted like John was an annoying little twat. 

John nodded, tears welling in his eyes. ""Yes sir."" 

John pitied himself for the following afternoon. He wished he was more confident, maybe they would have listened to him. Maybe, in High School, if he would've just taken that internship, or actually took his chances with woman. He hated himself for not ever branching out and making friends. Sure, there was people he could talk too, but no one *really* ever considered him a friend. If he would've worked on those social skills early on- who was he kidding? Look at him, he was a loser. A virgin. Poor, with nothing to show for. And single. 

John stirred cream into his coffee, and stared into it. The past two years of work were crushed in an instant. John looked at Saigon as a place of opportunity, a new chance at life. But no, the same people ruled over him as before, giving him simple and plain work, with no where to go. 

He laid down, an irking stress pained him. What was he going to do? How long would he have to work with this company? What would they say about him? John laid restless as he had for many years before. 

This time, he had no more hope left in him. This time, he was practically pulling himself to the next morning. This time, he was a truly hopeless cause. "

You all seem nice and supportive so I figured I'd make an account just to post here. :) Sort of a throwaway but I might keep it around.

So, to keep things short, I'm AFAB and realized I am transgender about a month ago (after over a year of self reflection, examination, experimenting with labels, and experimenting with my gender performance)! Yay! This made me really, really happy, probably the happiest I've been in years. I felt like I found the missing part of myself. The first time I declared, ""I am transgender"" to my therapist I cried tears of joy. :')

A day passes and I'm still pretty happy, but quickly become depressed within a week. My baseline has changed from ""meh"" to ""happy,"" though. I smile when I think about being trans.

Then, I realize.. okay, so I know I'm trans. And trans is an umbrella term.

I'm trans, but I'm trans*what*? I have no idea. Up to this point, I had only heard about binary trans identities. Nonbinary was a very .. out there concept to me. Am I a transman? I don't know. When I think about being male, it makes me feel nauseous, and suicidal.. for some reason. I have no idea why. There's some little yellow flower of happiness in there, but it's so buried I can't see it. 

As for my identity: I guess right now I'm going with neutral because I'm figuring things out. I don't feel female but might feel male. I am 100% certain I am not female. 

To sum it up, my therapist has been a great help to me for over two years, for reasons unrelated to gender. But.. she didn't know the difference between gender identity and sexuality, misgendered and deadnamed her transman intern while telling me about him, and I feel that the two of us are at a strange point where she may not be able to help me anymore.

So, to end this rambling: does anyone have any resources to help me figure out the trans*what* part? I would like to see a gender therapist, but I am a very broke, poor, college student. The only reason I could see my current therapist is because my tuition already paid the fees.

Any advice is appreciated!!

Thanks!"
3xbfya,4,2015-12-18,No internet connection from Cisco router,TheOnionKnight1954,HomeNetworking,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/3xbfya/no_internet_connection_from_cisco_router/,"So I snagged a decommissioned Cisco 1841 router from work so I could learn how to set it up (I'm a network infrastructure intern, hoping I can eventually make a career out of this) and I'm having some issues getting internet connectivity.

The router is currently set up with an outside interface connected to the wall (which is wired to my cable modem, I have no physical access to my modem in my apartment), with a laptop connected to the inside interface. As far as I can tell everything is set up correctly. I can ping the modem both from my laptop and from the router, but no internet traffic can get out. NAT seems to be working as intended, interfaces seem to have correct IP's. Plugging my laptop straight into the wall works perfectly fine, as does my wireless Belkin router, so I'm not sure how this is any different or what could be causing the problem.

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this or if I should be taking this to /r/networking instead but this seemed like the appropriate place since this isn't really for an enterprise network.

If somebody has an idea of what the problem is, it would be greatly appreciated. I've been fighting this for almost a week now.

Config file: http://pastebin.com/zxiQah9i

Edit: Finally figured it out. After I added default routes like you guys suggested and it still didn't work, I remembered that I had to register the MAC address of anything that would be connected to the modem onto my account with my ISP. Once I did that, everything worked perfectly. Thanks a lot for the help!"

3xby4m,2,2015-12-18,I-Testify!,iQualityTest,softwaretesting,https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaretesting/comments/3xby4m/itestify/,"Today's world, where media is revolutionized by the internet, where protests are held by sharing relevant web-content supporting a cause, where amendments to the constitution is discussed more on the wall of a virtual world, than within the walls of our parliament, when the depth of ancient Indian culture is auctioned for videos like AIB Roast and feminism is misconstrued by MyChoice, I finally decide to raise my tiny squeak for being a ""Software TEST Engineer""  and to express the reality of my existence in this so called Corporate-Global-village. I could be alone about how I feel, I could be backed by many, but all that matters is, unfortunately ,this feeling now EXISTS.

A recent article ( again on a popular social networking site) spoke about how our Indian society compels you to be the BEST in whatever you do, yet do ONLY the things what everyone else is doing. It speaks about how you should follow a prototype life and deviating from it even by an inch would mean your blood is suddenly not red anymore and you are all of sudden a rebellious-Indian. There were times when people branded youth as MTV-[V]-Influenced youth!(sounds as-if some virus attacked these youth!). 

This article compelled me to think of all the times when I have wanted to do things differently. One such major thing was career. But when I had to make the choice, Software Engineers were the BEST in market. Remember? I am an Indian! I am suppose to be the BEST, and do what everyone else was doing and I DID. I did not rebel.

4 years of tear-eye-blurred letters on my Engineering textbooks landed me in a good-paying job in a product company. The job put me on testing Storage Area Networks(SAN). SAN in 2009 in India was equivalent to 2014-Sunny-Leone-Hot! Getting an opportunity to work on the hot property of the Storage Industry at the very beginning of my career, I welcomed it with open arms. I was TESTING SAN. I loved setting up the SAN infrastructure.I loved my work. I was a fresher and I had the liberty to make all the mistakes I could, to learn the system right. It never occurred to me that I was a ""TESTER"" in the making, more so in a product company. Nevertheless, I was reminded to be the BEST again and do what others of my-age were doing. Yes. Masters! I quit my job in 2011 to pursue my masters. 

During my masters I enjoyed courses related to Software Testing particularly. My internship involved testing SAN again and I was excited. I graduated. To prove that my blood was still Indian and that SRK's Swades had indeed made an impact, I came back to India. I again tried hard to be the BEST and earned myself a job. But again, in the Testing domain, because I loved it.  

But what happened in the Indian Software Testing Community during my absence, between 2011 and 2013 was.... an exodus from Manual testing towards Automation testing.
'SAN testing' in 2009 knew only one term 'SAN testing' which was MANUAL in every true sense.But those 2 years(2011-13) when I slogged day-in-day-out in my Masters, the Software Testing domain in the Indian subcontinent had migrated from Manual testing to Automation Testing. The skill-set acquisition phase was over. The automation framework was laid out. The freshers were trained on Automation. And now.. **Drum Roll Please** I was a Software Test Engineer,with 2 years of experience in Manual Testing, A Masters Degree,
with strong knowledge on SAN, extremely good with testing principles and more than everything, having A STRONG PASSION FOR SOFTWARE TESTING.**Slow Clap** But WITHOUT  a place for me in the industry as I have NO EXPERIENCE IN AUTOMATION!!!(and I AM NOT A DEVELOPER)
""HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE"" and even better ""WHY""!!! Should I ? 

May I now ask the Indian community to suggest the ways of making me the BEST in the industry?? Suggest ways to do what others are doing? 
1. Learn Automation? Check! I took classes. I am writing my own automation scripts. I learnt it. I am open to new learning!  Happy?!
2. Attend Interviews? Uncheck! I need a job on automation to gain experience. To get a job on automation I NEED EXPERIENCE.  It is a bloody dead lock! 
3. Become a Developer? UNCHECK! THANKYOU!

	* My classmates in BE who joined with me and got trained thoroughly as developers are my biggest competitors because I CHOSE TO LOVE MY TESTING JOB AS A FRESHER.
	* My classmates in MS have various roles to work for in the US. Thanks to my patriotism! In India you are either a Developer or a Tester! Correction--&gt; Automation Test Engineer!  
	* Seniors in the team who are hardcore programmers will be the interviewers and they look for ""EXPERIENCE"" as a DEVELOPER
	* And most important of all.. I DO NOT LIKE TO BE A DEVELOPER. Can the Indian Software Fraternity accommodate and respect this individual choice! 


My dear Indian Software Engineers, It is not about NOT having the capability to be a developer. It is the ""I DO NOT LIKE IT"" factor. Ohhh wait a sec! I am in India. I cannot express what I do not like. If I do, I am a rebel. I am suppose to somehow be the BEST. I am suppose to be doing what others are doing! Even if it means I DO NOT LIKE IT. 

Thinking from a broader perspective, when will this society ever understand that DISAGREEMENT is NOT EQUAL TO DISRESPECT.  MAKING A DIFFERENT CHOICE IS NOT DISRESPECTING THE BEST. IT IS BEING THE BEST IN SOMETHING ELSE. 
 We are Engineers. Software Engineers. Not programmers or testers!!  Let us respect the individual CORE COMPETENCY!
KEEP CALM and GROW UP! Broaden our horizon!

We don't know each other all that well. We met on an internship at this company, spoke a few times, and when the internship finished I gave her my number. Then she texts inviting me to the party. I got the feeling we kind of hit it off but in reality I'm not sure whether she sees me as just as a friend or not.

So...back to this party. It's at her apartment and even though we're in the same city chances are I won't know a single person there. My question is...how do I act? I like her and want to find out if the feeling's mutual, but a room full of strangers (her close friends, maybe even her family) doesn't seem like the ideal time or place to do that."

Times when no one is given the chance to calmly face a situation and think what they can do to solve it.*

*It is during those times that the commonfolk step aside. ""I can't save her."" said a doctor, far away from the battle at the Plague Jungles, struggling to keep his best friend's daughter alive, trying to help her survive the hit of a stray Avarosan arrow. ""I can't defend my homeland."" thought an old, old man, far away in time and space, while trying to look for a way of saving Urtistan. ""I can't conquer his heart."" thought a maiden, far away, in a beautiful watchtower that had been built ages ago in the very middle of Bandle City.*
*
It is during these times that heroes appear. When no one dares to try, they show up. That is the only difference between the commonfolk and the few heroes that have stumbled upon our world. That they decided to show up. They decided to act. They decided to show that they did have the willpower to do something.*

*Two words are enough to turn a common person into a hero: I can.*

Hi there! Nachokage here, introducing you the Fan-fiction I've been working on for the past year and ~2months.

This started with a piece of LoL-related text that I had to write for applying for an internship. Even though I didn't get the internship, I had a lot of support from the few people who had read that first piece ([the prologue] (http://nachokage.blogspot.com.es/2014/12/the-fall-0.html)). That, paired with my need to practice my writing while I worked on setting the world for what will probably be my first novel (it will take years though), helped me to start this project. Now, a year and more than 25.000 words later, this story is coming to an end.
 
The plot is centered around Runeterra's death; the land, corrupted, is being killed by the will of men. Anger, revenge, fear and despair lead humanity to an endless battle against magic itself. Only a few will realize what is really happening, creating bonds between characters that would have been impossible otherwise.

The last three chapters will be published in the next three saturdays (including tomorrow). Even though the main events come to an end with the last chapter published, these will serve the purpose of explaining how some things were orchestrated and put an end to the few plots that have been left open.

What can you expect from [The Fall] (http://nachokage.blogspot.com.es/p/the-fall.html)? It is a tragic story, with its own dose of romance for those who like it, filled with a lot of the League of Legends characters we all know and love ^(or hate). The mix is completed with a lot references based off well known fan works (like ZedXSyndra), Rock and Metal music, literature and more.

Here's the full list of published chapters. Note that the first 20-30 chapters include a short list of the featured champions  which is not added later on for avoiding spoilers:

* [Prologue: Dr. Veles Kozim's Daily Log] (http://nachokage.blogspot.com.es/2014/12/the-fall-0.html) features Zilean and LeBlanc. What's written here happens hundreds of years after the story as a whole has finished.

* [Chapter 11: Cling-clang go the chains](http://nachokage.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-fall-11.html) was published between the second and third part of Chapter 10 because I was having trouble when trying to write the Third part.

3xdrsi,2,2015-12-18,Girl not replying after first date,_Phantom08,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3xdrsi/girl_not_replying_after_first_date/,"So two weeks ago I met this girl during a rainstorm in a university campus,
she had an umbrella so I took the opportunity to talk to her by getting under 
her umbrella and introducing myself.  I ended up getting her number and
setting up the date the same night.  I'm a [20M] and she [19F] so it was finals 
the following week but she still texted back within hours or the next day.
The first date went really well I noticed that she almost never broke eye
contact, she kept smiling and we talked for almost two hours on a coffee date.
I admit I messed up a few times in the beginning with stupid things I said, 
but they didn't seem that big of a deal.  

So this was on a Saturday, the next Sunday I texted her and she
didn't reply.  This didn't worry me too much because she had her last final
the following Monday and was leaving back to her home from the University 
the next day on Tuesday.  So I suspected she might be busy cleaning her room
and getting settled back as well as she mentioned starting some new busy 
internship. 

That Wednesday I left her a voicemail similar to my text and I still
received no reply.  Now it is starting to worry me, but she had pulled 
something like this in the two weeks of knowing her when she didn't reply
for four days because she shut off her phone to study for finals.

Should I keep trying, and maybe send another text in a week or two, to
setup a date in January, or should I just stop trying?"

Amy, you are a strong competitor and also very cruel. How you made it to the final five still has me in awe. It would be a pleasure to send you home as well because it seems like a lot of people are tired of your presence.

3xf7tc,3,2015-12-18,I [22M] was too afraid to tell my GF [21F] of 2 years that I love her and we broke up. Too late to say I love you?,tobyruinseverything,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xf7tc/i_22m_was_too_afraid_to_tell_my_gf_21f_of_2_years/,"I started dating my girlfriend the second year of college, I was infatuated with her from the moment I met her. We have very similar values, senses of humor, both very adventurous, we both love skiing, beautiful, super smart, fun, basically she's the exact type of person I want to spend my life with. After about 2 years together, she broke up with me about a month ago stating that our relationship ""wasn't enough"". I felt totally caught off guard because I thought we were having just normal fights in a relationship, but she said she was tired and didn't want to fix it anymore. Looking back, I now realize that there were warning signs that I should've noticed and acted on.  

&amp;nbsp;

After I met her and we got to know each other, it took a long time to convince her to date me. We were basically ""dating"" for about 5 months without calling it that, but I told her that I needed to know one way or another if she wanted me in her life. She agreed and said she didn't want to lose me and she was just afraid. Her father was an alcoholic and just wasn't a supportive figure in her life, so I figured she was just a little slower to trust people and let them get close. Then I had an internship in her hometown this past summer and things seemed like they were going great. Lots of fun, great memories together, and I was just so thrilled to have her in my life every day. Out of seemingly nowhere, she blew up at me and asked if I came to her hometown just because of her. She said she didn't want to feel like she had to show me around and that I wasn't there for her the previous summer (she had an internship far away and I stupidly didn't visit her because we just started dating and thought it would be too big of a step). I was heartbroken cause all I could think was, wouldn't you want me to follow you where you were?  

&amp;nbsp;

I talked her down and things got better, then right before coming back to school she asked if we should just be friends. She said we would both be busy and she didn't know if this was what I wanted. Again I talked her down and we agreed to stay together. About 2 months into the year, we had a fight about something stupid and she said we should break up. 2 days later she comes to me crying and apologizing that she doesn't know why she always pushes me away, but she wants and needs me in her life. She said she just had trouble trusting people and she hated how she always pushed me away. I more hesitantly agreed after a long talk that I wanted her in her life and suggested she go to therapy and that I would go with her, but she said she wasn't ready to do that.  

&amp;nbsp;

So then back to the present, before we broke up she accepted a job far across the country from where I'll be. I wasn't sure how it was gonna work, but she said we could visit each other as often as possible. So then we broke up and now and I'm heartbroken. Through all of this, I realized I had never told her that I love her and I can't tell you how much I regret that. I realized that I had always trying to smooth over our problems instead of really fixing them, and that I had changed how I was acting. I had always been afraid that I liked her more than she liked me, so I had been too afraid to say it. I had tried to show her in as many ways as possible that I cared about her and thought about her all the time, but I had never said the 3 most important words in a relationship.  

&amp;nbsp;

I realize now that we probably just aren't the right people for each other at this time in our lives, but I just don't want to live with this regret. I still love her a lot and realize that with her moving away it probably never would've worked, but I can't help but hate myself for never saying it. Is it a bad idea to tell her that I love her and wish I could've said it sooner even if I don't think we can be together? I really hope to stay in touch with her even if just as a friend, but I'm afraid this could ruin it if she doesn't want to hear it now or thinks I'm groveling. Sorry for the long post, but it really helps just to write this stuff out.  

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr: Is it too late to tell someone you love them even after your relationship is over and there's no real hope of fixing it?"

All my life I been bullied, talk down on, disrespected, mistreated, etc. I'm so tired of it. Since middle school all the way to now, college. I'm 22 about to graduate college and to this day I let people walk all over me, I'm so tired of it. I want to be respected, I want people to value what I have to say, I don't want to look or feel stupid. I want to be considered tough, I want to speak up for myself, I want to be assertive somehow be a ""bitch"" because let's be honest, girls who have ""bitch"" attitudes are respected.



Relationships: 

Broke up with ex-boyfriend recently because he was taking advantage of me. After months of dating, he didn't want to introduce me to anyone. I was used for sex. This is not the first time it happens. Men just used me, treat me like shi. This is a pattern.
I'm so over dating! I want to work on myself, but I don't know how!

Work Wise:
-I worked at many jobs. The worst experienced I had been when a manager at a restaurant who always verbally abused and once told me that I'm mentally retarded because I was always making mistakes. I cried and quit the job. I didn't do anything about it. Wish I did at the time when I think about it I get angry for not standing up for myself. Wish I could go back and slapped the bitch or kill her. (won't actually do it lol.)

Another case was when another manager at a different job pushed me and yelled at me for no reason. Once again I didn't speak up, she apologized, though.

At some restaurant jobs, coworkers were also rude to me. Talking behind my back, yelling at me, calling me stupid, ignoring me.
Now I'm doing an internship at an office and people are much nicer. However when I think of the past and the way people treated me I get so mad at myself.

Family:
-I don't speak to my little brother who is 18. He doesn't respect me as the older sister. We got into a huge argument months ago in which he called me a ""WHORE"" ""a dumb bitch who can't keep a relationship"". Just awful things.
Social life:

-People that I considered friends often times make fun of me when in a group of friends. I'm not the type to stand up for myself so when I'm around a group of friends people often times make ""jokes"" and I laugh it off. I hate confrontations so I'm an easy target. I try to avoid groups.

-I meet this girl in small class this semester. She was nice and all. but recently she started acting like a bitch. When I participated in class she made rude remarks, faces, ignored me at one time called me stupid when I made a joke in class.


Is like people I meet think is okay to talk to me badly. Think is okay to ignore me. Talk down on me. I never stand up for myself. When I'm in a situation where I'm disrespected I freeze at that moment and don't say anything.either laugh it off or stay quiet. I also replay that scene over and over again wishing I could go back to time and change the way I reacted.

This is embarrassing because I'm already graduating college and I'm 24. I'm supposed to have my shit together, but clearly I need to work on myself. Therapy is not an option because I don't have money.

The reason I said life isn't fair is because is just one thing after another. Yes, I'm graduating college, which is the greatest accomplishment but everything else is bad. At this point of my life I  want to start over. This isn't where I want to be "

There's hiring quotas by companies and lots of scholarships for women entering the computer field. Companies offer internships that are easier to get specifically for women, and so forth.

Yet, never have I ever seen a feminist push for more women to get PhDs in computer or research so that they can make an actually notable contribution to society.

Why is this if equality is really a concern? Or is ""equality"" only okay when it benefits women?"
3xfgdp,2,2015-12-18,1- Anu Start,MattressCrane,1000aday,https://www.reddit.com/r/1000aday/comments/3xfgdp/1_anu_start/,"So it's been a very long time since I've last done this. Frankly I gave up in the summer, and I do regret it- I wish I stuck through with it. I just felt that after writing a 100, 000 words, I didn't get a single thing out of it. I mean, I learned it's going to take a whole lot more shitty writing to get to the good stuff. So, next year is coming around, and I'm a little too impatient to wait for New Years Resolutions to inspire me.

So here's how the new system is going to work instead. I don't suppose I'll uphold another *write everyday* quota- the times and days where I didn't write weren't inspiring- they made me feel like shit. I felt that I was failing myself. I don't like that, and the next year is going to be even busier than this one. So, what I would like to do is work off of a streak based idea. Number a story 1, the next day 2, then 3, and if I miss a day... Back to one. With that, at least the commitment to succession will still be there, and I won't feel nearly as beaten when I don't commit entirely. So, now I guess I can talk about what I'd like to write.

I'd like to focus more on screenwriting than prose. Prose can be fun, I like it now and then, but I find most of my ideas I envision for a cinematic feel, and also I just don't see me getting into a career where I write prose. So I don't have any new ideas now, but I'm going to do perhaps a day of thinking over an idea, then trying to write as much as I can on a frequent basis.

January-April I'm directing a short film, and that's going to be my full attention. The Book of Norman is just about done, and is in its final stages. I have an internship next semester too, and then after all that, I'm moving to Montreal. So time is short and I want to make it count- after all these little projects here and there, there should always be a factor moving forward. Slowly, sluggishly at times, but it has to keep moving. I haven't written any *new* stories this semester. So, now's the time. I have more *free* time, time to work on any projects during the day, without infrequent deadlines, so I know sparing an hour everyday for this shouldn't be out of the question.

More work is always good. Self deprecation is not. "

Also I don't have a comp sci degree (civil engineering), have multiply foreign citizenships (not sure if this helps or not), speak Cantonese, English and Mandarin fluently.


**A few questions for programmers in HK, would you recommend someone fresh out from uni to purse a software development career in HK? (Any Cons I should be aware of?)**


Also, I assume once a programmer is competent enough and have had a few years of experience, it is easy to try relocating somewhere else in the world? (just for travel exploration or better pay) Maybe someone can correct me if this assumption isn't true.

3xhgy8,430,2015-12-19,[UPDATE] I [20M] have started working at a new internship that I have worked hard for. My gf [20F] of two years is jealous. I'm feeling annoyed. Advice?,yyuyuthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xhgy8/update_i_20m_have_started_working_at_a_new/,"Almost nobody will remember the post I made [about 6 months ago] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3748b2/i_20m_have_started_working_at_a_new_internship/).  However perhaps someone will get some amusement out of hearing an update or a story about how a couple worked it out.

Oh, what a difference open communication and some hustle can make!  Half a year ago I was beginning an internship at a large financial firm with seemingly good career prospects after graduation.  My girlfriend Jill was jealous because of my prospects and achievement (even if it was just an internship).  I was upset that she was jealous because I believe it implied entitlement and a lack of empathy.

After I asked you guys for help my emotions were curbed.  I set aside a time to talk about our position.  In that conversation or one that followed (to be honest I don't remember the fine details) she laid it all out on the table.  She wasn't quite happy with where she was in her career (or rather, her preparation for a career).  She felt she wasn't learning all she wanted to in her classes, and she was jealous of the ""hard"" skills I was learning while hers seemed to be largely conceptual.  From that conversation it all made sense.  It's never about what it's about.  It wasn't about me at all.  My own insecurities manifest themselves in different, seemingly irrational ways.  This was simply her manifestation.  After talking more, understanding and such, I offered to explore career paths with her.

After a bit of research and talking to professors Jill has officially applied and been accepted to the Supply Chain Management concentration of Marketing at our University.  Logistics management is growing very quickly, with high career prospects, and the program at my school is good.  She has excelled in her supply chain classes this semester (giving ""one of the most in depth, prepared presentations I've seen given in this class"" according to her professor) and she continues to build her network and is currently in contact with several recruiters to prepare for her internship hunt this February.  She really enjoys her classes and is *excited* to start internship hunting.

Meanwhile I have continued to build my skills and network and last month I have accepted an internship at a prominent accounting compliance and consulting group at a rate of &gt;$30/hr with a sizable signing bonus.  After college prospects are overwhelming good, and I'm very excited for my future.  Her reaction has been overwhelmingly positive and accepting.  Her only concerns are for my work life balance (which *does* suck if reputation is to be believed) and ending up in the same city together.  Both concerns are taken care of as most entry level employees of this organization usually work for only 2 or 4 years before jumping ship to project management or team management at a company in industry.  Things couldn't have worked out better.

The biggest takeaway is that I probably do have better career prospects at this point in time.  We have continued to find differences between us.  I've also learned that she is a way better cook than me and ironically better at home finances and budgeting.  She has a better time connecting with people.  And that's okay.  Just being with her has made me a much more ambitious, kind, and better person.  Sorry to get all mushy and shit, but things are great!

**tl;dr: My girlfriend was jealous of my success despite herself and I found myself resenting her for it.  We talked it out and found the root of her insecurity and mine.  We developed a plan and she has significantly improved her situation while I have continued to grow.  We are both very happy for each other.**

*EDIT: I forgot to address an important part of this update.  Since then I have addressed why I reacted a little harshly to her jelousy.  I believe it to be ego.  Since then I have made conscious efforts to stay humble and focus on helping people.  Jill continues to inspire me in that way, she really has made me a better person.  SPOILER: I was a bit of a prick in more ways than one before I met her.*"
3xhl5u,12,2015-12-19,Me [25M] with my GF [23F] of 1.5 years does not respect my money situation,durant0610,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xhl5u/me_25m_with_my_gf_23f_of_15_years_does_not/,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. A little backstory on me: I'm 25 years old, and currently senior in college. I did not go to college when I graduated high school, but decided at the age of 22 that I wanted to get my degree for the sake of my career/future. I will graduate this May with a computer engineering degree with a job lined up starting at ~$75k, but for the time being money is extremely tight, as I have had to pay all of my bills (rent, electricity, insurance, phone etc) throughout my entire college career and have had to work 25-30+ hour weeks to afford it. I currently have an internship near my school, and due to scheduling this semester (and probably next semester) I can only work ~16 hour weeks. It pays well but I have been short 2 months this semester, and had to borrow money from my brother to pay bills. I don't have money to give a lot gifts or take her out to fancy dinners.

On the other hand, my girlfriend is currently working part time in a retail store. She lives by herself, but her parents still pay for her car insurance, phone, and her parents own the place she lives so she does not have to pay rent, so her monthly expenses are fairly low, but she also doesn't really make much. 

Throughout our relationship, I've done my best to keep the relationship fresh and come up with fun date ideas that I can afford probably 3-4 times a month, and when I take her out to eat its always relatively cheap about twice a month (think ~$10-$15 a head local sit-down restaurant, not McDonalds). 

The relationship has been pretty healthy up until recently. Very minimal arguing, she seemed to understand my situation and didn't really have a problem with it. In the past month or two, she has been making a lot of comments about how much she wishes I would surprise her with flowers and take her out to a expensive, fancy dinner date and that I never give her gifts. Any fun (and cheap) activities I plan seem to be met with somewhat begrudging attitude, but she does seem to enjoy it once we got started.

This Thursday I drove home to see my family, and plan on staying with them through Christmas, but before I left I picked her up and took her for breakfast. I plan on coming back to work full time until school starts, which means I would be here for New Years. She suggested for New Years that I take her out to somewhere expensive where we can get dressed up, and come back to share a nice bottle of wine together. I told her I don't know if I could afford that, especially since its Christmas and I had saved up what little money I could for gifts (including for her) but I would do what I could. Her response to this was ""If we can't go somewhere really nice for New Years I'm going to be pissed."" I told her that was a really shitty thing to say, and that it makes me not want to do anything for her, let alone something expensive. She immediately apologized and said she didn't mean it like that. I took her home shortly after and drove to my parents house (8 hr drive) and through the drive she was texting me apologizing frequently. 

Her comments like this make me feel somewhat inadequate and seems to be driving a wedge between us. I know she isn't asking for these types of things to happen on a monthly basis or anything, but just on special occasions maybe two or three times a year, but even then I just don't have an extra $100 to drop on one dinner and flowers or a gift before I graduate. We have talked about this in the past and she still makes these types of comments. How should I handle this? Is this something that justifies ending a relationship?

**tl;dr**: I'm dead broke and still an undergrad in college even though I'm 25 and my girlfriend is started to get fed up with the fact that I never take her out or buy her nice/expensive things. What should I do?"
3xicjg,1235,2015-12-19,I Cheated on my Boyfriend at Work. [F/F],verybadmanager,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/3xicjg/i_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_at_work_ff/,"I’ve changed some details about this because I could get in a lot of trouble if it came out. For that reason I might not answer too many questions. Well I won’t be too specific with my answers at least.


My name's Helen I’m a very normal person really. I’m outgoing and like normal stuff, and I have an outgoing boyfriend who likes normal stuff too. We both exercise a lot together and we’re both in good shape which is something important to both of us. But other than that we’re like any couple. Our sex life is fine too, and the only complaint I have is that he doesn’t go down on me nearly as much as I would like. But it’s not a big problem really. All in all we’re very happy, we live together, and are planning a future. So I never thought of myself as a cheater, which is why it’s so weird to me that I’m writing this. Part of me writing this is because I want to share something with a subreddit that I have enjoyed for a few months now (made an account for this!), and part of it is to get it all off my chest because it's been a weird few weeks.


I work in a big open plan office in a city centre, and my job is quite fast paced and hectic. I like my job and I take my career very seriously, so I’m always looking for ways to further my ‘professional development’. Well a few months ago my company was putting a call out to anyone who would be willing to manage an intern and I thought I’d go for it. Not something I’d done before and a good opportunity. I had to interview quite a few applicants and eventually settled on this girl called Izzy, who was 21 and had just graduated from uni (I’m 25 btw).


Izzy is short and slim, with wavy blonde hair and a very pretty face. I’m completely straight so didn’t really think anything of it, other than in a ‘*Oh she’s quite pretty*’ kind of way. I feel weird talking about myself, but for reference I think I’m somewhat good looking too. I’m slim and tall with straight blonde hair and small boobs. Guys have said I’m ‘too skinny’ quite a lot, but it’s never bothered me. My face isn’t as pretty as Izzy’s but I scrub up okay!


Anyway, Izzy fit in with our team really well which was great. She started a bit over 2 months ago and we got along pretty well from the start. Part of my responsibility as her line manager is to schedule our weekly 1-to-1 catch up sessions to see how she's getting on. Like I said my office is big and open, but in the middle to one side there is a row of little meeting rooms you can book if you want to make some calls or have a quiet conversation. The rooms are big enough for a fairly deep desk on one wall (with side panels) and a couple of chairs. The walls are semi sound proof, and they each have a big window that looks over the city. The only inside window is at head height in the door so you can check if anyone’s in there.


About 1 month in Izzy and I were having a catch up. We were going through some stuff on my laptop and it was going very normally. I’m a really talkative person so all our meetings have a lot of joking around and chit chat in them. But today I was a bit off because I’d been arguing with my boyfriend that morning. It was just about sex stuff but it put me in a bit of a downer for the whole dat. Izzy could tell and asked me what was up, and I told her I’d been arguing with the bf. That moved the topic onto boyfriends, and she told me she had recently broken up with hers.


I didn’t mean to pry but I suppose I did anyway and asked what had happened. She kind of brushed the question off at first, but then told me that actually it was the sex. Her face went super red which made me laugh but it wasn’t really awkward at all because I’m not very shy about that stuff and Izzy knows it. I considered being all professional about it and getting the meeting back on track, but truth is that it was nice to talk about all that crappy boyfriend stuff with someone new. Plus we had a halfhour left in the room and had completed our agenda. (Plus it was a friday afternoon!)


Turns out she had confessed to her boyfriend that she was bicurious and he didn’t take it well, and things went downhill after that. She asked me if I had ever had any experience or advice with it because she was finding it a bit hard to decide what to do about it. Obviously I said ‘No’ because I’m straight and didn’t have any idea, but I said that she definitely shouldn’t feel bad about it. To try and even up the exchange I confessed that my bf troubles had been about sex too. My boyfriend and I hadn’t had sex in a couple of weeks and he wanted to know if there was something wrong. I'd admitted to him that I’d been feeling neglected about the lack of oral, but that just made him get really defensive.


I kind of realised at this point that our conversation had gone waaaaaay over the line of what is okay. Yes we are both adults, but I am her manager and she is an intern. I was about to suggest we pack up and leave the room go join our team, but Izzy gave me a friendly frown and said ‘That sucks, that’s exactly the kind of thing I’m looking for’. I think I must have gone white when she said that or something because she apologised straight away and started waving her hands. I felt bad because I didn’t want to make her feel awkward so I laughed and said ‘No no it’s fine, it makes perfect sense!’


We kind of had one of those weird moments then. Where you’re both looking at each other but your expressions don’t change for ages. She kept looking at me and eventually said ‘I wish I could find someone laid back who wants what you want, that would definitely make things easier’. I think I knew what she was hinting at straight away, but I didn’t really know how to reply, so I just kind of smiled and nodded. After what felt like a long time she shrugged and said in a jokey voice ‘Well if you’re ever in the market just let me know’. I really don’t know why I didn’t shut it down right then, or try and laugh it off or something, but I didn’t. It hit me then that I was sat in a room with someone who was basically asking to go down on me, and I got really excited. It’s weird, it wasn’t like being horny or anything, just really excited, like getting to the top of a rollercoaster. If I’m honest I enjoy the thrill of ‘taboo’ stuff quite a lot so I think that was part of it. I kind of chuckled and looked at my imaginary watch and said ‘well I’m free for the next twenty minutes!’ in a jokey way.


I said it because it sounded like a joke. I meant it as a joke, and it was a joke. It seemed like a good way to give us both a way out of a weird situation. But part of me really hoped she didn’t take it as a joke because I wanted to see how far it would go. Also, I won't lie, the thought of getting some oral was genuinely starting to push my buttons, even though it was a girl. But it was all hypothetical because it wasn't gonna happen. Right? Izzy laughed a bit in response, but then looked at me and asked ‘Er... are you serious?’. Holy shit. Before I had time to think I just shrugged and said ‘Well, sure. I mean why not? It's not like it has to be a big deal’. It felt like an out of body experience where someone else was talking and not me. I would never have said anything like that, but then I actually did. Even now when I think about the moment I said that, it still feels like it was somebody else.


Izzy looked pretty shocked and I thought for a terrifying moment she had been joking all along. I thought about getting reported to HR and being fired and explaining it to my boyfriend and having to find a new job. But after about 5 seconds she said ‘Well… uh... if you’re sure, that would be great. I mean, I’d really like it. But in here? I mean, like now? Did you mean now?’ . She was serious. It was probably suuuuper awkward in that tiny room with just us two, but I think we were both too caught up in the craziness to notice.


I looked up at the ceiling trying really hard to look like I was casually working out the logistics when I was actually just thinking ‘*Oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god*’. My heart was beating so hard I could see it in my vision. Was I really trying to hook up with another girl at work? After pretending to think for a bit I said ‘Yeah, it’ll be fine. I mean, we’re pretty tucked away in here. No one ever comes in if the door’s closed’. Izzy breathed out slowly, nodded and said ‘Okay. Cool’. She had gone from red to white and back again several times by this point, and had this frightened smile on her face, which is probably the same thing I had on mine. We kind of sat there for a bit not looking at each other. Eventually she laughed and said ‘Wow… I did not expect this to happen when I got up this morning’. I laughed too and said ‘Hey me neither! This is definitely not a normal Friday for me’. We were quiet for another few moments when Izzy looked at me and said ‘So how do we, you know... go for it? Shall we just do it? Is there anything we should do first? I'm kind of new to this obviously, so yeah...’. I couldn’t believe it, we were both being deadly serious.


I crossed my legs super casually at this point to try and look relaxed, and as my thigh and pelvis shifted I realised that I had gotten pretty damn wet. I kind of freaked out at that moment because I was getting wet over a girl. But that fact also really turned me on even more. I tried to rationalise that it was the situation and not the girl, but the result was the same either way. I tried to think again, and realised that if we were going to do this we’d have to have a backup plan in case someone looked in the window or opened the door. It was super rare that anyone did, but I wasn’t going to take the risk. I was wearing a dark knee length dress with nude tights which made things a bit easier, and I realised we could use the desk too. At that point I kind of mentally slapped myself and this inner voice said ‘*Dear god Helen what the fuck are you even thinking?*’. I froze up for a moment, and realised I couldn't go ahead with it. But before I could backpedal, the other part of me just went with it.


So I looked at her and said ‘Okay, I've got an idea. I’ll go to the toilets, and while I’m gone you can get under the desk. If someone comes in while I’m gone you can just pretend you’re looking for something you dropped.’ She nodded. Then I said ‘When I get back I’ll come in and shut the door and sit down. I won’t say anything and I’ll just pretend to work on my laptop. Is that okay?’ Izzy nodded again. I said ‘You sure you’re okay Izzy?’ and she smiled and said ‘Yeah definitely, really okay. Are you definitely okay?’. I nodded and smiled back and we ended up staring at each other for a few pleasantly weird seconds again. Eventually I was like ‘Right, cool, see you in a bit I guess!’. I was trying to sound really normal so she wouldn’t see I was about to pass out from nerves, but it was probably obvious. I stood up as calmly as I could, picked my keycard off the desk, my bag off the floor, opened the door, walked out, and closed it again.


The walk down the middle of the office to the door at the end was incredibly slow, and all I could think about was Izzy behind me crawling under that desk. I felt like everyone was watching me but I know they probably weren’t. One of my friends in another department saw me and waved, and I nearly blanked her before giving her a forced smile. She asked if I was okay and I just said I was busy, which she understood.


Eventually I got to the door and opened it, and walked round the corner to the toilets. I was thankfully alone, walked straight into a cubicle, locked it, and took a moment to think about what I was doing. I didn’t want to leave Izzy waiting for ages and it already felt like a long time had passed (though it had probably been about 30 second), but I was starting to freak out a little bit. I had a boyfriend, and I wasn't even bi. I wasn't actually going to do this was I? I nearly unlocked the door and left, but I didn't. Without really thinking too much I lifted my dress up, slid my shoes off, and slipped my thumbs into the waistband of my tights. My hands were actually shaking, but ignored it, and pushed them down. It felt sooo naughty and wrong and scary to actually do that. I balled my tights up and shoved them under all the crap in my bag.


Then I lifted my dress back up to do the same with my panties. I stopped again with my thumbs in the waistband, because I knew this was the point of no return for me. If I was willing to sneak my panties off in a toilet cubicle, I was probably going to go all the way. I took a breath, and pushed them down. I like to keep everything hair free down there, and as soon as the fabric came away from my skin the cold air felt really intense. I tried not to look as I pulled them off so I could pretend nothing was happening, but as soon as I tried to ball them up I could feel how wet the fabric was in the middle. And after I stuck them in my bag I had to wipe my hand off with toilet paper. I still couldn’t believe what I was doing. It still felt like someone else doing everything. I was on a kind of weird autopilot. I slipped my shoes back on, picked up my bag, and left the cubicle. I was going to walk straight out but then I stopped by the paper towel dispenser and pulled a wad out and stuck them in my bag. Some weirdly logical part of my brain was like ‘*My intern will probably need these after she goes down on me*’.


I headed back to the office. It felt like ages but I had probably been gone only a bit more than one minute. I swiped back in, and started walking as normally as I could back to the meeting room. In my head I was sure everyone was going to notice that I had no tights on and ask about it. They were nude so I figured I’d just lie and said I hadn’t been wearing any, but of course no one actually did ask. I was trying to look calm, but before I got ten steps in I could feel my wetness going everywhere each time my thighs slipped past each other. My dress was really thin and I was afraid it would stick to my legs so I tried moving my legs as little possible and prayed no one would notice.


After the longest seconds of my life I approached my meeting room. I started to slow down a bit because I didn’t feel ready, but I knew I couldn’t just stop outside the door. I took a deep breath as I got up to it, and my heart was pounding again. Half of me was praying that Izzy wouldn’t be in there, that she had freaked out and gone back to our team’s main desk, and that we could pretend none of this had ever happened. But the other half knew I’d be bitterly disappointed if that happened. I put my hand on the handle and opened the door as casually as I could. I stepped into the room and closed it on the other side. The sudden silence was terrifying and exhilarating. I set my bag on the desk and dropped my card next to it. My heart was thudding again as I looked around the room. Izzy had moved her chair out the way so only mine was by the desk, and when I realised that her notepad and pen were still on the desk I had to let out a long breath to calm down. She was under the desk. I couldn’t see her but she was probably there. She was waiting under the fucking desk.


I pulled the chair a short way out to sit down on it, forcing myself not to look down in case I saw her expectant face. I kept my legs together as I sat down as close to the edge of the chair as I could, and remembered the cum on my legs as I did so. I pulled the back of my dress up as I sat down to avoid getting it wet, and kind of draped it around the seat of the chair so hopefully no one would notice if they came in. I could feel the coarse seat cover on my bare skin, and felt suddenly self conscious about having no underwear on. My head was a mess at this point and I couldn’t think straight. I pulled up a random spreadsheet and started clicking on cells for no reason, just trying to look busy in case someone burst in. My legs were gently pressed together and I sat rigid like that, pointlessly scanning numbers on the screen. Several agonising moments went by like this. I realised with a wave of relief and disappointment that she had probably gone. I had been sat there freaking out for like 15 seconds and nothing had happened. I would just get up and go back to my desk and we'd forget all about it.


Then I heard a quiet sound as Izzy repositioned herself under the table. '*Holy shit this is going to happen, I can't fucking believe this is going to happen*'


I started to breathe quite heavily, trying to calm myself down a bit. Nothing happened for a few seconds, and then I felt her hand on my knee and froze. This was actually happening. She put her other hand on my other knee, and gently pulled them apart. I resisted at first, but only for a second. She kept pushing them wider really slowly, and I was staring at the laptop screen thinking ‘*Oh my god Izzy can see my pussy right now*’.


Then, when my legs were pretty far open, I felt one of her hands slide up my thigh. I kind of shuddered involuntarily because it felt so intense, and she paused for just a moment. She must have seen that I was really wet, because she started running a finger over the slippery patch on my inner thigh. This went on for maybe a minute or so, and my cum must have been everywhere. I was incredibly horny by this point. Not just asexually excited like before, but full on dripping-wet horny. Eventually she stopped, and I felt her hair brush against my skin as she leaned in. Oh my god I can’t tell you the anticipation I was feeling right at that moment. I could feel how close she was because her breath was warm. My mind was just going ‘*Shit shit shit shit shit*’. She pushed my thighs a little further apart, her clothes rustled as she leaned in, and I knew she about to go for it.


I thought of my boyfriend for just an instant, and then I felt Izzy’s warm, firm tongue push gently into my pussy. My whole body quivered and curled. My skin got really hot and I had to close my eyes and clench my fists to not have an orgasm right there. I could feel the muscles in my groin tensing up repeatedly, and her cheeks felt slippery against my thighs. All I could think was was ‘*holy shit I’m at work and my intern’s tongue is inside me*’. Izzy curved her arms under and over my legs and pulled my hips gently towards her as she licked all the way up between my lips in one go. I curled up again when her tongue went over my clit and it took all my strength not to moan. She pulled her face away for a moment and I heard her gulp quietly under the desk. That nearly sent me over right there. I had no idea why I was so into this even though it was a girl, but I didn't question it.


Then she leaned forward again, and started lapping at my pussy slowly but firmly. I can’t tell how you good it felt. Nothing has felt so good before or since. I couldn’t think anymore, all I could do was hold on. If someone had actually looked through the window in the door they would have sussed it out in three seconds. I was sitting at the desk with my head back and my eyes closed, shuddering rhythmically to the soft squelching sounds of Izzy's face buried between my legs. I don’t think I even lasted 30 seconds. There was this kind of white hot feeling between my legs and a ragged breath came out of my mouth as I had the stickiest, shakiest orgasm of my whole life. For a few long moments I could have been anywhere. It was just one long wave of pure, eye-watering ecstasy. I wanted to scream and cry and tell her how fucking good it felt, but I wouldn’t have even been able to make the words. Apparently I managed to stay pretty quiet, but I have no idea how as I’m quite loud usually.


The whole thing probably lasted no more than 10 seconds, but they were 10 seriously good seconds. When it was over I just slumped back in the chair with my eyes closed trying not to fall off. My breathing was deep and heavy, I could feel sweat on my forehead, and my still open legs were just kind of shaking about. Eventually I lifted my head up, and opened my eyes. Izzy was kneeling between my legs with her mouth open and a look of wonder on her face. It’s good she doesn’t really wear makeup because my cum was everywhere. Her cheeks were shiny with it, and there was a thin strand of it connecting her chin to her shirt. She had put her hair back in a ponytail, but it was sticky at her temples. I smiled at her and she beamed back at me. She asked me if it was good, and I laughed. Then she said ‘Did you… you know?’ And I just nodded happily because I couldn’t really speak.


With the moment passing I realised how amazingly ridiculous this would look to someone else, and I pulled the paper towels from my bag. I kept a couple for myself and handed a few to Izzy. We both stayed where we were, wiping up my cum for a minute or so. Watching a girl wipe my cum off her face was seriously surreal. When we were done I stuffed the towels in my bag and Izzy got up and sat back down in her chair. I scooted back a bit to inspect the damage, and saw a predictable wet patch on my chair. Luckily it wasn’t too big and I guess Izzy got most of it. I looked over at her and we shared a giggle. Half of me was deliriously happy on a post orgasm high, and the other half was reeling from the knowledge that I had just cheated on my boyfriend and gotten eaten out by a girl. What. The. Fuck.


Once my legs were up to the challenge I got up and inspected my dress and was relieved to find no visible blotches. I perched on the table’s edge and looked over at my partner in crime. ‘So… How was it?’ I asked. ‘Yeah’ she said with a massive smile ‘Pretty much everything I was hoping for’. That made me really happy for some reason. I really liked that she liked it too. She pulled her hair band off and said ‘Do you regret doing that?’. I thought about it for a moment and was really really surprised to find that I didn’t. I know it was wrong and bad and everything, but honestly I’d be lying if I said I felt any regret. I looked at her and said ‘No, I don’t. It was honestly the best I’ve ever had. Which is really weird ‘cause you’re a girl’. She smiled again and thanked me, and I just laughed. This girl had just given me the best orgasm I’d ever had and then said thank you.


I checked the time and we still had about 15 minutes left. We made sure we looked presentable, and got our stuff together (which included me finding my emergency panties and slipping them on). I fake spilled my cold cup of coffee on the chair, and we got up, opened the door, and strolled out into the noisy and busy office that had been a couple of feet away the whole time. Izzy went to go wash her face while I took the chair to the front desk and apologised to the facilities manager (the building has a central cleaning service for things like coffee spills).


I went and sat down at my desk and Izzy came back a few minutes later, gave me a quick smile and sat down to her work. After an hour or so my friend sat next to me actually did ask if I had been wearing tights earlier. I gave her a mildly confused look and shook my head, and she and said ‘oh right - sorry, it’s obviously been a looong week! Can’t wait for the weekend.’


The last couple of hours of the day were super normal. Every now and then I would get this weird sensation come over me and would stop in my tracks and think ‘*oh my god I came on a girl’s face*’ but I’d shake it off and it was fine. Oddly enough the guilt never really set it. Don’t get me wrong I know I cheated on my boyfriend and he didn’t do anything to deserve it. But even though my brain knew it was wrong it just felt different because it was another girl. I don’t think the gender makes any actual difference, but for some reason it just felt different. I have been propositioned before by guys (once or twice when my bf and I were in a rough patch) and I never considered cheating because the thought of it made me feel terrible. But one proposition from a curious girl and my legs are open within ten minutes. Go fucking figure.


I got home that night expecting to be really awkward around my bf, but it was fine. We both apologised to each other and made up and some really loving sex. He even went down on me which I really appreciated, and everything has been great since. Do I feel gay or bi now? Not really no. Do I still feel straight? I think so. I’m not really sure to be honest. It’s all so unfamiliar.


As for Izzy… I do have more to talk about, but I didn’t want to write it out here because this is already so long. I didn’t mean for it to be but I just kept going. Haven’t written anything this long since uni! Feels really good to write it out though. If you want to tell me off for being a cheat then go for it. But if someone enjoys it like I have enjoyed other stories here than that’s cool too. x


**EDIT: I just wanted to make a little edit to say 'holy shit'. I did not expect to get this much attention. It's been really good to be able to talk about this, so thank you everyone. I'm thinking about how to write up more, but no promises when I'll be done!**"
3xihyf,12,2015-12-19,"SV: For the first time I can remember, I'm a normal weight.",Engrasmac,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/3xihyf/sv_for_the_first_time_i_can_remember_im_a_normal/,"16 M 5'10'' SW:215, CW: 174, GW: 160ish

Ever since I was a little kids, I've been self-conscious about my body. Whether it was feeling ashamed to take off my shirt at the pool with some of my friends because I was the chubbiest kid there, or wearing clothes that I had bought relatively recently and had become tight soon after, I had known I was fat.... But I chose to ignore it. I was the kid who took 20 minutes to do 3/4ths of a mile in gym class, after which the teacher would let me off because I was slow, and class was almost over, I was the guy who couldn't keep up with the other kids interns of athletics, I was the shy fat kid. Through middle school, too, I was obese. However, I still didn't feel fat, even when I knew deep down I was, and I portrayed that in my shy behavior. I, as I became fatter and fatter, slowly became more and more shy and introverted, preferring to keep to myself and my few friends instead of being more outgoing and outspoken.

It took me a while to see what I had become. At first, I realized I was fat, and I tried to get in better shape. It worked, at least a little. I lost 7 pounds, and then kept it off, and stayed at 208 pounds. I was doing kickboxing, loving it, but still eating a lot. But then summer and the finals before them happened, and I fell off the wagon, going back up to my max of 215 pounds. I tried so much to lose weight, before falling off the wagon, and then trying to get back on. I started out with just eating less (without tracking), and that didn't work, so I thought to myself that I would never lose weight, and I gave up. I then heard about myfitnesspal and tried that (but without measuring food, just guesstimating). That didn't work. I tried keto ( but without tracking calories). They never worked. So I finally resigned myself to never losing weight, but I was still subscribed to r/loseit (admittedly on a different Reddit account, to which I have now lost my password). All of this trying, along with other pressures, led me to a break down a day before going to start an internship with my uncle where he works, where I broke down about feeling worthless and feeling like shit - how I had tried so many times to lose weight, but it had never worked. I, however, decided to go to the internship despite feeling like shit, which eventually led me to where I am now.

My uncle, coincidentally worked as a doctor at a hospital, and my internship was to shadow him. While I was there, I did what I did before - I drowned my sorrows in food, eating more and more. Any weight I had lost from before all came back. However, one day, my uncle went to see a patient, who turned out to be someone who was morbidly obese (500+ pounds), and had to get a tracheostomy to be able to speak and breathe, which was why she was in the hospital. Even while she was in the hospital and getting surgery to help her survive, however, she was still eating so much, and had her family bring or sneak in snacks so that she could eat them. When I was with my uncle at that time, I had just picked up a bag of jolly ranchers, and was happily munching on them, savor in the flavor. After I saw the patient though, I went to one of the bathrooms, threw out the jolly ranchers, and looked at myself in the mirror - I saw how much my gut was sticking out, how my recently bought pants had already gotten tight, and how I had a double chin, and that point, after trying what must have been more than 30+ times before, I decided to lose weight. So I went home after the internship was over, and weighed myself. I was still 215 pounds, but I didn't think of that as slightly overweight now - I thought of that as almost to 250 pounds, which was halfway to 500, and then I might have had to get the same surgery for myself. So, I downloaded myfitnesspal, input my weight, and started counting calories again - but this time accurately, and I measured how much I ate at at each meal strictly.

I never thought I would be here, but I am. I've lost 41 pounds, and am now 174 pounds, which is, just barely, a healthy weight.  I did this how I said above - I tracked my calories accurately in myfitnesspal, and made sure to never go over my limit - to me, it would have felt like I had give up, and I couldn't.   So I set myfitnesspal to lose 2 pounds a week, and I have.  I've done kickboxing when I could, to get extra calories to eat (if I had a party to go to or something), but I haven't officially stuck to a regimen, just exercised when I could.  Now, however, as the holidays are coming and I have midterms coming up soon, I've increased my calorie intake a bit from losing 2 pounds a week to losing 1 pound, until I hit my goal of 160-165 pounds, after which I'll maintain for a bit, and then start to get more fit, by lifting and running. I am starting c25k soon, when I get the time though.

Since losing weight, I've noticed a lot of things.  First - People treat you much better (at least in high school, where everyone's shallow). Not that I was treated badly or made fun of before (I wasn't), it's just that I get more attention and more people I don't know act nicer to me when I first meet them, which also might just be me being less shy and more outgoing as I've lost weight.  Second - Girls give me more attention. Third - I feel so much better about how I look, and feel more healthy overall.  I don't have a recent mile time, but the last one I ran was 11:30 for the whole mile (after which I even got some cheers, haha, after getting so much better at running).  I can do push-ups properly, planks properly, but I still can't do a curl-up yet :(.   Overall, I just feel so much better about myself, and am glad I finally decided to lose weight, and will continues to go until I get to my goal weight.

Oh, and thank you lose it, for all the help.  Without you guys, I wouldn't have been able to get where I am.  Seeing you guys succeed has inspired me to succeed, and you guys have been where I was able to ask questions, and get help.  For that, I thank you guys."

3xjcf9,1,2015-12-19,I Want a RP perspective on what I should be doing with my life,UndecidedThrownaway,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3xjcf9/i_want_a_rp_perspective_on_what_i_should_be_doing/,"TL;DR- I have a low GPA from being a cuck, I currently am expecting to get into a school, but my worry is that despite not having many other options, if I go to this school I'll miss out on the College Experience (TM), should I put aside my doubts and see this time as a prolonged ""monk mode""

I spent my childhood up until high school being called ugly, girls never talked to me, low self-esteem and some other things lead to another... Finally a girl noticed me, my best friend's ex, they had started going out before we hit it off, she dumps him, picks me up as her beta and she got everything she was hoping for and more. I actually was reading TRP at the time all this happened, but I didn't follow anything it said, which is why I'm making this rant, its so sad that the truth was right in front of me but I was too beta to FUCKING LISTEN...

Anyways I gave up my studies, my grades, ETC, friends (this one hurts the most), and I regret it all, I tell everyone I can now to NEVER put pussy on a pedestal :(

/rant

I basically ruined my H.S. GPA when I dated. I have my head on straight now and all Im trying to do is get into school being carried solely by my internships, drive, and my standardized testing.

I was waitlisted from a school this week, which was surprisingly good news; I have known the admissions ""officer"" for some time and she told me that she likes me and just wanted to make sure I'm doing well in my classes senior year... I completely understand that!

But this school is the problem, Its a STEM focused school with a 1-7 girl to boy ratio, its social life is NONEXISTENT. I'm worried that although I'll be well off, I'll be missing out on the College Experience (TM) entirely. Is treating this college as a prolonged ""Monk Mode"" a good idea? I feel like if I do well I'll have guaranteed work lined up, I absolutely love programming, I'll make connections with other smart guys, and honestly I really don't have too many other options lined up besides military service..."

It's all I've wanted to do ever since. I'd like to share my passion for FPGAs with this subreddit by purchasing FPGA development boards for 20 of you.

Here's how it will work:

Send me a PM using a reddit account that is at least 3 months old. Tell me a little bit about your experience with FPGAs and what you'd do with an FPGA board if you had one. Also tell me which of the following boards you'd like:

1. Digilent Arty (Xilinx Artix 7)
2. Terasic DE0-Nano Soc (Altera Cyclone V)

If you are picked I will PM you back tomorrow (Sunday) asking for a name and mailing address. I will only ship to addresses in the continental US. 

My intent is to help people that have the passion and time to learn but don't have the funds to purchase an FPGA board for themselves. My targets are college students, unemployed college graduates and unemployed professionals. If you are an *employed* professional please don't ask for a board. If you already have an FPGA board of *any* kind please don't ask for one. Please don't get all your friends to request a board. Please don't cross post.

**EDIT:** 

Thanks to lord_dong for getting into the spirit and offering to send a board to someone on the far side of the pond.

This giveaway is now closed. If anyone is expecting a board and doesn't receive it by the end of next week please PM me. "

I'm currently a second year computer science student, and am thinking about a career in health. The only pre-reqs that I've completed so far are calculus and inorganic chemistry, and I'm planning to take a Bio and a Physics class next semester, and filling the rest of the pre-reqs over my next two years. Essentially, I'd be keeping my CS major while taking the pre-req courses; will this put me at a disadvantage?

Also, I was wondering what the general opinion was on software related ECs versus biology-related ones? I know clinical volunteering is necessary, but I was more wondering for research and summer programs, for example would a research program look better than a software internship.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, and if anyone has been in this position before, I'd love to hear how you went about doing it!"

3xkfac,5,2015-12-20,First time spending time away from my (19/f) boyfriend (22/m). Scared at how little I miss him?,kbthrowaway9,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xkfac/first_time_spending_time_away_from_my_19f/,"Hey guys, I am a sophomore in college and my boyfriend works full-time. We met last February through tinder and although initially neither of us wanted anything serious, we found out we were weirdly compatible and started dating. 

Just for context, before I met him freshman year, I had no boyfriends or relationships before him. I was a virgin in every sense because I spent all of high school studying and trying to get good grades. Total nerd. He's my first real, adult relationship, and I'm still learning a lot from it.

We told each other I love you, and at the time I thought I meant it. I still do, at least I think I do. What's not to like? He's handsome, funny, caring, honest, and he gets my weird jokes and sense of humor. We've had arguments but who doesn't? We are both straightforward and no-bullshit people so we resolve our issues rather quickly and move on. I had many emotional (and intimate) firsts with him and I have no regrets. We would hang out every week for 2-3 days and then I'd drive back for school and he'd go to work that week. The longest time apart was 10-12 days. 

I am finally home after finals and... something changed. This is the first time I'm home in a year - I spent my summer doing an internship and still got to see my boyfriend regularly. Basically, this entire year I was so busy with school and internships and extracurriculars. But now I'm finally home with my family and I have had a lot of time to think and relax and self-reflect. 

It's been only five days since I saw him and I feel nothing. We talk/call every day and I ask him how he's doing, he asks me the same, blah blah blah. Nothing has changed. But I have never felt so empty and apathetic towards him before. Five days ago, as he drove me to the airport, I was crying and hugging him because of how much I thought I'd miss him, but here I am (he is American, I am not. I am in my home country), and I feel nothing. I don't hate him, I may even feel positively inclined towards him right now, but I don't know if I love him. This is so drastically different from even a week ago, where I was making him scrapbooks and writing him love letters and baking him things and moping about how I wouldn't see him for like a month. 

My family is great, I love being back home, I love my friends... I don't know what's wrong. Maybe I'm just tired from my exams (they were pretty rough)? 

All I know is, I was in a pretty bad place last year around this time. I have not gotten diagnosed (mental disorders are not taken seriously here...), so I can't speak with complete certainty, but I believe I have been struggling with anxiety and depression since my mid-teens. I kind of attempt to ""forget"" it because I went to/currently go to competitive and rigorous high schools/colleges, as well as overloading on side jobs/social events/extracurriculars, but every time I'm alone and have free time, these thoughts come back. They're just so draining. I thought having someone in my life who loves me and cares for me and who I (allegedly) love back would alleviate some of this, but I guess not. 

I don't even know if this is the cause of my apathy and how neutral I feel. When I talk to him now, it's like catching up with an old classmate. Almost like a chore (I'm an introvert so talking is kind of draining for me).

Please help, I don't know what's wrong with me. I know I should be mad at myself for even writing this but I'm not. But I guess a part of me does feel *some* concern? 

Thanks.

**tl;dr: I thought i'd miss my boyfriend of almost 1 year who I love(d?) sooo much because I wouldn't see him for about a month. But now that I am home and alone with my thoughts, I feel very apathetic towards him and don't really... care? It's neither positive or negative. Nothing has changed about our relationship. Wondering if it's because I use schoolwork/side-jobs/relationships to occupy me during the school year/summer time and I only start feeling this way when I have free time as I believe I have had severe depression since my mid-teens. Is it normal to feel this way for someone you love?**"

Age: 17 (Birthday: March 17)

Godrent: Discordia

Appearance: She's got a naturally red spiky long hair, always back in a pony tail out the back of her hat, to show off her three cartilage piercings on her left ear, and her normal ear piercing on both ears. She has bright blue grey eyes, and thick, navy blue glasses, which help her eyes out quite a bit. Her finger nails are always short from her nail biting and guitar playing. She has a brilliant, yet mischievous smile, which isn't very apparent at all times, since she often has a neutral expression. She always wears black Chuck Taylor high tops, jeans, and flannel shirts. She wears a Sleeping bear Dunes snap back all of the time. She's 5'3"", and thin, pretty much straight up and down.

Personality: She's extremely loyal to her close friends, and stubborn. She doesn't want to be like her mom, always causing anger and trouble, although it happens a lot. She has strong trust issues, because, before she found out about her mom, her powers got her in trouble, making people mad at her constantly. She can be pretty morbid, if she wants to be, and brutally honest, but only with her close friends (Meaning her dad, since every kid at school hated her). She can get mad easily, and will hurt whoever makes her that way, no matter how hard she tries. Death has never bother her, probably because it often involves anger in families, which the side of her that is like her mom enjoys.

Catchphrases: ""Don't expect me to be like her. My mom didn't raise me."" And, ""So what?""

Powers

• Can cause anger/bitterness in others (Mostly directed toward her)

• Able to initiate discord and cause chaos

Skills

• Good at playing guitar, and piano.

• She can punch really well

Possessions

• Vintage game boy (Her dad also somehow wired a bunch of newer DS games to work with it.)

• She has those spikes that you put on your fist, so that your punches hurt like crazy

• A backpack of clothes

Backstory:

She grew up in northern Michigan. She was born on St. Patrick's day, showing up on her dad's door step a week later in a run of the mill baby carrier. Her dad was in his last year of school, and his mother, Barbra, who was furious, stopped helping him pay from it. She was a very old fashioned lady, and her son having a daughter without being married angered her. Barbra didn't talk to him or visit for three years. When she finally came back, she started to take care of Lil, watching her while Lil's dad was working at the morgue. Lil was ten when her grandmother moved away, and she started hanging out at the morgue when she was twelve, spending her time in a janitor closet. Her closest friends were the bodies that she would talk to sometimes, after family lawyers would come in and have screaming matches with each other, over wills. She would just say that she was sorry, that it was her fault that they were angry. She could just sense that kind of thing. When she was fifteen, her dad gave her an internship, and she started working with the bodies. Three days before she got to camp, she received a letter from her mother:

*Lilly, how are you? I wanted to tell you a few things. This is your mother, Discordia, roman goddess of chaos. First, you're a demigod. Yep, half greek god, half human. Have fun with that, monsters will probably show up at some point and kill you. Second, you know how everyone hates you? That's simply because of your powers. They aren't hard to control, just think of putting a stopper in them. And, lastly, go to Camp Halfblood, on Long Island, why don't ya? You may have a chance at living until you're eighteen there! Kisses, Mom.*

A monster did attack. She ended up punching the thing out and running, to protect her dad. She found a satyr, after taking a flight to Long Island. She got help to the camp from her.

Lil stares down the hill at the camp, one hand holding the backpack she has slung over one shoulder, the other adjusting her hat."
3xn8ez,95,2015-12-20,Terrifying Night on the Appalachian Trail,spankygrrl,Thetruthishere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/3xn8ez/terrifying_night_on_the_appalachian_trail/,"I lived in VA for a few years with my then-girlfriend, Jen. We're both outdoorsy people, so we often explored the area and tried out new places to hike, canoe, etc. 

Jen was a little obsessed with the idea of some day hiking the AT because she had a couple of friends who raved about it. However, since she was tied down to a rigorous internship, she then got the idea to do an overnight instead, since we lived in close proximity to the trail. When our schedules magically aligned for a few days, she got the idea to do the AT overnight and she couldn't be talked out of it. 

Since we decided to do this on a whim, we were admittedly pretty disorganized in our preparations. It took us a while to get ready and I was starting to feel rushed because it was late afternoon by the time we got in the car with our bags and the dogs. We still had to drive a ways to get to the closest trailhead and I worried about it getting dark before we found a spot and got set up. Not an auspicious beginning.

We arrived at the trailhead right before sunset. It was a large gravel parking lot across a small highway from some businesses. To our dismay, there was a guy in a red car right next to ours, the engine running, but he was just sitting there doing nothing. Jen was a little creeped out, so we tried to take our time in hopes the guy would be on his way. He just sat there doing nothing, not looking at a map, his phone, or us (that I could tell), his car running. We couldn't waste much more time, given that the sun was about to go down, so we shrugged off the creepiness and hit the trail.

It was stupid and ridiculous to start out at the time we did, of course. There are many things about this trip that I would do differently, trust me! We hiked for a bit, passed a trail shelter with 3-4 young guys and girls who seemed very normal and nice, said hi, and a ways down the trail, out of sight of the shelter, we noted a potable water spigot. We got maybe a mile in before I put my foot down and said we needed to make camp. It was near dark and had become difficult to see where the trail led, so we turned back to the campsite we'd just passed.

We could hear the highway traffic in the distance, so the spot wasn't all that peaceful, but we felt good about being near fresh water and also that we were within screaming distance of the other group. We scrambled to make camp. We got the tent up and went on a mad search for firewood in the dark. 

Oddly, all the wood was wet, like it had rained, but we lived in the vicinity and it hadn't rained recently. I'm excellent at quickly starting fires, but we struggled for a good hour, trying to get a fire started because all of the nearby wood and kindling was wet. Our flashlights started to die during the hunt for dry-enough wood, and of course we hadn't thought to bring extra batteries.

With only a failing headlamp left and having burned all the TP for lack of other firestarter, we managed to get a fire going and breathed a sigh of relief. We got dinner going, cracked open the Nalgene of wine, and settled in to chill. We ate, cleaned up, and headed into the tent.

We fooled around a bit and then headed to sleep. Some time later, I woke up not to a noise or anything, but to Jen lying awake and very tense next to me. Sensing her alarm, I asked what was going on, but she told me in a freaked-out voice to listen.

So, I listened. And I heard two things which I still do not have an answer for, but which set me on high alert. It was exactly that feeling that people describe of sudden internal alarm bells going off and knowing that something is really wrong.

First, there was a sound that resembled rocks being dropped from the top of a tree, hitting a bunch of branches on the way down. Thunk. Thunk, thunk. Thunk. Thunk.  It happened repeatedly. We whispered urgently to each other, trying to rationalize. Maybe it's acorns, I said, praying it was just acorns.

The other sound was more alarming; there'd be a period of silence and then somewhere just beyond the perimeter of our campsite, we'd hear a thick branch go SNAP! No rustling, no footsteps, no little twigs snapping... and whatever it was had to be big because those had to be quarter-diameter branches, by the sound of them.

I kept trying to rationalize that it was a wild animal, but I've camped a lot and spent a good amount of time outdoors, and the lack of rustling or other noises really freaked me out. The snapped branches weren't all coming from the same area, either; we were lying there in our tent feeling like sitting ducks, straining to tell if someone was coming, hearing rocks being dropped through the trees in the silence and then periodically a SNAP! from a random direction.

The hardest part to get across was the feeling of being there during this. It felt like *The Blair Witch Project*, terrifying and weird. The strangest thing to me was that the two dogs we had with us were completely silent the entire time. I was so scared at one point that I peeked out of the tent to make sure they were still there and that nothing had happened to them.

We then started discussing our total lack of weaponry, how stupid that was, and what we were going to do. We agreed that it was far scarier to sit in our tent blind and that neither of us were going to be able to sleep now anyway. We cautiously unzipped the tent, checked to make sure no one was around, and came out to sit.

We sat outside, shared the remaining bottle of wine to calm our nerves, and waited for the sun to come up. The noises stopped. Once the sky started to lighten and hours had passed, things felt normal again and it felt safe to go back to bed.

We slept for a few hours and the first thing I did when I got up was to look for acorns. I was really trying to rationalize what had happened and I felt certain that I'd find oak trees around. Well, you know what? I searched all around our campsite and there were no oak trees. We'd camped under a bunch of tall evergreens, but I didn't find pine cones or anything else that could be a likely explanation for what we heard. The snapping branches, I'd say animal, but why wasn't there *any* rustling? And if there was an animal around, why didn't either dog react at all?

We didn't bother with fixing with food because Jen just really wanted to get out of there. We broke down, gathered our gear and trash, and hightailed it out of there. It was such an intensely frightening, weird, and intense experience, that it was all we talked about on the way home.

Jen mentioned hearing about some AT murders, so the first thing I did when we got home was to get on the computer and start Googling. I discovered that in 1986, a lesbian couple had been found murdered while camping on the AT in VA. I then found that *another* lesbian couple had been murdered on the AT in VA 1996. The year we went camping on the AT in VA and had all this weird shit happen? 2006. Yes, really.

We just looked at each other wide-eyed. Crazy coincidence, probably, but that was the final piece for us regardless. Jen said, ""I am *never* going camping on the Appalachian Trail again. Fuck that."" 

-----------------------------

UPDATE: I've spent about two hours trying to figure out where this was and I still don't know. Nothing matches what I remember. It's been almost 10 years, so maybe the trail shelter is gone. Jen took a while to get back to me and she said she doesn't recall exactly where it was, either. :\

She said she thinks it was actually WV, but I looked along the easy access points to the AT from Morgantown and I couldn't pinpoint it. We moved from Morgantown to Roanoke for her internship and were back-and-forth for a bit until she sold her house. I might have gotten mixed up because of it; I do recall coming back to her house after the trip (I was looking up AT murders in her kitchen).

.

**Jen:** ""I'm not sure -- I really can't remember. It was probably the easiest place to hit an access point from Morgantown. And very close to a big highway because I remember we had to walk over it. But I don't remember what the name of the town was. When I get a chance, I'll look at the map.""

**Me:** ""I thought we were in Roanoke? I could've sworn we drove the Blue Ridge Parkway to get there, I know it was a big highway.""

**Jen:** ""Nope -- we lived in WV then, remember? We went back to my house... we were so glad to be back there. I remember sitting in my kitchen being like, ""Holy shit!! What the hell just happened?""

**Me:** ""Ohhhhh.. that's right. I looked up the murders at your house.""

**Jen:** ""When I tell people that story, it's mostly about how I froze, started shaking, cuddled into you, and told you it was pretty much all on you to think for both of us!"""

I’ll be finishing my last semester of college in January and will be having an internship during that time.  The internship is located about 10-15 minutes from my university and apartment; not too far but far enough where I can’t walk to.  

Came home for winter break (9 hour drive, but flew home which which was only 1.5 hours) to stay with my mom for 4 weeks.


Told my mom about the internship and that I’ll need to bring up my car.  Her answer was no, saying that I need to figure out another way to get to my internship.  I explained her that transportation at my college’s city is a poor system and would be unreliable.  She suggested Uber, but I explained that by the end of the semester I will have paid over $1,000 just for using Uber.  She said that it was fine, that she would paying for it and that it would less of a hassle.  Plus, she thinks my car is unsafe to drive the 9 hour trip (Volvo mid size sedan 2001).  


Not sure how it is less of a hassle considering I would always be having to relying on someone else, and economically it does not make any sense to be paying x2-3 more than just parking and gas (dad pays for my insurance).  


Wanted to talk to her about it again this weekend but I’m sure me just having a flat tire a couple of days ago (not a default tire, just a nail) won’t help my case.  


In general its always difficult for me to make decisions and her to be fine with.  She is a helicopter mom (calls 3 or more times a day.  likes me to call her when I wake up, when I’m home for the night, and when I’m going to bed) and likes having me under thumb knowing everything I’m doing and approving.  Slowly been telling her less or lying about where I am or what I’m doing. Treats me constantly like I’m 14 even though I have above a 3.5 GPA, have multiple job offerings for post-graduation, and been given a lot of responsibilities by my jobs and college (probably should to write another post about this since its a growing problem between my mom and I…).  


I understand she is my mom and that she does have some say in what happens in my life; but I do need the car and am not okay with Ubering to my internship everyday.  


Note: My mom does not pay for any of my tuition or housing.  Only pays for flights and clothes.  Can't have dad reason with her because they are divorced and not on speaking terms.


**tl;dr**: Overprotective &amp; controlling mom won’t let me bring my car to college due to my car being “unsafe” and would be a “hassle.”  Having a difficult time reasoning with her.  "

Long story short, his older brother has been cheating on his fiancee for the past few years. The most recent was November. He told her a few weeks ago and now everyone is angry at him, and his ex fiancee is trying to figure out what to do. Naturally, they needed space from each other so his ex stayed at our place for a few days which was totally fine. My SO had already left for break so it was just me and her. Of course she talked a lot about the break up etc. and I was there for her emotionally. I tried to take her mind off of things but that didn't really help. I never liked my SO's older brother (slightly racist/mysoginistic tendencies, isn't nice to my SO) so we never got along. When I heard about the infidelity, I wasn't surprised.
Anyways, after few days, It's my turn to leave for break and my SO and I agree to let her have the key to our place so she can stay a few days. She had planned to go back to her place within the next week or find another living situation. One of her coworkers offered but she seemed hesitant. My SO and I will both be gone for about two weeks (back December 29th and 30th) so she has that length of time to figure things out before we both get back to the apartment and it becomes crowded. (small one bedroom)
This morning, she sends me a text saying going back to her place hasn't worked out and that she's moved a large amount of her things into our place. This made me feel annoyed because she sort of moved in for the long term without asking. We never discussed her paying rent or anything since she wasn't going to be staying for long and it seemed inappropriate at the time. I feel like a jerk for not completely opening our apartment to her without any restrictions, but I'm concerned that with another hard semester of college+work+my internship coming up after break, that her and her ex boyfriend's issue will be distracting. Plus, she didn't tell her ex where she's going but I'm betting he will figure it out and might show up at our place causing a scene. She's from out of state, it's pretty obvious where she would go first. I was completely fine with her staying at our place over the break, but when the new term starts, I'm concerned it's going to cause problems."

The internship I landed is for a regional firm with about 150 employees and about 20 partners. They're offering me to intern with them every semester until I graduate and upon graduation, they'll offer me a full time position. (Year and half til I'm finished)

My goal has to always work for one of the big 4. Should I try to obtain another internship during recruiting season or should I ride out this internship and apply for big 4 after? "

Its times like this when I am hating my hometown the most and remembering all the reasons I left in the first place and really just makes me want to just say fuck it and sign back up. I think if I thought I could get back in and stationed in Germany or Italy I would but other than that really I just want to travel and I don't even know where to start looking for a job that would let me travel across the globe like I want. I also realize I should finish college but I do a decent resume despite that lack of a degree. We all remember that feeling of adventure, not knowing what was around the next corner when we first signed up and I miss that feeling. I just feel lost my fellow vettitors.

3xos7g,4,2015-12-21,"How can I [26/F] separate myself from my SO's [26/M] crazy, catty family over the holidays without being overly rude?",Fam-conundrum,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3xos7g/how_can_i_26f_separate_myself_from_my_sos_26m/,"Hey r/relationships- hopefully you guys can help because I'm at a total loss! 

Just a bit of backstory: my boyfriend of 2.5 years and I live about half an hour away from his parents so I can attend grad school in the major city nearby. My family lives about 6 hours away, and I rarely get to see them, as I'm usually busy with schoolwork and internships. Everyone in my family also maintains a pretty crazy schedule, so frequent visits aren't an option. Despite this, we remain super close and talk almost everyday. Anywho- here is the issue at hand:

My SO's mother and I used to be pretty close, until I found out she was gossiping endlessly about my SO &amp; I on social media. Both he and I have gently suggested to her that it has to stop but she has continued to the point where it's out of control. My SO has given up and simply shrugs it off when it's mentioned, but it really bothers me a lot. This, coupled with the fact that she can't respect my wishes and keep my name off of her Facebook, has forced me to distance myself from her somewhat. I love her, but I can't tolerate the constant gossiping and prying. 


She recently invited me to stay with their family over the holidays, an invitation which I politely but firmly declined, indicating my preference to seize the rare opportunity to visit with my own family. My SO was aware of these plans and while he isn't jazzed about spending the holidays apart, he understands my desires and supports the decision. His mother explained to me that she understood, but has apparently been posting nasty Facebook statuses referring to me as a ""selfish Christmas Grinch,"" amongst other sentiments. She also accused me of avoiding ""family time"" during the holidays because I want to separate my SO from his family. She pointed out that I don't get along well with my SO's brother and his wife (which is true, but is at this point a non-issue) and said that I was being ""controlling."" I have NO desire to keep my SO away from his family over the holidays... We are both adults and can do what we want! 


All of this information comes to me second hand, via my SO's cousin, with whom I am close. I didn't believe it initially, but when my SO confronted his mother about it, she admitted that she had posted ""some stuff of Facebook."" She also revealed that my SO's sister-in-law, with whom I don't get along, also posted some unflattering statuses and had expressed happiness that I wouldn't be present at their holiday celebration. 


My SO's mother has said that if I ""blow them off"" this year, they may be less inclined to invite me to future family events. While it doesn't seem like a major loss RIGHT NOW, my feelings are kind of hurt and both my SO and I recognize that this is absolutely ridiculous. I intended to send her a brief message immediately after all of this went down, reiterating that my preferences had little to do with her and more to do with a desire to see my own family, but I was seriously angry and didn't want to come off as confrontational. I just don't want to be involved in any drama. But now it's been a week and I worry I've waited too long to smooth things over. Any advice? Thanks in advance!  


TL;DR- my SO's mom is pissed that I won't be spending the holidays with them, and has taken to social media to discuss her anger. I've waited a week to say something to her now, and I'm worried it may be too late!

3xosco,2,2015-12-21,Exchange vs IT Honours?,madlols,usyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/usyd/comments/3xosco/exchange_vs_it_honours/,"Just finished 3rd year of B.IT/Commerce graduating end of 2017 and in a bit of a crisis trying to consider my options for 5th year. My thoughts on each:

* Honours (in machine learning related area): would help quite a lot in grad job search prospects and it would be a good experience and challenge to be able to work independently on a project for a whole year. This lets me expand on the courses I've done and work with some fairly prominent professors in this area.

* Exchange: would be a blast, enjoy the last year of uni, need I say more? However, it will mean that I will be overseas during the dates that grad job interviews/ applications are being held. And possibly even disrupt internships as those generally go for 3 months till end of February. (I think) considering most exchange semesters start at different times. 

What are your thoughts on this? job prospects or fun?

I can't wait to see some new exotics, some hope for a competitive scene, more pve content, less straight up recycled content, (OMG MY OLD EXOTICS, THE ONES IVE ALREADY GRINDED HOURS TO GET ARE BACK, I JUST NEED TO GRIND LEGENDARY MARKS TO REPURCHASE THEM, PRAISE BE TO BUNGIE) and all the other great ideas we've seen glimpses of.

They trained us so well to want to come back to the game day after day with these addictive economies, only to dumb down rewards or literally have none worth striving for anymore. It's very much a slap in the face and I expected more from the people who gave us the Halo series.

But I guess it's just, ""well you bought the $120+ worth of DLC's and spent your money on emotes, here's iron banner again.""

3xpvgb,16,2015-12-21,I work at a women's shelter and I'm scared to go back..,KittyLord0824,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/3xpvgb/i_work_at_a_womens_shelter_and_im_scared_to_go/,"**TL;DR** In a women's shelter, light that shouldn't be able to be switched on kept switching on and off. Second floor residential area, overwhelming fear, sense of someone being right behind me, didn't want to turn any corners or open any doors. CYC student reported creepy happenings that day. Second time in residential area that day, same overwhelming feelings of fear and being followed, hallway lights switched off, only switch for the hallway is in a locked room that I was a few meters away from. I'm scared to go back. What's going on? What do I do?

Well, I say ""work"". What I mean is an internship aka student placement. It's a relatively small shelter (max capacity of 25) with two floors. Every two hours we do a house check, making sure no lights have burnt out, no messes have been made, no fire lights are flashing, no phones have been unplugged, nobody has gotten into a locked room, etc. As I expected going into this placement, I've felt spirits before in there. These women and children have experienced abuse so I always figured if a family member or friend had passed, they'd probably be following them around just making sure they're okay. Little things will happen every once in a while. Things will be moved in women's rooms, you can hear a gentle whisper going ""hi"" or something sweet like that (I've even heard ""you're doing fine"" when I was in the bathroom trying to calm down after I'd been told I might be fired). 


**However**, the last day that I was there before winter break, I was seriously sketched out. We had a woman staying with us for a while that very strongly believed if a light flickered, it was one of her children that had passed letting her know they were watching over her. It seemed pretty accurate, since every time her abuser tried to contact her or housing got declined or she had an overall rough day, it would happen and when it happened, she was always in the room. The flickering never spooked me, in fact I thought it was sweet, but I think something was trying to copy or imitate that a few days ago. I was in the kitchen toasting my english muffin (no toaster in the staff room), talking to a couple of the women and another student. The student and one of the women were outside of the kitchen, leaning against the little counter/cutout thing in the wall where we leave snacks for when the kitchen is closed. The other woman was in the far corner making coffee. A while ago I'd taped down a light switch because the lights controlled by it are under the cabinets, right over the bread basket, and it makes the bread go funny. Suddenly, as we're all laughing at something the coffee-making-woman said, that light turns on. I said ""hey guys can we leave that light off please, it makes the bread go bad"" since I'd had my back turned. They all looked at me and shook their head, basically to say ""none of us did it"". The light turned off. We all exchanged glances, the light turned on again. The housekeeper was walking through the dining room, she's been there for a long time and knows the shelter inside and out, so I called out ""Hey Mary (fake name) is there another switch for the under-cabinet light?"" she said ""nope, just the one you taped down"". The light turned off again and I tried to ignore it since I was almost done making my sandwich. As I was packing my things to go to the staff room, the light turned on again. I went over to the light switch and it was flipped up. I tried to flip it down through the tape, it was too tight so I had to take the tape off, flip the switch, and re-tape it. It hadn't done that in the month or two it had been taped down, but I shook it off and went to have my lunch. When I came back, I noticed that a house check hadn't been done in a while so I snatched some keys and started the rounds. As soon as I got out of the stair well into the second floor, I wanted to turn around and run. Just run as far and as fast as I could, but I was already on thin ice with this place so I decided to stick it out. Every time I unlocked a door I was so scared something was going to be in the room/closet. I actually screamed at one point because a window caught MY reflection. I ran around corners to just ""get it over with"" because I was so convinced something was waiting for me around every corner. I felt something behind me the entire time. Even when I was still on the second floor but in the administrative area, I didn't feel a thing. It was just in the one specific section of the upper floor. Later I spoke to one of the CYC students and she said weird stuff had been happening all day like the TV in the locked play room turning on, bottle caps popping up in the middle of the CYC office and spinning ridiculously fast with no bottle to be found, etc. When I went to do my final house check before I left for the night, again in the second floor area, I felt that same imminent danger sensation and as I rounded the corner the lights turned out. The only light I had to go by was from a small window at the end of the hall with the street lights from about 20-30 meters away. I felt my way to another locked room/door in which is the only light switch for the upstairs hallway. Needless to say, in this locked room, the light had been flicked off. I would have heard if another staff member did that since I was literally right around the corner, and none of the residents can get in without us.

I'm so scared to go back. I don't know what to do. Part of me, a disgusting, selfish, part of me, hopes it's following one specific woman and she's gone by the time my break ends.

My 'problem' is not a problem but rather something quite small and silly I would like advice on, but the situation is a bit bizarre and I would love some outside thoughts on the whole thing. 

**TL;DR**: Family has re-established contact with an estranged half-brother that I have never met, I would like to get to know him a little but not sure how to approach without being too cold or too eager. 

**Background**

I am 20 and was raised as an only child. My father was married once before my mother and had two children, a girl and a boy - let's call them Jim and Jane. There is I guess 10-15 years between us in age. 

From what I understand, the ex-wife is a terrible person, caused a lot of drama, Jane took after her mother and did a lot of manipulative stuff like uninviting and reinviting my Dad from her wedding. I do not know the full ins and outs of this drama, by choice, because as far as I have always been concerned, my family is my mother, father and I and this drama had very little to do with me. What I do know is that when I was very little, Jane and Jim both lost contact with my father. My Dad has always been adamant that he will never have Jane back in his life, but as I have discovered now, Jim had very little to do with any spitefulness and was more just easily lead by Jane and his mother. Therefore, my Dad held no animosity towards Jim, but they did not  talk for basically my entire life anyway. 

In terms of how I feel, I have always known that I have a half brother and sister, always assumed they would never be in our lives again, didn't have any real memories of them. It was just kinda a thing. When I was younger it bothered me for a period. Now it does not.

**Current Situation**

Last year, Jane got in touch with me through facebook. Ultimately I decided I did not want contact with her, as she didn't really mean anything to me, and I knew it would bring a lot of pain to my parents. I pretty easily chose the happiness of my existing family over having contact with someone who I didn't know. I still believe this is the right choice. From this instance, however, I did find both my sister and brother on facebook.

A few weeks ago, my Dad's sister said that my cousin had been in touch with both Jim and Jane, and that Jim had requested contact with my Dad again. My Dad said yes on the condition that Jane and the ex-wife not be a part of his life again. Jim explained he had very limited contact with either of them, after having his own family and realising he didn't have to put up with their crap.

So Jim and my Dad have exchanged a few emails, which I saw, mostly general info about their respective families. Had a conversation with my parents obviously, wasn't too bothered by the whole thing as Jim seems to be a decent enough guy. I wasn't too interested in knowing too many details or anything, and figured that since contact has been re-established, I may as well embrace it and start up some communication with him.

**The Dilemma**

During a convo with my parents I said I wanted to message him of my own accord on facebook to get to know this guy I've never spoken to on my own terms. Which exactly what I intend to do, but... I have no goddamn idea what to say.

In my Dad's email to him, he's already filled in general info about me like my age, the college course I'm doing. So what is there left to start a conversation? I want to give enough details that there is enough to start a get-to-know you thing up, but not so much that it's too eager, because I still am a little unsure of the whole situation. But then, I don't want to come off too cold because I can be a bit of sarcastic cow, particularly when I'm nervous or uncomfortable.

So I'm thinking I can say a few things like, yeah I'm studying this course that's a bit unusual, I'm looking to do xyz after graduation, I lived abroad for a while working internships, I have a long-term bf, I like x type of music, y type of movies, no sports whatsoever, that sort of thing. Also that I would like to get to know him/his wife/family a little more.

It still seems kind of childish though. Does anyone have any outside input to give? 

Thanks a lot.

3xr5yk,18,2015-12-21,Launching a new series the right way,Arkelias,selfpublish,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/3xr5yk/launching_a_new_series_the_right_way/,"**TL;DR There is a science to dominating the hot new releases at Amazon, and this is how I'm using it.**

My frst series launched into the Amazon top #4,000 where it stayed for about five months. In the year since then I've published two more novels and a novella, and the series has sold around 25,000 books.

I did well, but I also made a LOT of mistakes. I advertised on sites that didn't give me a return, I mistimed promos, lost out on Kindle Countdown Deals, screwed up keywords, and made just about every other mistake you can make.

Today I have a chance to learn from all those mistakes. I'm launching my second series, and my goal is to get it into the Amazon top 100. I want this series to explode, and I believe that's absolutely possible.

What you're about to read is a detailed strategy describing exactly how I plan to do that. The first section (numbered) is the pre-launch preparation. The second half is the actual launch strategy.



**1- Sharp Presentation**

First and foremost I focused on presentation. If you look at the cover you'll see a pair of bright eyes staring back at you. 

[Link to the book](http://www.amazon.com/Hero-Born-Project-Chris-Fox-ebook/dp/B015P4Q8XS/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)

This was very intentional. The part of our brains called the limbic system is always scanning for threats, and will automatically guide your attention to a pair of eyes if it feels someone staring at you.

This means that people's eyes will be drawn to the cover when scanning down a list of books. Once it lands there they'll see the prominent title, which includes the word Hero (more on that in the writing to market section).

Ideally, they'll click the link and read the blurb. I'd encourage you to take a look. It's short, punchy, and raises a ton of questions in the readers mind. If I've done my work right it will make people interested enough to download the book.



**2- Writing to Market**

Hero Born is absolutely written to market. It IS a story I wanted to tell, but as you'll read below I made changes to fit the genre.

In March of this year I cranked out a novel in just 13 days. That novel clocked in at 55,000 words, and was tentatively entitled Project Solaris. It was a spinoff of my Deathless series that I was billing as X-Files meets Heroes.

I was tempted to publish it right away, but realized that I wouldn't be able to write the sequel for 6-8 months. Having seen what happened when I waited that long to publish I knew that would be a mistake, so I stuck it on a shelf.

Fast forward to July. I learned that both Heroes and X-Files were returning to network television. What's more, I'd seen Todd Hodges Never Hero and Logan Rutherford's The Second Super take off like rockets.

I realized that super hero books were hot, and they were likely to get hotter. So I took a good look at Project Solaris. I realized that the title didn't convey anything to readers. So I changed it. Project Solaris became Hero Born. 

I also changed the plot. Not drastically, mind you. But enough to hit genre conventions. In the first draft the protagonist was a software engineer at a San Francisco startup. He was 28 years old. I dropped his age to 21 and made him an intern.

Super hero books are aimed largely at teens. By changing his age I hope to capture the same sci-fi market as before, but also add in the younger YA demographic. 

As you can see I made compromises, but not large ones. Writing to market means my book will sell many more copies, and I didn't have to change much to do it.



**3- Publishing Quickly**

This next bit has been done to death, but I have to mention it again. I released a book every six months in my first series, which was the kiss of death. By the time each new book came out the previously one had flatlined, and readers had forgotten about the series. If they weren't on my mailing list, then they had no idea the sequel was even available.

This time around I am publishing much more quickly. I will be putting out a book every two months for as long as the series is popular. The preorder for book 2, Hero Rising, is already up on Amazon so that readers can see how quickly it will be available.

This was possible for two reasons. First, I held back a book rather than publishing it right away. Second, I cleared my decks so I could focus solely on the new series for the first few releases.

This should keep me at the top of Amazon's algorithms for the foreseeable future, and will also keep me in the HNRs for the entire time. Everyone from Sara Reine to No Cat have advocated this, and I think they're right. It seems like a sound strategy and I plan to milk it for all it's worth.



**4- Amazon Exclusivity**

Many people know that I have a wonderful relationship with Apple. I love them. They're great about getting me into promos, and are awesome to work with. They've sold a lot of books on my behalf.

That said, Hero Born will be in KU for at least the first term. Why? Because I have no prayer of getting traction if I'm not in KU. We all know how big of a hit you take to rank when you go wide, and I want to maximize my chances of Hero Born taking off.

That said, it will go wide eventually. Probably after 1-2 terms in KU.



**5- Exit Strategy**

So what happens if my stellar plan fails, and this series fizzles? It's very possible that people won't love it, and if they don't how do I react? I terminate the series.

That doesn't mean leaving readers hanging. I have two alternate endings planned for the third book, Hero Dark. If the series takes off with books 1-2, then I'll use the open ended version, and will immediately begin work on book 4.

If, however, the series does meh, or god forbid crashes entirely, then I'll end it gracefully with book 3. Then I'll move from this trilogy into my next project. 



**The Launch Strategy**

Onto the part most people here will care about. What am I doing to launch the book? As people like Wayne have shown us the Amazon algorithms need to see a sustained spike in sales before they'll kick in. My strategy is designed to do exactly that.

**Exposure-** I messaged KDP and requested they add Hero Born to a third category. This puts the book in YA, Science Fiction, and Fantasy. This will give the book maximum exposure. Half of my keywords are designed to broaden subcategories.

The rest are set up for targeted searches for books like mine. After Amazon indexes the book following the initial sales spike it should be visible in a lot of places. This won't automatically make it take off, but it will ensure that the book is shown to a lot of people. 

If they like the blurb and cover as much as I think they will the book should immediately gain traction and start increasing in rank. *crosses fingers*

**Pricing-** Book one retails for $2.99, as my experiments have shown that's the most successful price in the science fiction genre for a first in series. It's high enough to get the $2 royalty, but low enough to impulse buy. 

**Timing-** It isn't accidental that I released the book a week before Christmas. If the tactics below give me the sustained spike I'm after the book will be on fire by the time people are opening up their new eReader and smartphone gadgets on Christmas morning. I want Hero Born to be the first book they see, and my launch should ramp up to that.


**Tactic #1-** I'll be emailing my list to let them know that the book is discounted to 99 cents for the first 24 hours. This makes the buy a no brainer, as it's both cheap and limited time offer. People are far more likely to buy when something is scarce, so this should have the largest number of sales.

My mailing list has gotten fairly large, hopefully large enough to generate a couple hundred sales. I've broken it into two segments. The first group is less engaged, which is why they get emailed first. This will start the sales, but it should be a slow build.

Twelve hours later I'll email the second, more engaged, segment of the list. This is where I'm hoping the bulk of the sales will come from. I'm timing the email to go out at 10pm on a Friday, so that as people wake up over the weekend sales will trickle in.

This will provide a more sustained spike, rather than a quick spike that Amazon will ignore.


**Tactic #2-** The second the mailing list blitz dies the Facebook ads begin. I'm running $15 a day for the first month, broken into $3 ads that I will tweak daily. Underperforming ads will be removed, while the best will receive more of the budget. If one or more does extremely well I can increase the daily spend to $25.

Note that I will lose money on this tactic. I will generate some sales and some KU borrows, but not enough to cover the cost of the ads. That's totally okay, because every sale makes it that much more likely I'll get picked up by the algorithms.

What's more, some of those people who sign up to the mailing list, and over time will purchase more books. I consider this a loss leader to help build momentum.


**Tactic #3-** At the same time I start the Facebook ads I'll be letting people know on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and a host of smaller forums I frequent. I've carefully selected a number of them, and have been an active member of each for a long time so people know who I am. Many are already excited about the book, and I'm hoping this will give another surge in sales.

There you have it. That's the entire launch strategy. I've kept it simple and trackable, so I can study what works and share it here. If I'm right the first book should do very well right out of the gate, but that's really just the beginning.

The series won't hit it's stride until the 2nd book launches, which is where phase two of the launch plan comes in. By this time the 1st book will be out on audio, which will add another layer of both sales and visibility.


**Launching the 2nd Book**

As mentioned above Hero Rising (book 2) is already listed for preorder. I am making an offer to my mailing list that if they review the first book I will allow them to ARC read the 2nd book. The goal is to get to 50 reviews as soon as humanly possible, which I don't think will take long.

The first promo will be a Kindle Countdown Deal, and I will launch it to coincide with the release of Hero Rising in mid February. I'll be dropping the price to 99 cents, and will be listing the book at any and every book advertising site on the web. If I can get a BookBub wonderful, but with or without I will wallpaper the internet with ads.

This should both revive what will likely be flagging sales on book one, and give book 2 a strong launch. These sales will trickle into book 3, which will already be listed for release on April 27th.



**Conclusions**

I'm really excited to see how this launch goes, because it's my first chance to test everything I've learned over the past year. I've watched people like Nick Webb, Wayne Stinnett, Amanda Lee, and many others catapult themselves to tremendous success.

I believe that any of us can do the same. We have all the tools we need at our disposal. All we have to do is learn from people who already have the success we're after.

If I'm right you'll see Hero Born take off, but if not expect to see me come back and talk about that too. No matter what happens I'm going to learn from this, and the least I can do is share the lessons with the friends I've made here =)

If you have either questions or suggestions I'd love to hear them. I am always learning, and you all help me do that!"
3xr9fp,29,2015-12-21,Dividing the Commonwealth,Rickymex,falloutsettlements,https://www.reddit.com/r/falloutsettlements/comments/3xr9fp/dividing_the_commonwealth/,"I've been testing out the idea of making the Commonwealth into various city-states/regions under the control of my Minutemen General Character. I have certain plans for the settlements but it's been a little harder implementing them. Here's how I've divided two of the settlements. Since I'm mostly using this save to get ideas I'm cheating to everything looking good.

**Sanctuary Hills**

* Sanctuary

* Red Rocket Truck Stop

* Abernathy Farm - Sends food to Sanctuary

* Sunshine Tidings Co-op - Sends food to Sanctuary 

Custom Combat Armor Mod - Gold with GDI logo

Basically I'm in the process of turning Sanctuary into a full-fledged city thanks to the Scrap scrap mod. I've plan to have a government office (built already), a city security department, and a technological division in the area where the PC's house used to be. The area around the large tree is going to be turned into a merchant's square with actual stores thanks to the store mats. The two sides of the street at the entrance will be turned into a large hotel and a few fancy looking houses for some of the more rich looking settlers. Very large WIP project. Getting some fps drops here probably due to the scrap scrap mod.

Red Rocket is the place where large shipments are stored until they are ready to be taken. There's a large warehouse in the back for storage with an elevated section with place for 3-4 power armor suits. A 4-man security team with their own building. Brahmin feeding station and 3 locked small apartments for wealthy merchants. Since smaller merchants would go trade in Sanctuary City this place is for merchants bringing in large shipments

Made Blake, Connie, and Lucy Abernathy essential and gave them dresses and suits since my head canon has them become a wealthy plantation family much like the brahmin barons in the NCR. Surrounded the entire farm with security fencing. Expanded the farm in the front and built a long house for workers to sleep at the end of the field. in the back of the house I removed the farm, set up a generator room, and build a pen in the back where I spawned Brahmin. Has one security guard at the entrance, one at the entrance, one on a platform mid fields, and turrets on elevated bridges in the corners.

Sunshine Tidings is basically the same thing as Abernarthy Farm but no leader as I imagine it being under the direct control of Sanctuary City. Security fencing, two guards, and a turret. Also has a bar in the second warehouse and a clinic in the cleanest cabin. Fun seeing everyone go into the bar after work.

**Castlelands**

* The Castle

* Warwick Homestead

* Jamaica Plain

* Murkwater Construction Site

* Spectacle Island

Custom Combat Armor Mod - Grayish Blue (can't remember name) with White Minutemen Logo

This region is very much unfinished so all the following are what it will be, not what it is except for Spectacle Island.

The Castle is the HQ of the Minutemen. Lots of guards in blue Minutemen armor patrolling. A large well stocked clinic in one of the larger rooms, a nice bar in another and the Generals Chambers with a locked door. The armory has both a weapons and armor seller along with T-45's with Minutemen colors. Beds are located in the hallways sections.

Warwick Homestead - Two guards in the front one standing outside the gate the other elevated inside of it. Just a pure farm run by the Warwicks who also become a large plantation family with deep connections with the Minutemen after Billy joins and becomes a top lieutenant. Don't know if I should kill the husband.

Jamaica Plain - Small bar town. Nothing much just the place where off-duty Minutemen travel to enjoy themselves.

Murkwater - Small outpost to serve as the first line of defense from the south and as quick mobile troops from any emergency coming from the Glowing Sea.

Spectacle Island - This is the one's that been giving me much trouble in the planning. I want to turn it into the Minutemen Academy. The idea is that my character build this place after the game in order to increase the size of the Minutemen and to reduce raiders/criminals by taking orphans, sending them to the island until they are 16, then making them interns in whatever division fits them best until they are 18 and full members. This is what I got so far:

* Main Office Building in the north where the boat is.
* Boys and Girl Dorms with teachers sleeping in rooms next to the entrance.
* Combat Class with shooting range in the back and small arena in the middle.
* Medical/Science Class taught by Curie in a Lab coat.
* Mechanical Class with some Atom Cats wannabe. Has crafting items and 2 power armor suits to use as examples.
* Agricultural Class where they learn about growing crops and dealing with brahmin.

If anything is missing please tell me.

Here's the rest of the areas with very simple notes

**The North**

* Outpost Zimonja - Northern Minutement Outpost similar to Mirelurk

* Tenpines Bluff - Farm

* Starlight Drive-In - Major Trading Town

* Covenant - Don't Know

* Taffington Boathouse - Don't Know.

* Greentop Nursery - Farm

**Central Station**

* Oberland Station - Central Minutemen Station. Mostly for emergencies if Diamond City and Vault 81 need help.

* Graygarden - Farm for Oberland

* Hangman’s Alley - Small well-equippedMinutemen Outpost for dealing with Raiders and Supermutants around the area.

* Egret Tours Marina - Another trading town

* Somerville Place - Farm for Egret

**Beachside**

* Nordhagen Beach - Minutemen allied Research Station. Place where the Institute tech was pilfered too. Imagine Virgil joining as a head researcher.

* Bunker Hill - Trading town

* Coastal Cottage - Small village

* County Crossing - Farm feeds Bunker Hill

* Croup Manor - Too ugly. don't know

* Finch Farm - Another plantation house. Feeds Nordhagen.

* Kingsport Lighthouse - Don't know 

* The Slog - 100% Ghould Farm feeds Bunker Hill or Nordhagen haven't decided."
3xrlzc,15,2015-12-21,[No Regrets] I want to contact her everyday but I know I shouldn't,TomatoArmada,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3xrlzc/no_regrets_i_want_to_contact_her_everyday_but_i/,"[No Regrets]

I realize I'm a shitty person.

But that's not why I feel bad.

A few months ago, I met a girl at an internship. I'll call her ""Jo"". Jo was showing me strong signs of interest, so I reciprocated.

To be honest, I was almost certain it would go nowhere.  I'm married.  She is 10 yrs younger, and had a boyfriend of a few yrs.  But I wanted to see how far it would go anyways.

Jo was physically attractive in all the ways I desired. She also had qualities I deeply admired which I found lacking in my spouse. For instance, Jo was driven and goal-oriented.  She had a sophisticated style, and a strong sense of family values.  Jo's stories about her severely dysfunctional family, as well as her differing socioeconomic and cultural background made her fascinating to talk to. 

Right off the bat, we found that we had much in common. We made it known to each other we were not entirely happy in our current relationships, and there were undertones of infidelity. After a month of intimate texting - often into the early morning hours - I aggressively propositioned her to meet me. Although we met alone under the context of friendship, almost everything was designed to feel like a real date. We only went out a handful of times, but they were the most exciting and fun outings I've had in years. We flattered each other with admiration and it felt so genuine.  

For the 8 months this relationship lasted, our interactions would be the highlights of my week. It was nice having something to look forward to all the time. I realize now, that it gave me a sense of validation which provided a real boost in my confidence. The confidence I gained was positively reflected in all other aspects of my life.

But I've dated women like her, and the experience isn't always pleasant. The quality of our interaction typically depended on her mood. The good times felt amazing, while the occasional bad/ugly moments often caught me by surprise. There was something very familiar about it all, that I found comforting and unsettling all at the same time. I even told Jo she reminded me of an ex-girlfriend, but she rejected the comparison. I should have known better.

There were a few times I attempted to be a more apparent and escalate. I indirectly hinted that perhaps there was something more than friendship between us.  Jo rebuffed me with a replies along the lines of ""I don't think of you in that way, if that's what you mean"". But then Jo would continue to flirt and hint there was something more.

Six months into the relationship, and almost everything I suspected of Jo's character came to light. Sometimes she would be open, humble, and very sweet. At other times, she would be arrogant, unreasonable, and dismissive, and even mention other men, besides her boyfriend. I brushed it off and ascribed it to her immaturity.  Perhaps she brought up other men to demonstrate her value?  As the relationship progressed, she would periodically lash out, and this occurred with increasing frequency.

Then it dawned on me one day - Jo had all the characteristics of a narcissist. Having had a few narcissistic women in my life, it made sense why this experience felt so eerily familiar. I recognize that I also have narcissistic tendencies of my own, which I saw in her.

I caught her in a blatant lie, and decided this needed to end. I reasoned that this girl I was so initially infatuated with, never truly existed as I had imagined.

...........................

I'm pretty sure my wife hasn't discovered the full extent of my relationship with Jo, and I never want her to. My wife isn't perfect, but she deserves better. She is mostly supportive and selfless. She often puts my happiness above her own, and I had never been with a woman like that before. That's why I married her.

The problem is I'm just so fucking bored. I feel restless. This tryst with Jo has really highlighted this hole I am trying to fill.

I don't completely understand it. I've made an effort to lead a fulfilling life. I volunteer. I live in a nice area. I have hobbies. I work out. I'm even going back to school because I was unhappy with my career. I go out with my wife and I'm social with her friends and family.

I have my own male friends too, though we are not close. I keep them at a distance because they either don't hold my interest in the same way, or they are assholes.

It's been a month since I've had any real interaction with Jo, and I find myself wanting to contact her everyday. I know it's not because I actually like her, but it's because I crave that validation. I want to feel that excitement and supreme confidence I experienced when we were still speaking and she was enamored with me.

The worst part of it all is that I don't feel as guilty as I ought to about the whole affair. Nothing physical happened between me and Jo, but in retrospect, the experience felt like an exciting roller coaster ride I didn't want to end.  If I were to be completely honest with myself, I would probably consider doing it again.

The rational part of me knows I'm getting to old for this shit. I understand that logically, these pursuits are toxic and fruitless. My need for female validation outside of my marriage is a symptom of a deeper problem. I don't want to be this kind of person.

So I ask of all the redditors patient enough to read through this:

What is it you've done that has made you content and at peace with your life?

............................

TL;DR Was intimately talking to a girl for a few months, and even going on ""friend dates"". I am married. Decided to end it when I discovered she probably has NPD. I feel empty.  How do I not feel empty w/o pursuing female attention?"
3xrtfq,39,2015-12-21,Don't hold onto the past,justleaveDB,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/3xrtfq/dont_hold_onto_the_past/,"I saw this subreddit linked on another thread a while back. Every so often I come here just to read and quietly cheer you all on. I've never commented before because my advice would always be the same: leave. But I figured I could share my story just in case it can help anyone out.

A long time ago, I (22 at the time) started dating a girl (20) who I met at a really fun internship. We hit it off right away and were inseparable. I thought we were a great couple all around. And I especially thought our sex life was great. Our internship ended, and she moved back to her college town. I was still figuring out my next move in life, so I moved there with her.

When we got there, things started to head downhill in the sex department. It started to dwindle, and I got a lot of excuses. She was too tired, too stressed, worried her roommates would hear, worried my neighbors would hear, only liked having sex in the shower (but still turned me down in there too), etc. But I kept trying to make it work. We were a good team otherwise, so we should be able to work through this issue, right?

The DB started to really affect me. I remember thinking we were going to have sex one time, and I start going down on her to get her in the mood, but she picks a fight about something unrelated as I stare up at her from in between her legs. There were tons of situations like that, and I started to get scared to initiate. I couldn't handle more rejection from her. I put my all into the relationship, and it felt so horrible that she seemingly didn't care about making me happy.

Other physical romance began to wane too. We didn't cuddle anymore, she barely ever kissed me, and forget holding hands when walking together. So I doubled my efforts. We tried scheduling intimacy, staying more at my place (I lived alone), going on more romantic dates, massages, and all sorts of other things. Nothing worked. I might get some pity sex once a month, but that was about it.

Finally, after a little over a year of dating, I came over to her place one night. We were watching TV, and I was trying to be affectionate because we had been apart for a week or so. At one point I hinted about having sex, and she gave me an awful look, as if to imply that she could not think of anything more disgusting. So I started the conversation again, trying to figure out how we could fix this. But this time it ended with her suggesting we take a break. I think breaks are stupid, you're either in or out, but I also don't like giving up on things, so I was willing to try anything. At that point I still thought we had a relationship worth fighting for. 

We took a break for a month, set conditions that we couldn't be involved with other people. I tried to concentrate on myself, figuring out how to be better for her. She ended up making out with some guy she had previously said was 'gross' and 'douche-y' about 3 weeks into the break. She was planning on visiting him across the country where he was staying for a couple months. I went over to her place to beg her not to go, saying that our relationship could not be saved if she went. But she did anyway, telling me ""you need to let me do this even if it is a big mistake, and I will face the consequences."" And that was it. We were done. I went no contact and fully concentrated on myself.

It took about a month before I started to feel like I was moving past her. It would have taken longer, but going no contact helped me see how this relationship had really hurt me. 

I realize that our relationship wasn't that long, but that doesn't mean I wasn't really affected by it in the end. The constant rejection left me with a lot of insecurity that I didn't deserve. I was and am a great partner, but I hadn't felt like one in a long time. I had started to even hate some of my favorite TV shows because they would have jokes about sex, and I would feel jealous that these fictional characters were having sex, so I couldn't possibly laugh. My friends told stories of hook-ups, or things they liked, and I sat quietly and smiled while dying on the inside. I would even get grumpy and lash out to people that didn't deserve it, quickly apologizing as I realized that I was angry for other reasons.

But the most important thing I realized is that I had been holding onto what I thought our relationship could be. When we were at our internship, she was funny, sexy, and caring. I assumed we could get back to that if we just tried hard enough. I was wrong; that would never happen again. I started to see the relationship for what it had become, a shell of what it once was. There was absolutely nothing worth saving. I realized that even outside of the bedroom she wasn't that same great partner as when we started dating. She was selfish, demanding, and always on edge. Even the picture of her I had in my head was her with a scowl.

Three months after the breakup she contacted me because she wanted to meet up. She had written me a letter, apologizing for breaking up and saying that she couldn't imagine her life without me in it. It was so easy to turn her down. A small part of me wanted to yell and scream at her, things like ""so you wouldn't have sex with me, but you would fly across the country to fuck some guy you barely like""; ""if I take you back now, will anything even change""; ""I gave you thousands of chances, and you fucked them all up, I don't owe you anything anymore."" But I didn't. I just stayed matter-of-fact and very cordial, telling her I appreciate the letter, but I had moved on. She resorted to other desperate tactics, like sobbing in front of me and telling me that she was the best girl I could ever find. But it didn't matter, I was done a while ago.

Shortly after that I started dating my now wife. We have been together 6 years total, and it has been a dream. Me and her are an incredible team, always looking out for each other. We are physically affectionate all the time outside of the bedroom, and our communication is almost perfect. 

And in the bedroom, we are both very satisfied. Initially she had to help me get over my fear of initiating, because I still had a sense of dread that I would be rejected. But we worked through that easily. Just last night, while cuddling after an intense session, she turned to me and said, ""I know that we don't do anything too crazy in the bedroom, but it's funny because I don't feel like we even need to. I'm obviously willing to try things that you want to, but I feel so satisfied all the time already.""

So this story ended up being really long. But ultimately, I guess I'm saying to let go of the past. Your relationship is what it is now. And the only way it can possibly get back to what it was before is if BOTH partners are willing to work at it. But, let's be honest here, even that often won't work. Your relationship might have been great at the start, but plenty of relationships sour over time. And we hold onto them for tons of different reasons. In my case it was because I didn't want to give up and I actually thought I could get that girl I met on my internship back. But she was gone for good, and maybe never really existed to begin with.

And if you are too afraid to let go for whatever reason, I implore you to think about what you are more afraid of. Is it losing your current 'partner' or never finding the person that will make you truly happy?"
3xs6dd,13,2015-12-21,"I'm going to confront my mom about her abusive boyfriend on Thursday. If she doesn't listen to me, then I will stop talking to her until she breaks up with him.",oakboar,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3xs6dd/im_going_to_confront_my_mom_about_her_abusive/,"June was the last time I saw my mom. 

Sometimes, a weird and frightening feeling swells up in my chest when I say goodbye to someone who I know I won't see for a long time. I wonder briefly as I turn my head to see one last look at them through streaked windows if that's the last look I'll ever have of them. 

The last time I saw my mom was on a warm, muggy June afternoon. She was dropping me off at the airport so I could complete the rest of my internship. I had plans to see her for Thanksgiving. The holiday would mark the end of my internship and my return home for good. We had already started planning the menu and making the guest list and working through the logistics of getting *that many* people into my mom's tiny dining room. 

Life, for the first time in years, seemed to be on the up. Four years ago this month, I was sexually assaulted by my stepdad, my mom's partner for over ten years. It took over eighteen months of fighting with my mom for her to kick my stepdad out of her home and for us to have a normal relationship. My mom started dating again less than a year ago, and I felt happy that my mom was putting herself out there. 

In August, I didn't have any definitive plans for after my internship ended. I had a job offer, but it was going to be a while before it started. I asked my mom if I could live with her. She didn't hesitate to say no. It flew out of her mouth like it was the most ridiculous thing I could have asked. In June, just two months previous, my mom wrapped her arms around me and hugged me tight enough for me to believe she never wanted me to go. My room was pretty much as I had left it when I left for college except for the bed. My mom had purchased a new bed. I slept on a pile of mattresses and bunkie boards, which was fine for me. But last year, my mom had several surgeries and my grandma moved in with her for about three months to nurse her back to health. Since my grandma can't drive, I was at my mom's house a lot to help run errands and take my mom to appointments. 

I digress. In July, my mom's new boyfriend moved in with her. She claimed to be very happy. I was so happy for her. My stepdad had been such an ass. She deserved to be happy. 

The first indication that something was wrong was when she told me I couldn't move back in with her. She told me that she had rented my room out to her new boyfriend, Tom. 

I got angry with my mom when she said told me I couldn't live with her. I don't really remember what I said, but it wasn't nice. The next night I called her, expecting her to apologize to me. She didn't. Instead, she said the following: ""Sweetie, I was going to wait until you got home to say this, but a therapist of mine told me I should be afraid of you.""

According to my mom, she believes that I try to control the aspects of her life that I don't like. She thinks the only reason I ""let"" my stepdad sexually assault me was because I was trying to break up their relationship. I don't think I need to say that I didn't ask to be sexually assaulted. But my mom thinks I did. My mom thinks I tried to have sex with her husband. It makes me sick just thinking about it. It makes me want to scream and punch a wall, reliving the assault over and over again just to prove to myself that I didn't do anything wrong. 

I never made it to my mom's for Thanksgiving. I got a job at the last minute 500 miles away from home right after my internship ended. My sister made it to Thanksgiving, though. She called me three days into her vacation, crying her eyes out, sobbing in deep gulps. She witnessed first hand the emotionally manipulative behaviors Tom was inflicting on my mom. Tom accused my sister of being disrespectful because she didn't immediately drop what she was doing when they asked her to come and watch a TV show with them. My sister was making a bed. It took her less than ten minutes from when she was asked to join them and when she actually did. Tom was so offended that he yelled at my mom, called her a bad mother, and left the house. He was gone for four days. He told my mom that he was sleeping in a Walmart parking lot because he couldn't stand to be in the same house with my disrespectful sister. My sister left early. My mom was more than happy. My sister lives out of state, about 2,000 miles away. My mom and sister see each other about twice a year. Usually, my mom wraps her arms around my sister when she leaves, envelops her with this hug that makes you think that my mom never wants my sister to leave. Instead, my mom smiled as my sister left, not as much as a wave goodbye. 

My mom has stopped talking to my grandma. They used to talk every day. And now, my mom is saying that my brother, who is gay, isn't really gay, that he is merely gender confused. My brother has been out for almost two years now. He has a boyfriend. My mom has met my brother's boyfriend. 

Last week, I made a decision: I paid a private investigator to run a background check on Tom. What came back wasn't surprising. Tom has 18 convictions. Most of them are for physical assault, domestic violence. 

When I am in the area for Christmas later this week, I'm going to sit down with my mom and tell her what I found. I don't know how it's going to go. My mom isn't my mom. I'm scared. I just want my mom back.

When i did a google search on the 20th of December 2015, or 2015-12-15 for Mirte Dufour
I found a youtube channel;
a vimeo channel;
a MySpace page;
a Blogger profile;
and a Google+ page;

The youtube channel was Meren2109 with the name Mirte Dufour.
The about page contained a link the the Google+ profile for Mirte Dufour.
The channel had 3 sunscribers with 2,964.
The Related Channels side bar contained one channel, WhisperCrystal.
It contained 5 videos all from over 3 years ago. 
they were:
""Kamuflasjefylla Vs Kil'jaeden"" posted on April 20, 2009.
""Youtube Test"" posted on August 2, 2009.
""Insane in the Membrane"" posted on August 2, 2009.
""A Final Dream"" posted on January 24, 2012.
""Walk Me Home"" posted on March 24, 2012.
""[ARCHLORD] Invisible Mount"" posted on December 2, 2012.
None of the videos contained any talking, only music.
Some of the videos referenced Mandy Moore.
The video ""A Final Dream"" has a picture of a drawn women on a pink background. At the beginning the word Mirte is flashed on the screen.

The vimeo channel contained 106 videos, the most recent being from 3 months ago. 
My impression is that they will all be videos of music, because the few i saw appeared to be music videos, but not of the same artists.

The MySpace page consisted of a picture of a woman in full body profile leaning against a wall in black and white.The location was listed as Antwerpen, Vlaams Gewest, Belgium. It was connected to 10 other profiles:
Christian Johannesen
Rasmus Nielsen
KayDee
Lalouline Editions
NUDEX [Buy ""Hot Shot"" on iTunes]
GREGO
Em prod
Joni Sheila
Xaman-Ek
SMTO

The Blogger profile was started on March 2009, with 391 profile views. 'My Blogs' had the words ""Warcraft Gold"" witch was linked to the blog goldlimit.blogspot.com

The Google+ profile was the same as the one linked by the youtube channel. It had no posts.
It had 4 followers, and 1,947 views.
The about page said that her Gender was Female
The page said that there were 4 people in her circles, but it only showed three:
Miguel Herrera Ögren
Erika Prezioso
Mirte Dufour
There was a link to the youtube channel Meren2109.

The blog goldlimit.blogspot had the header ""WARCRAFT GOLD"" with only a single post from March 8, 2009.
The date was written in dutch, as well as the footer of the page, and the sidebar, and links. The actual post was in english. It was titled ""What is this Warcraft Formula? Does it Work?""
There were two links to the Blogger Profile.

	What is this Warcraft Formula? Does it Work?

	I heard something about a new product the other day from a few friends of mine that spent a lot of time sorting through all the new guide content out there. They had stumbled across what they said was a monthly eBook membership site – I didn’t believe them at first because I couldn’t see how a website could produce an eBook every month. There just isn’t that much to talk about in World of Warcraft. But, I stopped by the site to check it out and make sure it wasn’t a scam. Too many times, these big promising sites will say more than they can deliver. Here’s what I found out.

	First of all, the pedigree here is pretty solid. The authors of the guides on Warcraft Formula are Brad Johnson (of Warcraft Millionaire fame) and T Dub Sanders (of PvP Bible and WotLK Secrets fame). The two are a great pair, bringing in gold making and PvP – the two most popular sources of information and guides for the game – and they pretty much have all the resources you could need to be effective in the game.

	The premise of the site is pretty simple. You pay an upfront fee to get their Fast Track Action Plan – a guide that shows you how to put a solid account together. The guide is actually a lot more useful than it sounds at first look – it shows you how to pick a character but it also shows you which mods to get, how to join a guide, where to level and farm gold, and how to start in PvP and raiding. It’s a solid walkthrough of all the basics of the game for a beginner or a casual veteran.

	After this, you get the actual product, a monthly newsletter that comes complete with details on PvP in the current month, new changes to the game, questions from readers and just about any kind of info on the game you can imagine from class changes to whatever else might come up. There are a ton of different topics already covered in the first four issues (with PvP covered in every issue).

	In the end, you get a solid starter guide and brand new, time sensitive content each month from two of the best guide writers in WoW for a pretty low monthly price. It’s hard to believe, but this is a great deal and even better than my friends told me about. I’ll be subscribing to my own monthly membership, just to see where Brad and T Dub take it.

When I looked up ""what happened to WhisperCrystal"" on 2015-12-21, one post sticks out.
It is from the huffington post, and is titled ""Carlisle Brigham Dead: 29-Year-Old Woman Found Fatally Injured In The Lower East Side (UPDATE)"" 
It is between ""WhisperCrystal - YouTube"" and ASMR Interviews: Cutebunny992 - ASMRYouReady""
The article doesn't contain the word ""Whisper"", ""Crystal"", or ""Youtube""
It was written on 2012-8-27, and updated on 2012-8-29. This was a Monday.
It says she died ""on Monday"" which either means 2012-8-20, or 2012-8-27.
It says the woman who died, Carlise Brigham, lived in New York, on the Lower East Side.
There are five links in the article.

	A 29-year-old woman was found bleeding heavily from a slash wound to the neck in the Lower East Side on Monday.

	The Daily News reports Carlisle Brigham was found on the first-floor stairwell of an Orchard Street apartment[http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-dies-found-east-side-tenement-apparent-slash-wound-throat-article-1.1145534], where a neighbor said she ""had blood on her face.""

	The woman was taken to Beth Israel Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

	Brigham was reportedly living in the apartment building with a roommate while estranged from her husband Anthony Champalimaud[http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/08/27/woman-found-dead-inside-lower-east-side-apartment/], the son of a prominent Portuguese family.

	The couple were married in 2011. According to their New York Times wedding announcement[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/fashion/weddings/carlisle-brigham-anthony-champalimaud-weddings.html?_r=1], Brigham worked previously as an intern for the American Museum of Natural History in New York. She is the daughter of James Brigham Jr., who worked as the city's budget director.

	Police are questioning Champalimaud, but sources say it appears as Brigham may have fallen off the stairs[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Woman-Found-Slashed-in-the-Neck-on-the-LES-167563265.html]. No weapon or blood trail were found either.

	UPDATE: Brigham's death has been ruled an accident[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/beauty_in_death_fall_OXnjBsAvp5HuRLORGm8ZtM]. A representative for the medical examiner said Brigham fell down the stairs and suffered blunt-impact wounds to her head and neck after falling down the stairs.

	Aside from the obvious this isn't an accident, why did this article pop up when I googled Whispercrystal? I hope that she isn't dead, but this link raises questions as Whispercrystal was also a blonde woman.

	 So when WhisperCrystal stopped uploading it was April 22nd. When that lady Carlisle Brigham died it was August 27th. If WhisperCrystal was Carlisle Brigham, there was a 4 month period of no videos until she passed away, which 4 months of no uploading would be a weird occasion for her. So that means she is probably alive, and she recently deleted her Facebook. She had a husband and supposedly he didn't liked he making these videos and WhisperCrystal was being stalked, and weirdos were trying to find her. So there's a big possibility she's alive, she just decided to stop uploading because of her husband and the weirdos.﻿
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

WhisperCrystals last video post was on April 22, 2012, or 2012-04-22.
The Huffington Post article was on 2012-08-27.
It appears that WhisperCrystal uploaded a video at least every month, but I have not gone through all the videos to confirm this.

On every video WhisperCrystal has a link to a Facebook page.
This is the link http://on.fb.me/fTprqz
This page is currently down, and has been down for an unknown amount of time.
It has been down for at least 4 months according to a comment on the video ""#10 - *Whisper* A Relaxation Journey Through the Senses""

	 @444CURTIS I will be moving to the mid-west :) Apparently it is going to get pretty cold with lots of snowfall :) I guess I like the idea because I never really lived in a very cold country. If it snows, this will be my first proper white Christmas, just like it should be. I am really looking forward to getting my Christmas tree when I come there in about 2 weeks time now :) Canada always sounded appealing because of the beautiful nature and cool weather :) I can't wait to visit over there! :D x﻿

	 @444CURTIS I know what you mean. Even if I find the most amazing place in the world I don't think I can just settle there forever. I just have to travel and see more of this beautiful world. I must say we share the same feeling about visiting hot places. I have lived in places that went over 122 degrees (50 C degree), but I can never get use to that and always preferred cooler places. Having said that I never experienced real freezing cold. So we shall see how it goes this winter in the US :) x﻿

I would love to see Machu Picchu and Lost City of the Incas :) Tikal and Mayan pyramids.. Easter Island would be pretty awesome :) I want to go to Greece and see the Acropolis in Athens and Temple of Olympian Zeus :D Btw, you seem like you live in a beautiful place already.

I would love to see Canada too, I hear all about it's nature, beautiful cities and how it's one of the most pleasant and peaceful places to live in :) I want to see some of your big cities, and really would love to go to Niagara Falls :D I have been to Egypt when I was younger, it was magnificent!!

That really is incredable :) My husband apparently has bloodlines from Scotland from a Knight who was a lord of a town over there. But don't know much more than that... And as for mine, I come from such a mixed background as my family moved a lot over the years, so I don't think I can ever track down my whole family tree. Shame :) x﻿

	 @444CURTIS lol Yes! As I said, there will be more soon.. I just can't see myself not visiting these beautiful places rich with glorious history :) I am very glad you enjoyed it :) I have a mixed background to say the least lol. I have mainly Turkish origins, and some Greek, Italian and Norwegian.. Most of my relatives are still in Turkey, and I lived there too and speak the language fluently.. but I lived in the UK the longest.. Soon will be moving to the US..

	 She appears to be Carlisle Brigham, who died 3 years ago from a fatal accident. I have found articles of the incident that contain pictures of her when she was still alive. Please the note the striking similarity of her YouTube profile pic with pictures of her found in such articles. Also note that she was married to a man with Portuguese heritage who traveled to Europe for work, and she lived in New York (explains shift in/out of developed accent from being married to a foreigner(?) ). She seemed very outgoing with her love for yachting, being with friends and social drinking, and even worked at the American Museum of Natural History in New York (explains her vast video topics, knowledge, creativity, and stunning choice of video images). These are just theories, but a good theories nonetheless. Take a look at the articles below to read in detail. Hopefully, someday, we will all get closure on what happened to WhisperCrystal who shared her healing voice to us all.

	 +kungfumatts Thanks for the info. But are you sure this is WC? There seems to be a difference between her profile pic and the pictures in the articles. The eyes look different somehow. I always thought WC's eyes were blue, but I something still seems different to me...﻿

	kungfumatts 5 months ago
	 I agree with you, WhisperOcean. One cannot say if this is really her due to that fact that we did not even see one single photo of her on YouTube except her profile picture, which appears to be some caricature, in my opinion. But since the profile pic does centre around her eyes, I compared that to the new article photos taking into consideration that she might have worn makeup too. When you add that to her time of disappearance and time of the death in the article, there is a connection. Then I cross-referenced her video themes, personal style, and such to the background info stated in the articles. There's too much to ignore. So, I stand by my findings. I'm glad that my post has caught your attention, because I am a fan of WhisperCrystal. I hope this helped her name and your ASMR community.﻿

	 +kungfumatts I have to respond to end these claims. From the date she first uploaded, she lived in England but has traveled and stayed around the eastern hemisphere for most of her life. United Arab Emirates, India, Egypt, Turkey and more. Her father was not hinted to be a budget director, describing her dad as 'Bruce Willis in Armageddon' who was resourced and relocated to different countries which came about her unique, challenging upbringing. However she did meet an American man, got married and bought a house in the USA whilst working and living in the United Kingdom. There is no evidence to suggest she had citizenship in America but she did travel to and from the United Kingdom when she could. I firmly believe she is a computer programmer and spoken of being married a year before Carlisle Brigham ever made her way down the aisle.

(...in this case my mono-ex &amp; her bf),new_old_bf,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/3xt41e/resources_about_being_the_new_guy_in_a/,"I'm looking for information/advice I suspect already exists, just not sure what to google and the FAQ didn't get this specific that I noticed.

I'm looking for resources for people in my situation at any level of specificity, so I'll state generally and get more specific:

1. Advice / things to think about when (potentially) becoming involved with one partner of an existing couple?
2. As above, but specifically as a new (hetero) male becoming involved with existing hetero couple
3. Either above specific to it being my first polyamorous relationship
4. As above, specific to it being their first poly relationship (not sure that's strictly true, but I could be first beyond some open-dating)
5. Specific to the fact that I was (briefly) involved with the female partner before she started dating the male partner (doesn't seem like gender matters much here, but specificity doesn't hurt)

Anything come to mind?

To address an imagined elephant: I admit this sounds like maybe good potential for drama, but girl and I dated a few years ago and have been pretty good friends the whole time since. We ""split up for a while"" rather than go long distance during a cross-country internship and she and boyfriend got together before I got back. I don't know her bf super well, but we've always gotten along in our limited interactions &amp; I've always been happy they are happy, if admitidely a little envious/sad for having gotten ""dumped"" with the timing of how things played out.

Anyway, they apparently are entertaining some type of non-monogamy to the tune of polyfidelity after discussing it for a longish time, and she reached out to me expressing interest in rekindling our old flame, an interest I share. I believe that I am sincerely interested in exploring this with her, and ALSO sincerely desire to not cause more than inevitable natural strain in their existing relationship. 

There are several other poly relationships in our social circle so while I think people may be a bit skeptical of the particulars of the history here, they shouldn't be too unsupportive I hope.

Anyway, I am cautiously excited about maybe embarking on this relationship with her and them, but I'm an overthinker and a believer in not making every mistake for your self, so I figured asking for advice probably wouldn't hurt?"
3xteqj,13,2015-12-22,All I want for Christmas is for someone to hire my boyfriend full time.,frustratedandbroke,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3xteqj/all_i_want_for_christmas_is_for_someone_to_hire/,"My boyfriend is a wonderful guy - he's kind, caring and I've known him as one of the happiest people in my life for the past six years.

We went to colleges close together, we had awesome groups of friends and in general, we really had a great time. Then graduation happened and it's like our worlds fell apart. Why? Because my boyfriend majored in English and Education.

If anyone is familiar with NYS teaching certification, then you understand the whole process of this stupid EDTPA project. You spend a whole semester putting together a portfolio of all your work and everything you've done for your class, etc. etc. It's a great idea - except when you fail it. And when you're as unlucky as my boyfriend, you fail it by one point.

If you're also familiar with NYS certification, then you know that you have to take quite a handful of other exams. Each costing over $100. Failing the EDTPA (at least this year, future graduates have to redo the whole thing) requires you to take more exams and pay more money. So whatever. This is all fine and dandy unless you're working a minimum wage job, that only allows you twelve days off a year so you can't just go and take all the exams at once (especially because you can't afford to). 

So unfortunately, it seems like no one will hire him or take him seriously because he doesn't have this certification finished. He only has two exams left to take but he can't afford them right now, and we're hoping he can get them over and done with in January (and that he passes them).

In hindsight, I don't think we thought it would be this difficult and convoluted. If we had known he wouldn't even be able to get a sub position or work for a charter school without a certification, then maybe we would have looked into office work or something else to put on his resume. Internships, or secretary positions, receptionists, etc. But nobody will hire him. Why? Because his entire resume is just teaching experience.

We've applied to so many things, I've lost count. So many nights spent coming up with new job titles to search for. Publisher, editor, junior producer, associate editor, ghostwriter, associate secretary, tutor, nanny, babysitter... it's come down to picking at scraps. And it's so heartbreaking. There's no hope left in those cover letters and emails he's sending. We haven't heard back from anything in months and the last was from a charter school that said they were highly interested &amp; willing to work with someone who was working towards certification. Talk about getting your hopes up.

All I want is to see him light up again. I just hate watching him turn off and get depressed when people talk about Christmas bonuses, or the vacations they're about to take... meanwhile he's being compared to his cousins that both have full time jobs, live in their own apartments in Manhattan and we're all the same age. 

Friends &amp; family have tried to help, we've posted on facebook groups, reached out to former professors; this search is really getting desperate. I don't know how much more he can take. He really isn't himself anymore and it's all come down to money.

Because he has to pay for his exams.

Because he pays his parents rent for his basement.

Because he has to pay for the car he has to drive to his minimum wage job since we live in the suburbs with no local transportation.

Because the deferral on his student loans just expired yesterday.

I wish I could at least pay for us to take a nice vacation and break from all this cruelty but I myself am stuck in an accelerated graduate program until May. So the only money I've been able to make is from babysitting and odd side jobs.

Yesterday he told me ""I wish I didn't go for my dreams. I wish I could have just done something corporate and lived a mediocre life"". 

This is so damn frustrating. At this point, it often feels like I might get hired before he does (my career choice isn't exactly as selective). 

I guess we're all just sitting around waiting for our lives to start.

So santa if you're out there, please align whatever stars you need to get my boyfriend a real job. Thanks.

**tldr** My boyfriend majored in English and Education. There is no luck for any sort of job on the horizon until he finishes his certification - which he can't do yet because he can't afford to pay for the exams with his minimum wage job. Stuck in a circle of despair and constantly waiting for our post-grad lives to start.

3xukcz,7,2015-12-22,Questions about Internships (Stage),avivish,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/3xukcz/questions_about_internships_stage/,"Hey guys,

I have been accepted to stage at a  renowned top restaurant (one of the best in the world),and I am awaiting responses from other restaurants that I had applied to earlier.I have always believed that to be the best, you have work under the best.

Considering my  very short experience in the industry coming from my previous internships at hotels (I am currently pursuing a HM degree), I feel that the idea of working/staging at these top restaurants makes me feel it's a bit of big move  for me.Also the fact that I will have to fund my expenses during the time of staging is a matter of concern at the moment.

Do you think I should just wait it out for a couple more years and work in comparitively smaller organisations to gain some skills and confidence and also some bucks before going for the big ones?

Is it too early for me?! 

Thanks a lot! :)"
3xv9wp,2,2015-12-22,I am not ready to leave,Csut94,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3xv9wp/i_am_not_ready_to_leave/,"Hello guys,

I am having a real tough go of things. I am currently home for winter break from college, and I am about to start my 8th semester at school. A lot of my friends are graduating, and I have a 5th year next where I am afraid of being alone and worrying about the real world, especially not seeing my family as much.


I am extremely close to my parents and brother. I have always been a homebody, avoiding the active group of social kids who would go out on weekends and party, while I enjoyed playing video games with my brother and enjoying the security of knowing my parents were only a room away in case I needed anything. I have taken summer jobs in my hometown and lived in my house with parents as most people do during school, but I have avoided opportunities to go on trips or internships where I would have to live and spend time away from my family. Moving on to the real world where I will most likely live away from parents and only see them on brief breaks and extremely short holidays is terrifying. I can't function like that. I love them too much, they mean too much to me. I  get into periods where I become extremely depressed and hurt when I think about them passing away in the future. I cant enjoy the present. I am too fixated on the struggles of the future and how time is always moving on and how they are growing old just as I am. I dread the day when they are to pass away, I don't think I will want to live on this earth when they are not here. Its scary, and I beat myself up constantly thinking about that. 

I have always had only a handful of friends with whom I am extremely close. In high school, I had three or four friends with whom I spent time out of school and felt comfortable with. Of course I had other acquaintances in school, but I never felt a deep relationship with them. 

When I started college, only one of my ""close"" friends came with me to the same school. I lost contact with my other closer friends from high school and haven't seen them in years. I stuck close to my one friend from high school when we started college and I was lucky enough to meet another four of five people with whom I have established deep friendships. My good friend from high school graduated this semester, and he is sticking around this next semester to work on campus and plan his life. This is what has recently triggered my emotional breakdown and severe depression. 

I am feeling like all of the friends are leaving my life and are going on to the real world where they will flourish and I will shrivel. They all have other friends outside of our ""core"" group of five or six friends, and I feel as though this core group is all I have. With them graduating and leaving, I feel as though parts of myself are dying off and I am here left outside in the cold. Knowing that my group of close friends is going to be cut in half this summer, and that it is going to be cut down again following the first semester of the next school year is just so daunting. It has taken me so long to get to this point, and now that they are moving on I feel as though I will never make deep friendships again. 

The quarter life crisis is real. I am scared of the future. I have three more semesters of school before I actually enter the real world, and I am already living as if I am in the middle of it. I can't imagine how devastated emotionally I will be when I actually do graduate. I lack confidence in my ability to live as a functioning adult and managing a life-work balance. 

If anyone has any words of advice or similar experiences, please help me. Letting me know what you went through and how to you dealt with it will help me with my struggles. 

TL;DR - I am scared of all my friends leaving me for the real world when I am left at college for another year. I am haunted by the fact that the time I will be able to spend with my family shortens every day, and that I will have no more long breaks to spend with them.

However, I ended up really thinking about if medical school is for me. The main areas that concern me is long hours especially during internship and working really hard during undergrad for a low low chance of getting in medical school. 

I've since switched my major to psychology and I decided to take some time off to really consider if pre-med is for me after taking only science and math first semester. Is this the right idea or am I shooting myself in the foot?

-I am not taking any science or math classes but I'm going to be a TA and in two research labs.
-I'm going to be co-conducting an experiment with a professor and hopefully going to get coauthored.
-I'm planning on over the summer shadowing a bunch of doctors and other clinical jobs in the psychology field (neuropsychology) to see if I can regain that passion back.

Edit:
I should mention I did not do nearly as well this semester as I should have and Im kicking myself for it. 
I got a B in pre-cal and a C- in Gen Chem 1. On the good grades I got an A in Bio and bio and chem labs I got an A-."

3xx193,5,2015-12-22,I recently turned 20 and I feel further away from my goals than I was at 15,IlParnassoConfuso,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3xx193/i_recently_turned_20_and_i_feel_further_away_from/,"To sum it up, I'm transgender. When I was in high school I'd dream of being an adult, somehow I'd magically transition and move to a different country to start a fresh life. I'd have a good job and a group of tight-knit friends I could rely on.


I turned 20 some weeks ago and so far I have yet to ""check"" anything on that list. I was dreading turning 20 ever since I was 18, and now it finally happened. It just struck me the other day that now each year is a new twenty-something, and before I know it, I'm 30 and a bigger failure than I am now.


I was loosing weight last year but gained it all back and some. My teeth are awful, and when I was almost done with this almost 10 years long treatment I was advised to change dentists and start a new one. After about three years I haven't even started the new treatment because I'm waiting for the dentist's good graces to call me back (my mother called him this month - because I'm such an independent adult I couldn't do it myself- and he told us to wait for him to call us).


After missing out on basically everything a teenager experiences in those years because of depression, being transgender,etc now I'm sure I'm going to miss out on everything about being an adult. I see people on facebook, they are all independent, they do things on their own and with their friends. I never go out on my own, I don't have any friends.


But except for these ""fantasy lives"" I have on my mind I don't really have any plans for the future. I think to myself ""I'll just kill myself in a couple of years now, why even bother?"". Suicide has been on my mind daily for the past 6 years now, and sometimes by the end of a week I feel physically exhausted because I have so many negatives thoughts about myself, and I just bombard myself with them 24/7.


I have social anxiety and now because of my internship I only have ONE SINGLE WEEK for holidays, which is this one. I loved school/college breaks at the end of the year because it felt like my time to recharge, to leave my home the least possible and not have to deal with anything social.


For now getting thinner would be good enough. Sometimes I think in postponing a possible suicide because I wouldn't want people to see my dead body like this. I wish I had the will to become anorexic, but its too hard."

3xx7ys,1,2015-12-22,"To Studio Executives, the MPAA, and everyone who wants to kill movie piracy",leafs81215,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3xx7ys/to_studio_executives_the_mpaa_and_everyone_who/,"Since downloading movies is such a big deal right now, given the situation with 'The Hateful Eight', 'The Revenant', and the numerous other 'screeners' hitting the internet sometimes in full advance of their theatrical release; I want to give you one film fan's opinion of the problem and how to solve it. 

First of all, stop saying that piracy is killing the movie industry. It's impossible to make that argument when Star wars made $600 million in Box Office revenue in 4 days. It makes you sound like complete idiots.  I can't stand when some studio exec or MPAA rep comes out and says that we lost x amount of dollars, and people are losing their jobs because of piracy. The film industry is going to hit a new high in box office receipts this year. Yes, film attendance is likely down, because ticket prices are up and the economics are starting to make very little sense.  

Think about it, I have a family of 4 and i want to go and see a movie. $13.99 a ticket, that's about $55 right there, add another $12 total for 3D you are up to $68. The kids want popcorn, the wife likes M&amp;M's, and we're thirsty. There's another $40. So it's just around $110 to go and see one movie. And your only seeing that movie once. On top of that, i have to sit next to that infamous 'Tommy Texter' in the theatre, or 'Sally Gabbers' and her idiot friend who won't shut up. My kids won't sit still, there's not enough leg room, and I honestly can't stand it when I get there too late and have to sit up close enough to kill my neck.

The alternative is that I can sit at home, download the movie for free, let the kids run around all they want, spend a total of $8 on better quality snacks, have a few beers, lie on the couch and watch the movie over and over in a comfortable pair of pajamas. And i keep the movie on hand, because the kids love it and it's really the  only thing that shuts them up when I'm ready to send them to bed for two days because i have a blasting headache. 

2nd scenario.  i want to take my wife out to see 'The Hateful Eight' on Boxing Day. In fact, I'm a huge film nerd, and my wife and i want to go and see all of the potential Oscar nominees, before the Oscars so we can have an intelligent debate (and actually care) about the winners/losers of the night. I love challenging films, small, indie films, foreign films and highly regarded and critically acclaimed films.  So I have to find enough time to see all of those movies, enough babysitting hours for my kids because these movies aren't for them,  and enough money to go through the same routine I mentioned above multiple times to enjoy the best films that the year 2015 has to offer. 

Let's say I clear all of those hurdles, and I now have the time to go and see all of those wonderful films. Let's check showtimes, release dates, yeah...not a single one of those movies is playing near me.  Star Wars is playing in 18 different screens, in every conceivable format, every half an hour on the hour. But I've already seen Star Wars and, while I thought it was amazing, I'm ready for something different.  Yes, not one of those movies is playing close enough for   me to go and see. 

The alternative is that some nice intern who works for Joe Oscarvoter, was kind enough to steal his bosses copies of all of those movies and upload them to the internet. Because awards mean big business, studios send out out free copies so that people will watch movie X, nominate it for Best Picture, so that the day the Oscar nominations come out the studio can make a brand new TV spot claiming movie X is now the most acclaimed movie of the year! I believe that movie X might be good, but here we are 3 weeks from the Oscars and I haven't seen it. So now, i'm kinda bummed out that there are so many great movies up for all of these awards and i can't watch them unless I go onto the internet and download them illegally, which might make me happy until my Internet provider sends me an email demanding that I cease my copyright infringement right away. 

I felt bad about stealing, and I don't want to do it, but I just want to see those movies so badly, I'd be willing to pay to rent them, or stream them online. But there is no service like that available, because if there was, the big bad theater chains would be so upset that they would refuse to screen movie X in their theaters and that would mean more lost revenue. It's too bad that now I'm considered a thief, and a pirate, because I wanted to watch those great, acclaimed films but they were not available to me legally, so I had no choice. At least now ABC, and NBC, the HFPA and the Academy will be happy because I am an informed and invested awards show viewer.  But I am a criminal in the minds of Studio executives and the Motion Picture Association of America. Thanks to new copyright laws, I could be charged up to $5,000 for each movie I downloaded.  I was totally willing to pay $10-15 to see these movies, or even pay a subscription to a premium streaming service that would make all of these movies available to me. 

i guess, i just won't bother at all.  I'll be 8-10-12 months behind, until the movie shows up on Netflix or iTunes. There's no point in watching any awards shows, because those movies aren't available in my area. And now instead of getting $10-15 from me, or even more should I subscribe to a premium service that allows me to stream these movies, you'll get about 4/10 of a cent of my Netflix subscription. Or potentially $5,000 if you decide to sue me. 

It seems ironic that most of the leaks onto the internet come from  somebody within the film industry. It's even sadder that without movies, movie theaters are big empty houses with alot of seats, like most NHL games in Florida. Yet, the movie theater chains seem to have alot of control over when I can see movie X, without having to put up with Texters, talkers, overpriced shitty popcorn, cramped  seats and poorly projected films.  36% of Canadians who download movies would pay a reasonable fee to watch the same movie, at the same time, legally.  

You know, there used to be another step between the Theater Chains and Cable subscription services, that would get exclusive rights to rent out movies 3-5 months after they were in theaters. They had high prices, overpriced snacks, and even charged you fees for bringing a movie back too late. Whatever happened to them?"

Honestly I wrote this post in the middle of the night, just feeling so down about myself. I thought posting here would be worth it if only one person replied, I mainly just needed to vent about my situation. But I did not expect all this! Thank you all so much, what a wonderful community! I am feeling so much better about my situation and have not felt this way in a while, all thanks to you r/xxfitness :) 

Sorry in advance for the wall of text. I don't know where else to post - I guess loseit might be better but honestly I feel a little more comfortable here. I have no one to turn to and I'm just sitting here crying about what has become of my life. I'm just so tired of looking in the mirror and seeing a person I absolutely despise. 

Just some background - I am currently 22 years old, 5'2"", 155 lbs. When I was 18 I was around 100 lbs and starting college. In that gap it feels like I've tried everything to live a healthy lifestyle, but I've just about given up. When in high school I also suffered from bulimia; even at 100 lbs considered myself to be overweight. 

2011 - 100 lbs, ran cross country in high school. Never ate breakfast or lunch (usually no money for food) but ate dinner. 

2012 - 115 lbs, slightly bummed out with my weight but didn't do anything about it because I figured it was a healthy weight to be at. Also used my unlimited access to food at college as an excuse. 

2013 - Beginning of this year I end up being 125 lbs and begin going to the gym religiously, eating scraps, etc. By the second half of the year I'm down to 108. Because of certain situations I start having suicidal ideations. By the end of 2013 I'm committed to a facility for about a week. I also receive a job offer to work for a year before returning to school, which I gladly accept so I can take a break from school stresses while earning some extra cash. 

2014 - Still 108-110 lbs. I'm pleased with my weight, and I am on meds which make me feel much better. I move to a southern state for work, and everyone is obsessed with my weight and how small I am. Everyone says how they're going to feed me and make me chubby before the year is up. They are joking around, but do make sure I eat. By June I am around 120 lbs. Feeling self conscious of my weight and decide to hit the gym but I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. During this year I also take up drinking, HEAVILY. I am plastered all the time, always blacked out, not taking my meds, and just being very irresponsible. This is not my typical personality at all. This leads me to eat fast food all the time as well. By the end of the year I'm at around 130 lbs, the biggest I've ever been. I take a family trip out of the country and everyone is seriously shocked at my weight gain. No one holds back comments, and it makes me feel like shit.

2015 - I'm back at school. I've never been so self conscious about my weight. I begin lurking loseit, xxfitness, and fitness subreddits. I want to lose that weight but instead of refusing to eat/working out obsessively I decide this time I am going to do it the healthy way. I get about 5 personal training sessions to learn about weight training. Discover I LOVE it. (I used to do XC but at this point I'm so over cardio.) However, by my summer internship I'm at 150 lbs. I joined a gym and workout at least 3 times a week, but I'm also eating like shit and drinking a lot so I don't really lose the weight. After the semester started I try to get my shit together - I eat as healthy as I possibly can, I try to incorporate some cardio/weight training at least 3 times a week, and by the end of October I'm at 144! Small difference, but still something. Since then... I don't know. I have no motivation. Never go to the gym anymore, only eat shit, and leave my house as little as possible in order to avoid running into people that are used too 100 lb me. So now here I am, 155 lbs, and stuck. 

I feel as if whenever I try to make a lifestyle change I try to go all out at once, making me feel super burned out. Basically I have no idea what to do anymore, and how to do it safely. I know I need to eat less calories than I burn, but I have ZERO self control right now. I feel like I don't even know myself, that I'm a completely different person. I hate myself. I hate what I look like, I just hate everything. I feel like if I don't make a change soon I'll be committed again by summer. 

So I'm posting here as a last resort, I have no idea how to make these changes. I thought I did but I'm just not sure anymore. I'm graduating this May and decided that I want to lose at least 20 lbs by then. I not currently working out but I just bought a pass for the community gym (all it has are treadmills, an elliptical, some dumbbells). I am currently at home and none of my family members workout/eat healthy (which makes it so much harder for me to say no to a fast food run). When at school I live with my boyfriend, who can eat anything in the world yet remain extremely thin. He does not work out at all. 

I just aspire to be someone who is healthy. I want to eat healthy, work out, and just overall improve my lifestyle. 

How do I get back into the groove of working out/eating healthy without breaking the bank or feeling burned out? Please, please, please help me. I'm sorry for the wall of text, I just needed to get this out somewhere. Any tips at all are welcome! I have begun to cut out alcohol and only drink an occasional beer here and there.

I already thought of some stuff that i should say, but i'm really looking into gathering more things to say because this is my first time doing it.


I work in customer service in a medium-sized company. I like working here, but it is not related to what i'm doing at university (computer science). I made an interview to work in one of the best companies of the world and they called me. It is a job position that will have to do with what i'm studying and is full of oportunities.


The problem is that people here in this company i am really likes me, since i'm their best intern (confirmed by the company indicators) and they want me to work at their development area next year, so they were really counting on me.


About what i said above, my boss said that the manager from the developer area would talk to me to summarize what would be my tasks, but he still didn't talk to me, i've been waiting this for like 1-2 months.


So i really decided to take that oportunity at the other company and go for it. Any tips to how to tell my boss about it?

   
**tl;dr**: People on my current job count on me. I was called to another job with great opportunities and related to my university studies. I need tips from you to know if what i tought is the right thing to say.


EDIT: i don't know if this is the right place of reddit to ask this, but i like it here."

I don't really have a good resume(Going to ask someone to help me with it), but I do have the talent to do things. I've built out a few concept UI apps such as Instamaterial(Connected using the official Instagram API) and a live twitter feed with material design and some others. I'm working on one more thing on the side as well, but that's not too important right now. So as I search for more and more development jobs, a lot of them require a BA/BS in Computer Science. Unfortunately I've not gone through college and didn't complete high school due to my school literally losing all my grades on my last year. I was going to get my GED at the beginning of the year since I didn't expect to get this job, but because I did I could never squeeze in the time to study since I was always doing freelance work and still till this day I am. I was wondering if I should be worried about minimal requirements as I've heard some stories of people in similar(not as crucial as mine) situations."
3xz4bm,2,2015-12-23,[23/M] Questions about a career,Balpenpotlood,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/3xz4bm/23m_questions_about_a_career/,"Hello. I decided to post here because I don't really know where else to post, and because I think the people here understand me the best.

Last year I graduated with a master's degree in English and Dutch literature &amp; linguistics. Currently I'm doing a 1-year postgraduate teacher training course, so I can become a language teacher. But I'm really not sure that I want to be that.

The main point is that I feel stuck. I am 23, and I don't feel as if I have accomplished anything, and being a teacher won't let me accomplish anything either. I feel like I am made for greater things than just be a language teacher, on a dead career, with no prestige in society. It used to not bother me at all, I figured you should do what you want to do right? But many of my friends are now starting to make a career and have promising futures ahead of them and it's starting to get to me. I feel like I'm failing myself.

Being a teacher is a fun job, I've taught some classes as part of my training and it was fun! But it's a lot of hard work for no recognition. And I'm sure I would be a good teacher, I've only gotten positive criticism from my mentors and I enjoy standing in front of a classroom, it's just that I'm just not sure that I *want* to be a teacher.

But I don't know what else to do, and I feel trapped. I feel super trapped. If I'm not going to be a language teacher, what else can I be? A random worker in the private sector? Many of my friends with the same degree as mine but who decided not to be teacher are doing somewhat shitty jobs in the private sector. That's not an option.

So many things have been going through my head. The only constant is fleeing everything. Just, really, throwing my laptop in the garbage can and getting. the. fuck. out. of my current life.

Options that have been going through my head the last half year:

*I could make a dash to the french foreign legion, and become a soldier. It's probably going to suck, at least in the beginning, but I'll also be outside, active, and -doing- something with my life. I'll also be part of something greater than myself.

*I could become a religious worker/chaplain. It took a long time, 6 years, but I turned from an agnost into a catholic (yes). I've already went to the faculty of theology to get into contact for this, and in May I'm going to do a internship as a chaplain in a local prison, to see if I like it. However, if I actually wanted to be a professional chaplain, I'd have to study for three more years part-time. The plan was that I could then be a part-time language teacher to fund the studies and get an income, as I no longer want to be dependant on my parents.

*I could become a monk and spent the rest of my life in the local abbey (for real, I've gone there on a spiritual retreats for a total of two weeks in the last year and a half and I've enjoyed it, but it's pretty extreme).

*I could enter politics and gain power and personal satisfaction that way, but I'm not sure I could make that

*I could become a priest, move to Rome, become a part of the staff in the Vatican and raise through the ranks

Some of these options are more ludicrous than others, but they are just things going through my head because I feel super stuck. I feel like I have nowhere to go. None of the options above are ideal. I probably can't go to the legion, because I have glasses and shit, I'm not a soldier, be real. I have a degree in linguistics and literature. I don't really want to be priest, because eventhough I don't have a girlfriend and have never been very succesful with girls, the celibate life is a thorn in my side and really, it's the 21st century, who becomes a priest these days?

I don't know what to do. It's been good for me to write this out. If you want to call me a retard because of the listed options, please, I know, but I'm desperately looking for an alternative because I really don't know what to do.

What would you guys do if you were in my position? I feel like time is running out on me, and I feel like I'm failing myself."
3xz92d,7,2015-12-23,Front office aspirations,Burquegreyhound,baseball,https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/3xz92d/front_office_aspirations/,I have been around baseball ever since I was five and played some college baseball and I finally decided I want to act on what I think is a pipe dream for me. I have been learning some sabermetrics jargon and understanding what stats are showing what in players. I have also started learning some computer programming as I have seen most require some knowledge of SQL and Python. I have also begun writing my own blog to discuss my thoughts on what is going on in baseball and I want to launch that soon. Does anyone else have any advice on what else I can be doing to make myself a competitive candidate for internships for pro teams?

I just got admitted to case '20 via EA. I am planning to major in computer science potentially minor or second major In music.  I have a few questions about these programs: 

1. Is there a difference between how rigorous is the computer science program for both ba and bs? Does it leave enough time to pursue a minor or second major in music?

2. I looked at the first destination survey results and it seems that nearly all graduates of computer science go to the workforce and that it does not seem like anyone is going to grad school. Is this true?

3. Internships and coops: what are some of the common companies where CS students are placed?

""There's going to be repercussions for this."" Bartleby warned.

""You bet there are."" Baggam declared joyfully.

""You're happy?"" Bartleby asked, incredulous of the fact.

""Absolutely. Don't you see what this means?"" 

""Of course."" Bartleby replied, brimming with confidence. ""Um. Well, actually no.""

""It means they never expected me to stand trial."" Baggam replied. ""It means that they're going to be as unprepared as I am. It means that they're going to have to fight me on the ground from here on out. They gave up the element of surprise.""

""They didn't give up anything. They tried to kill you."" Bartleby argued. ""And, you now they're going to try again.""

""Yes. But now, I know they're trying to kill me. Better still, I know which house is trying to kill me. I've fought wars with less."" Baggam declared. ""Think about it, Bartleby. What do you think they hoped to accomplish. In the media, they can make me look like an incompetent monster, but in conclave, the most they can hope to accomplish is an undermining of my authority. They can't enforce a verdict handed down by Inquisitor Lo.""

""They can strip you of your command, Sir."" Bartleby argued, fearful the Commander was needlessly making light of the situation.

""No, they can't."" Baggam argued back. He could see the doubt on Bartleby's face. ""Okay, let me put it like this. What happens if they find me unfit for duty. Like a grievance, they have to sustain the verdict. Only three entities--the Daimyo, the Central Senate, and the Emperor--can do that. Only those three can sustain a civil court judgment of this magnitude. 

""The Daimyo is dead. The Emperor is missing. Only the Senate can handle something like this, and they won't. They won't because it will draw to much attention to the fact that the Emperor is missing. If they tried to impeach me,"" Baggam warned, ""every last man and woman in the Empire would stop to watch the proceedings.

""It would be tantamount to handing the Elder Siblings a major victory. The Senate can't afford a loss like that. They can't enforce this, so why go through the charade? The answer is, they never planned to.""

""I don't know, Sir."" Bartleby countered. ""Your assumption comes with a big risk. What if that's not their play?  You're gambling with a lot of lives. No one else can lead this fleet the way you can. They'll have some kind of back up plan in case the assassination failed. They'd bee fools not to. If it's House Diederoi plotting this, they didn't do it alone, and they've been planning it for quite some time. If it were me, I'd have contingencies. 

""If this truly is a plot by the Elders, then their plan--whatever it is--depends on stripping you of power. One way or another, they'll have to remove you."" Bartleby reasoned. 

""Their plan doesn't revolve around me losing power. It revolves around a weak plot to engage the Central Senate."" Baggam corrected.

""You're fixating, Sir. You've got tunnel vision where this is concerned. Granted, you're probably right, but it doesn't feel right. What if they have another way to remove you from power?"" Bartleby asked pointedly.

""They don't."" Baggam growled.

""But, they might. I'm just saying, keep an open mind."" Bartleby urged. Baggam's reply was a grunt and a shrug. 

The transport gently lurched, pulling Bartleby from the discussion. Baggam's reply wasn't the reassurance the Aide was hoping for, but it was better than nothing. He twisted about, and peered out the driver's windshield. The shuttle was slowing down like it was preparing to land. 

""We there?"" He asked. 

The Guin driving nodded and pointed to a pub in the middle of the crossroads ahead. The shuttle touched down with a little bump a few store fronts away. The crossroads was far to busy for her to get them any closer. 

The moment the shuttle was down, the driver slipped from her seat and hurried around the shuttle to open their door. It was a refreshing courtesy. One in every hundred dwarves might have performed it. Of course, that one dwarf only would have done it to solicit a tip. 

Bartleby waved his consumer badge across the reader she presented to settle the fare, then dropped a few cron in her open palm in gratitude. She seemed amused by this. 

""You didn't expect a tip?"" He asked.

""Not really. The damn dwarves really lower expectations all across the board. He considered that and dropped a few more in her palm then smiled as a new thought popped inside his head.

""How much would you charge to take us to Savinbrod?"" Bartleby asked. The Guin started in surprise.

""That's all the way across the ship and five hundred levels down."" She replied.

""How much?"" Bartleby asked.

""For the pair of ya?"" She asked. Bartleby shrugged but nodded. 

""How much?"" He asked.

""Twelve hundred cron."" She replied squeamishly. Bartleby winced. 

""Fine. I want you to take a trip across the ship."" He said, running his badge across the scanner again. ""I don't want you to stop till you reach the barracks at Savinbrod. When you reach it, give this to the duty officer."" He pulled a dagger from a sheath on his forearm.

""That's it? You just want me to give some knight a knife?"" 

""That's it. You make twelve hundred cron for giving a knife to a knight. That work for you?"" He asked. Her grin grew.

""Oh, that definitely works for me, pretty boy."" She replied, smacking his cheek playfully. 

She hurriedly dodged back around the transport and slipped back inside. A moment later, she was lifting off, giving Bartleby a flirtatious wink while she did. Bartleby dipped his head, then turned away with Baggam. The pair made a beeline for the tavern. Behind them, the shuttle lifted off and sped away. 

Bartleby glanced back when he reached the tavern to make sure the driver was truly gone. He didn't want her to know their true destination which lay just beyond the tavern. 

He'd given her the bar's address in case the Ministry guards tracked her down. It was a fortuitous precaution. At the time, he hadn't really expected them to come looking for them. But now that they knew William was William, they'd be coming for Baggam in force. The Aide searched the corridor for curious eyes then hurriedly changed direction when he didn't find any. Baggam followed his lead.

""You will be paying me back for that, right?"" Bartleby asked.

""Expense it."" Baggam quipped. 

""Is that allowed?"" Bartleby asked in surprise.

""Will you focus."" Baggam growled. ""How do you know how long they've been planning this?""

""She noticed the time stamp on the petition--my friend, I mean. It was signed before the Summit. One rotation before actually."" Bartleby replied. ""If House Diederoi is behind the grievance, then they've been plotting this since before the incident with Daniel at the Summit. They filed it before anything with the harvest went wrong. It was like they knew this harvest was going to blow up in our faces."" Baggam mulled that over then shook his head. He didn't agree. They reached the reprinting facility and pushed their way through the lobby doors.

""You're forgetting something momentous that happened before the Summit."" Baggam said. ""The Daimyo was assassinated. It was overshadowed by what happened at the Summit, but it was most definitely before. That's the only reason their plan has a chance. The Daimyo is gone. The Emperor is gone. It left them an open path to the Senate. If they win a judgment against me, it'll force the Senate to acknowledge publicly that the Emperor is missing. The Elder Siblings can't just announce it themselves. Right now, their power is limited. If they start throwing accusations around, the Senate will just denounce them. But if they can get me in court, they'll have the stage they need to win public support.

""The Elders need the support of the people. They need the support of the army. They need the Central Senate to admit that the Emperor is missing all on their own. If they can get them to publicly acknowledge the fact, then they can bring their charge against the Senate. They can force the Senate to acknowledge that the Emperor is gone.

""If the Senate refuses to declare the Emperor dead, then public sentiment will shift and split. We'll have a civil war on our hands."" Baggam predicted. ""It'll be the end of the Empire Choan Vaat built.""

""I have the greatest respect for you, Sir, but aren't you placing a little too much importance on your role in all of this?"" Bartleby asked. ""You haven't been to Cojo since before Sylar.""

""It doesn't matter."" Baggam groused. ""My position is impactful."" 

""So is an all meat diet."" Bartleby fired back. 

Baggam gave him a sour look and let the lobby door swing shut behind him. There were three doors coming off the lobby, and three people reading tablets seated on benches in the waiting area. The only other person present was a bored looking red headed woman seated behind a counter across from the door. 

""Where the hell is he?"" Baggam demanded of the receptionist. She looked up in surprise. Bartleby sighed and took the lead, approaching the counter with as disarming a smile as he could muster.

""Hello."" Bartleby greeted, a patient smile splayed across his face. ""This is my first time here.""

The woman behind the counter sighed heavily and looked almost as bored as the Guin that drove them there. She slowly reached forward and pressed a black button on the counter between them. A holographic head suddenly appeared accompanied by a jaunty little jingle. The hologram was of a old grandmotherly woman with bouncy brown curls, warm eyes, and an inviting smile.

*Welcome to Rejuv-the-Nation. The premiere destination for everything dying. At Rejuv-the-Nation, everyone gets that second chance they always wished for. Maybe your body has begun to sag. Perhaps you have an unsightly blemish marring your beauty. At Rejuv-the-Nation, we take away your worries and give you the body nature denied you.* 

*Did daddy's little princess take too many pills? Did Mommy die in child birth? Did a jealous lover overreact? Was he a good soldier that died for his country? Did you just want the pain to stop? We understand, and we don't judge. We just make it better, because we can bring them all back. And, we'll bring them back better than they were before.*

*We'll take away the scars. We'll take away the wrinkles. We'll take away those aching joints, that missing leg, and give you that smile life cheated you out of. We'll make it all better and fix the mistakes only nature could make. This is the Rejuv-the-Nation guarantee.*

*Rejuv-the-Nation, keeping families together when no one else can.* 

The look Baggam gave the woman behind the counter had her recoiling in fear. 

""You think this is funny?"" Baggam growled.

Baggam reached through the holographic head smiling back at them. He grabbed the woman behind the counter by her smock front and pulled her across the counter. 

""It was an ad, Sir. It wasn't personal."" Bartleby declared, slipping his arms between the receptionist and Baggam.

""Where is he?"" Baggam growled.

""W-Who are you . . . looking for?"" The red head asked nervously. Bartleby carefully pried the two apart. Baggam released her with a little shove.

""He's a bit touchy about the leg."" Bartleby apologized. ""You're reprinting a man named Daniel Sojourner. He's a government contract. There's probably a lot of knights loitering around his room. We need to speak with him immediately."" 

""B-Bed 32."" The receptionist stammered, pointing toward the wall to her right. 

""Much obliged."" He responded, leading the way. Baggam gave the little red head one last hard look then stomped after his Aide. ""You didn't have to scare the little minx."" 

""I did, and I make no apologies for it."" Baggam snapped. ""Where are all the others?"" Bartleby pushed open the door the receptionist indicated for Baggam and woke up his NID.

""The Baron and his men are up ahead. Aaron and Kalala are up ahead. Pemphero, Margo, and Abbot Brumchild are up ahead. Prince Ogct and General Shar are two neighborhoods off and coming fast. Baako is up ahead. And, Luke is one neighborhood away and coming quick. He was bringing Ciyth with him. Did I miss anyone?"" Bartleby asked.

""Jocosa."" Baggam grumbled.

""It will take her a little longer. She was training acolytes at the temple in Parv Berdu. It's usually a knell by skiff, but with the quarantine in effect, she'll have to come through the ship. She's looking at about two knell. I think that's everyone though.""

""Speaking of the quarantine. What's the status on that? And, did the Baron bring any men with him?"" Baggam asked.

""The reports of incapacitations peaked yesterday around mid-rotation. The rate has slowed since with only a few dozen being reported each hour. The Grey Guard, the Imperial troops, and the knights are all on alert. They're scooping up everyone who collapses as ordered. As far as the Baron goes, I don't know. There are a lot of NID signatures clustered up around the bend in the hall. I recognize a few of them. Some of them are with the Dame's security detail."" Bartleby revealed.

""Better and better."" Baggam growled, stomping forward. He round the bend only to find a dozen knights laid out in the hall before him. They appeared to be alive and breathing, but they were covered in sweat and exhausted. ""What the hell is happening here?""

""I-I don't know."" Bartleby replied. 

Baggam picked his way through the downed knights and entered the only door left. Bartleby knelt and checked the vitals of the knights he passed. Inside the room, Baggam found a dozen more knights with their faces drenched in sweat, their teeth clenched tight, and their eyes pinched shut. As he watched, one of them began to sway. A Med Tech rushed over to the man and caught him as he toppled over.

""What the hell is going on?"" Baggam growled heatedly. The Med Tech who'd caught the knight scurried over to where the Commander stood.

""They're trying to smother his will, Sir."" The Med Tech replied, pointing to the figure strapped to the bed. It was Daniel.

Baggam surveyed the room. There were over three dozen neural dampeners in the room. Five of them suddenly overloaded, exploding in a shower of sparks as he watched. Two other Med Techs scurried out of the back room with three more dampeners in their hands. The immediately replaced the damaged ones, throwing the destroyed ones on a knee-high pile of broken dampeners piled against the far wall.

""I'm going to need an explanation."" Baggam commanded, searching the struggling men and women arrayed around Daniel's bed for a familiar face. 

The three Weapon Masters he recognized. They stood shoulder to shoulder down the left side of Daniel's bed. They had their hands pressed against his chest and head, and they were every bit as lathered as the other knights. Keflan was kneeling to the right side of the bed. His huge hand gripped Daniel around the middle. Abbot Brumchild was at the foot with both of Daniel's legs gripped in his meaty fist. The rest of the knights had their hands lying on the shoulder of the knight before them, and all of them were pushing themselves to the limit.

""Speak damn it."" Baggam barked. The Med Tech at his elbow started with surprise then dove into what was happening in the room.

""T-They made me put a parasite in his h-head, Sir."" The Med Tech stammered, his stringy black hair was soaked with sweat and plastered to his scalp, testifying to how long he'd be at it. ""The subject had been reprinted before--many times in fact. I tried to tell--""

""I know that already. I authorized it. Tell me what the hell they're doing to him."" Baggam snapped.

""The Dame put him to sleep, but she couldn't keep him asleep. He keeps trying to wake up, but every time he tries, he starts to lose control. They're struggling to keep him . . . sedated."" The Tech explained. ""They have to do it several times each rotation. It was easier when the big man with the curly brown hair was present, but he was called away. We keep having to bring in more and more knights to smother his will. It's very distressing, Sir. We're almost out of neural dampeners. I've had to send one my interns to the warehouse to bring back as many dampeners as he can find. It's been very exciting, Sir. Very exciting."" 

""How long do the attacks last?"" Baggam asked. The Med Tech thought it over. 

""Usually another eight knights will drop before the episode passes. The time between attacks keeps shortening though. Last time it was two knell. This one is nearly over."" The Tech predicted. Three knights groaned aloud and dropped, one after the other. The two Med Techs setting up the neural dampeners hurried over to them and began dragging them out into the hall with the others.

""Why don't you go help them."" Baggam ordered, motioning for Bartleby to assist the Techs. 

Bartleby obeyed without question, while Baggam drifted over to where the knights struggled to keep Daniel down. He slipped between Keflan and another knight, cozying up to Daniel's bedside. He wanted to see Daniel up close for himself. He wanted to see the monster that was about to tear the Empire apart. Three more knights wilted to the floor. Baggam ignored them.

""Why'd you do it?"" Baggam asked sorrowfully. ""Why'd you kill him. Why'd you kill the Emperor?"" His words were barely more than a whisper, but they struck a chord in Daniel. They cut through the psychic battle and reached the man inside. 

The knights all gasped in unison and staggered back. Daniel had given up the fight. 

""Look what your lies have done to me. You took my leg. You took my vigor. You took it all away and for what? Why'd you kill Choan Vaat?"" Baggam wasn't expecting answers to his questions. He just needed to say the words.

""It's all clear now, Commander."" The Med Tech announced. ""The episode is over. He'll be down for a couple of knell."" 

The knights all dropped to one knee but it wasn't out of respect for their Commander. They just were just too weak to stand any longer.

""Baron?"" Baggam called. ""The mission I authorized you to undertake is cancelled. I have an eye witness that will testify that your brother murdered Choan--""

""The Emperor lives."" The words were barely audible, but they were loud enough to freeze the Commander in place. Baggam turned his attention back to Daniel. The former Prior's lips were moving but nothing was coming out.

""Say that again."" Baggam ordered, leaning in close so he could hear.

""Choan. Vaat. Lives. On. Jolliox."" Daniel breathed, pushing out each word with effort.

""He's alive?"" Baggam sighed in disbelief. ""The Emperor is alive?""

""Jolliox."" Daniel repeated. ""Jolliox. Jolliox. Jolliox!""

""The Emperor's on Jolliox?"" Baggam asked excitedly. ""He's really alive?"" He grabbed the medical gown Daniel was wrapped in and pulled him close much as he had the receptionist. ""Say it aloud so they can all hear, and don't youlie to me, boy. Gods damn you, don't you fucking lie to me. Is he really on Jolliox?""

Daniel's eyes flew open without warning even as the straps that held his wrist and ankles let go. Before Baggam could pull away and before the knights could stop him, Daniel's hands shot up and grabbed Baggam by the head. The former Prior's whole body began to vibrate and spasm, and to Baggam's horror, Daniel spoke again.

""Jolliox!"" Daniel roared, pouring his will into the Commander. He shouted the word over and over again, while knights and Med Techs beat on him and tried to tear Baggam free of his grip, but it was like his hands were welded to the sides of Baggam's head.

Baggam jerked and thrashed wildly, like he was having a seizure; like he was be electrocuted. And nothing they did, could make Daniel let go. The Battle Commander's eyes slowly rolled up into his head until only the whites were showing, and blood-flecked foam formed in the corners of his mouth.

Knights threw their will at Daniel, and he shook them off like they weren't even there. The neural dampeners overloaded in pairs. Witch lights burst in showers of green flame. Steel walls bowed out. Ceiling panels popped loose. Decking steel ripped open. Reprinting equipment exploded in a shower of sparks. One knight was hurled across the room. Abbot Brumchild was sent smashing into the ceiling. He stayed there, pressed against the panels by Daniel's will. And all the while, men and women pulled at Daniel's arms without effect. 

It was Bartleby who ended it. He drew a blank from the holster of one of his sister knights and swung it at Daniel's temple with all his might. It ended the fight, but not how any of them thought it would. The moment it made contact with Daniel's skull, Daniel disintegrated, dissolving into a golden cloud of atoms that trailed after the blank in Bartleby's hand. 

The cloud golden dust was swept into the crowd of knights and through them, only to coalesce into Daniel once more. The Abbot was suddenly free of Daniel's influence and came crashing down atop several of the knights.

Some of the knights tended to Baggam, but the rest just stared at Daniel, their expressions unreadable.

""Daniel?"" Aaron called from the doorway. The shouts had drawn him in from one of the other rooms.

""What's happening to me?"" Daniel asked in a frightened voice. He stood alone, everyone else slowly backing away ""What the hell is hap--"" He broke into a cloud of atoms again. The cloud exploded out into the room, filling every corner then re-coalesced in a different spot. When it was done, Daniel was whole again. 

""What's is this?"" He asked, searching the faces of the other knights. He looked pleadingly into the eyes of his little brother. Gorjjen pushed through the crowd.

""I don't know."" Gorjjen murmured.  ""I don't know, but we'll figure it out."" Daniel broke into a cloud of atoms once more. This time they didn't scatter. They swirled in place like angry bees. A moment later, Daniel was back, rematerializing in the same spot he'd just left.

""Oh dear."" A new voice sang merrily. ""It's already begun."" All eyes went to the door and speaker. The woman who spoke was handcuffed and under guard. The smug all-knowing smile she wore looked out of place on Leia's face.

""What the hell is happening to me, Baako?"" Daniel asked hotly.

""Nothing that hasn't happened a thousand times before. You're remembering."" She replied. ""Don't worry. It'll pass."" He exploded into a cloud of atoms again and rematerialized inches from her face. She kissed the tip of his nose. ""Welcome back lover.""

""What the hell is happening to me!"" Daniel exclaimed, wrapping both his hands around her throat.

""Careful, Daniel. You'll want to stay calm. One stray thought, and you'll rematerialize outside this ship."" She warned, laughing gaily. 

""You did this to me."" He accused.

""Oh, Daniel. I was the one who *kept* you from doing this."" She replied, stroking his cheek affectionately. ""You'll remember in time. For right now, I'd start thinking calm thoughts. You can't control it when you're scared.""

""What did he do to the Commander?"" Bartleby asked, going to his knees beside Baggam. The Commander was still spasming.

""I-I didn't mean . . . He blamed me for . . ."" Daniel grabbed at his head and screamed then promptly sank through the deck.

Everyone in the room was left staring into the eyes of the others. No one seemed to have an answer or an explanation to what had just happened.

""Where'd he go?"" Ailig asked, edging over to the spot Daniel had just vacated. He drew his sword, fully intending to cut the Jujen Queen down if she didn't answer.

""Down. Up. Left. Right. Earth. Cojo. Jolliox. It's really hard to tell when he's like this. There really isn't a limit for him."" Baako replied witheringly. The looks they awarded her were filled with a mixture of emotion--shock, surprise, fear, incredulity, but mostly wonder.

""You knew he could do this?"" Margo asked threateningly.

""Did I know? Why do you think I fell in love with him, Sweetie?"" Baako asked laughingly. 

""Where do you think he went?"" Aaron asked.

""Hard to say, Aaron. He seemed really interested in some place called Jolliox, didn't he?"" Baako asked playfully.

""He sank through the deck."" Aaron argued. ""He's still on the ship."" Baako shook her head sadly.

""Probably, but will he stay here. I gave him the control he needed to deal with this. That's why I was in his head. I don't know what he's going to do now, silly goose. He's got that bitch of his in his head now. If she can't reign him in, there literally nothing he can't do. He's remembering, Aaron, and he's just getting started. Pretty soon, he's going to remember why I took his memories in the first place."" Baako warned.

""Why'd you take his memories, Baako?"" Kalala asked, pushing her into the room.

""To save his life."" She replied, all of the humor going out of the queen at the sight of Lira's host.

""Explain."" Kalala ordered.

""Daniel is two-faced. He's a Janus. He's a Gemini. He has a twin."" Baako warned.

""God dammit, speak clearly."" Aaron snapped.

""Daniel has a twin."" Baako seethed bitingly. ""He reprinted himself while he was still alive to give your precious Emperor a host to live in. That was our deal. I don't kill your Emperor, and Daniel submits to me.""

""What do you mean a host?"" Baggam asked from the floor. He was beginning to recover from Daniel's attack.

""I mean host."" Baako repeated.

""Why would Choan Vaat need a host?"" Pemphero asked.

""Because, he's a symbiote."" She replied, her smug smile re-emerging. No one said a word at first. What could they say. 

""There is no fucking way that's true."" Baggam growled.

""Well, actually . . ."" Keflan chimed in. ""That would . . . actually make a lot of sense, Sir.""

""There's no way Choan Vaat is a fucking worm."" Baggam snapped.

""He might be."" Gorjjen argued. ""I had the squire research the Emperor, Commander. What Baako says fits with what he found.""
Baggam turned on the Weapon Master like he'd just betrayed him. The look Gorjjen returned him was filled with sympathy, but that melted away in wonder once more.

""Your eye."" Gorjjen breathed, reaching out toward the Commander's face.

""What of it?"" He snapped, realizing only at the last moment that he could see out it again. 

He pawed at his face and waved his hand before it. He could see it clear as day. Baggam searched the room, spotting a reflective surface on the side of one of the machines. He hurried over and peered at his reflection. The cloudiness had gone out of the eye. It was as bright and clear as the other. As he watched, the scar tissue above his once injured eye began to sprout hair as the eyebrow regrew.

""What'd he do to me?"" Baggam asked emotionally.

""He fixed you."" Baako replied. ""As I said, nothing is beyond him now.""

3xzfew,31,2015-12-23,Neckbeard and the police,uv-vis,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/3xzfew/neckbeard_and_the_police/,"So this is another good story about the NB in my life. Thankfully no innocent m'ladies were hurt in this story (Pedobeard's mom's feelings did get hurt however), and no one was sent to the friendzone.

Cast

uv-vis: Still a student at this point, going onto the 5th year of University (I know...). I took little to no part in this story aside from being a witness.

otaku1: from the name you can tell he loves japanese culture (japanese speech club, anime/game clubs etc) a good friend to this day.

asshole: Sarcastic shit disturber, but makes everyone laugh, we all love him.

nerdfriend: The one with the highest GPA, the one who never skips class and studies at least a week before an exam. Another good friend from high school.

buffguy: another friend from high school in the same year of uni as us, works out alot, really nice to all his friends.

Pedobeard: Typical neckbeard behaviour. Typing everything wrong with him gets repetitive (Sorry!)

So it was the summer of the end of my 4th year of university. At this point sad to say most of us were still in school. I had switched from a bio-sci to a chemistry degree and had to take an extra year, because I suck and basically gave up on medical school and I liked my prospects better. Otaku1, asshole, buffguy all switched to business school doing finance or accounting (good choice), nerdfriend could have graduated but took an extra year of random courses just so he can apply to medical schools again, and Pedobeard was one year below us so he was still trying to become the doctor again.


So anyways during the summer right after we finished all our exams, we were all hella broke, so we all needed part time jobs or at least someway to pay for our spending over the summer. Ofc we all found pretty good places to work over the summer, well except me ofc, I got to wash dishes at a greasy pizza place. But anyways, Pedobeard was lazy as f*ck as usual but luckily Mombeard and Dadbeard were pretty experienced professionals and dadbeard got him hired to do admin work at an engineering firm in a suburb that's only a 10 minute drive away. This son of a fuck (no disrespect to his parents) got hooked up with an $18/hr part time job and he COMPLAINED about his parents forcing him to work and nagging him?! To put that into perspective I make just over minimum wage ($10/hr?) washing dishes, and the year before when I did a lab internship I made even less than that. So hearing him complain about almost a liveable wage kinda made me mad.


So the summer goes on as usual, we all do our things, occasionally meet for dinner/drinks, see movies. On most friday nights when we dont have to get up in the morning we all game at night together and chat over skype. So one night while we were playing together (Warcraft III Dota, this was before Dota 2 was released) we were just having a good time, when all of a sudden we hear Pedobeards parents over his mike. It wasn't very clear but the gist of the conversation was Mombeard telling him to stop gaming, he has to get up to go to work at 8AM and it was 1230AM already. Mind you, I love my parents, but nagging does bother me also, but Mombeard was pretty reasonable here, if I were him I would have just said ""okay sorry mom!, last game and I'll go to bed"". However Pedobeard decides to stand up and give out a really long annoyed SIGH and proceed to yell ""Go away! I can do whatever I want! I don't care if I don't wake up early for work!"" At this point we were all really uncomfortable to say the least. I was actually a little upset, people being disrespected especially when they don't deserve it is one of my pet peeves. So anyways all we hear over skype is a door slamming and then we continue awkwardly.. then 5 minutes later, we hear some loud ass yelling from dadbeard and pedobeard trying to stop him and then after a brief moment, pedobeard stops moving his character in game and then just disconnects altogether, he also disconnects from skype. We all had an idea of what happened, and turns out his dad SMASHED his laptop. He stopped coming to hang out with us, we even invite him to social gatherings but nope he never comes out, just at home being upset. According to otaku1 (otaku1, buffguy, nerdfriend live in the same neighbourhood) instead of creeping/gaming on his laptop, he spends his time on his ps3.


We all thought w/e this wont last long, his dad did feel a little bad and payed for his computer screen to get fixed, it just took 3 weeks to ship back and forth. So fast forward to the next week on a Friday. A few months back, I started seeing someone, so I was home late after dropping off m'lady and I had missed most of our nightly gaming session. I checked skype and it turns out no one was talking to eachother, so I thought it was a little strange. I messaged otaku1 and asked if he was up to play a few rounds, and his response was, ""Pedobeard is the biggest f*ckin idiot I have met in my entire life"". So what else is new? So after asking what was up, turns out this retard had an arguement at dinner, his parents expected him to be more productive and comment on how he is so miserable without games and internets, and would it kill him to go out and play some sports or some shit. You can probably imagine how the arguement went. At some point Pedobeard tried to just walk out the door, and then his parents blocked off the door saying that he can't just run away from this discussion. And then Pedobeard went up to his room and called the POLICE on his parents (apparently for forcibly confining him). Anyways he ran out to otaku1's place and told him what happened at his front door and asked if he could stay over (his parents and siblings were on extended vacations in different places again) he basically said ""fuck off"" and slammed his door. The next place he went to was nerdfriend's place, he was really uncomfortable, but he didn't like refusing friends so he let him stay there meanwhile but not the night. Otaku also told me he wanted to get everyone together to have an impromptu meeting to discuss his feelings (pity party) at a McDonalds. So nerdfriend called me and said, ""Hey wanna go to get Mcdonalds! Everyone's going!"" (he didn't know that otaku1 told me everything). My response was, ""I don't know, a group of hooligans at McDonalds at 1Am? Someone might call the Police"". And of course he was on speaker phone so Pedobeard could lurk. All I heard was an aggravated ""OH MY GOD!"" and then nerdfriend saying, I should probably go.


So anyhoo fast forwarding to the next morning, talking to Otaku about the McDonalds meeting (all hearsay from this point, I had Pizza and 1.5 servings of dessert earlier and I would have been updated on Pedobeard later anyways). Apparently Asshole was being a giant dick to Pedobeard telling him to calm the fuck down and that his parents were pretty reasonable/patient with him. Pedobeard, being the arrogant motherlover he is, told everyone to go fuck themselves etc. Buffguy, who thought Pedobeard had gotten kicked out and was really sympathetic and offered to let him stay over unconditionally, heard the real story and changed his mind and told him to go fuck off as well. So in the end after they all tried reasoning with him, they were all labeled bullies and ignorant for not understanding or sympathizing with him, apparently we had no real feelings or our lives were so much better than his (???). Pedobeard went home almost right after McD and the police recommended counseling for the family.


-fin-

EDIT: the formatting before made it impossible to read. 

Also to add a TLDR: Pedobeard's dad rages and smashes his computer because Pedobeard is being himself. And later Pedobeard calls the police to arrest his parents because he feels like his human rights have been violated."
3xzy0x,3,2015-12-23,Undergraduate Big Data Internships?,keepitsalty,BigDataJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigDataJobs/comments/3xzy0x/undergraduate_big_data_internships/,"Hello, I'm a current financial economics major with a minor in computer science. 

A lot of the posts I see on here and searching through google often look at Data Science and Big Data jobs through the lens of having a PhD. 

Are there many internship opportunities for undergrads? What's your experience in the industry? Should I just try to get some normal/unrelated internships and then go for a MS in stats or something?

I just need a little direction from a curious college student.

3xzyeb,3,2015-12-23,I would like advice on some thoughts I have on my questioning and also about friend/romantic interest and a fear of other peoples reaction on my actions.,MaiaNOvA,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3xzyeb/i_would_like_advice_on_some_thoughts_i_have_on_my/,"So for about 2-3 years now I have been questioning whether I am female. I have taken steps to figure this out by posting a few questions here (other accounts) and also seeing a therapist (including group sessions guided by the same therapist). All new clothes I buy are from the women's section (mostly via the internet, although a few weeks ago I bought a shirt and scarf with my sister). 

I live in the Netherlands and am going to start my ""diagnostic"" phase in January. 

The thing is, I am still not 100% sure. Yes I have taken all the above steps, but there is still this feeling that I am not actually a woman. That because of an emotionless puberty (lost in gaming, no real friends, etc.) and being depressed (I believe), that being transgender is like a fantasy where I can be happy (I can't find another way to describe this right now) 

I also don't feel physical dysphoria (besides not liking body hair). I know this isn't a requirement or anything, but it is a cause for more doubt.

Another thing is that the friends I did have in the past where always male (also never had a relationship with a woman even though I am into women) and the 1 female I am friends with..... is more of a friend by relation (girlfriend of 1 guy in the group). 

Recently though I have become somewhat closer to a girl from school who is doing her internship at the same place as me. She is a very nice person and I feel really comfortable talking with her...more so than with maybe any other person I know. 

However I can't tell the difference between liking a girl as a friend or something more and/or if I would want to look like that (so envy, i think?). 
I might be able to figure this out, but I would like to talk to someone about this.... Specifically with the girl I just mentioned, however she is the 1 person I can't really talk with about this, because it concerns her. (Do I just want to be close friends with her or do I like her as well. It really could be either one.)
How do I go about this, what do I do?


Another thing, I recently got access to some LSD. I used it with friends and had a mixed experience of mostly fun and a few bad moments. The bad being really afraid of the others seeing me do something and judging it in a bad way. Even though I know they are maybe the least judgmental people you can meet (2 of them were aware of my questioning). I already knew that a big part of why I am afraid of transitioning (besides the doubt) is that I am afraid what others will think and do (not just in relation to transition). Which was now confirmed to be true even among friends (although amplified by the LSD)
I adapt my way of talking and adapt my responses to what I believe the other person wants to hear (to a certain extent). 
How do I stop being afraid and stop adapting my way of talking to suit what I think they want to hear? 


I apologize for the long wall of text, I hope it isn't to much of a mess. 
Thank you for any insights you might have and feel free to ask me questions."
3y02qt,47,2015-12-23,Where I imagine they are now...,autumn-solace,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/3y02qt/where_i_imagine_they_are_now/,"I'm doing my 9 millionth re-watch of the series and I've been entertaining myself with imagining where some of our beloved characters have ended up. I'd love to hear what you think happened to them. This can be as silly as you'd like. Beware because there might be some spoilers in here. 

First I'll start with our favorite and most missed around here, Joe the bartender. I imagine that Joe and Walter are married and have a newly adopted baby. They got the phone call in the middle of the night and Joe had to sell the bar rather abruptly because owning a bar working those hours wouldn't allow him to be the kind of dad he wanted to be. They moved to Vermont where they own a bed and breakfast. 

Izzy Stevens - In my mind she became an OB/GYN surgeon with a special focus in gynecological oncology. She has learned some distance but still does on occasion get too close to her patients. She's divorced for the second time because she's a combative super bitch. Her divorce caused her to move clear across the country, she now works in New Jersey. She has a cat. It barely tolerates her. 

Leah Murphy - She's on the cutting edge in cancer research. While she didn't have the chops for surgery, her extremely competitive side has made her an exceedingly talented researcher. She's on the edge of a breakthrough. She's finally found the one for her - he's a super sweet reformed Mormon who pays her full attention. 

Intern Steve Mostow and Wife Meagan - Steve finally conquered those nerves and butterfingers and has become a neurologist - after all, he does have the hair for it. Meagan got pregnant for the second time during her residency and has since dropped out of the program to pursue being the best mom she can be. 

Nurse Olivia - She contracted a case of fatal extreme bitch syndrome and has succumbed to her illness. RIP in pieces Olivia. 

Eli - Eli now runs the nursing staff in a hospital in San Fransisco. His focus on patient care has earned him much recognition. In a hilarious parody of his relationship with Bailey, he's now married to the chief of surgery at his San Fransisco hospital. He was made head nurse (or whatever they're called) long before he met his wife, nepotism was never a factor in the decision. He helped save the mayor's life and to recognize his excellence in patient care was given the key to the city of San Fransisco.

Nurse Debbie - Nurse Debbie has long since retired. She occasionally picks up shifts at a local nursing home like many retired nurses tend to do. She's just welcomed her sixth grandchild into the world. Her husband died long ago which left her bitter. Her daughter bought her tickets for a singles cruise where she met Mr. Right (who is a passionate Pomeranian breeder) and is now truly happy. It is rumored that she is now seen smiling in her personal life. 

Shane Ross - He became a kick ass Cardio God like Christina, his mentor. They were sleeping together for a few years, both just trying to fill the gap in their lives. Shane then met a really cute Swiss girl who is bubbly yet morbid whom he fell completely head over heels for. He's since broken it off with Christina and is happily married without children.   

Sadie - She became a pathologist because she's way too much of a psychopath to be allowed near living patients. Her daddy pulled some strings and landed her a job somewhere in south Florida.

Sydney Heron - Sydney Heron is now in sunny Arizona where the people are a little perkier than Seattle. She was considering a paeds fellowship but found that even children were put off with her super cheerful nature. She has become the best God damn urology surgeon this side of Catherine Avery. Men are confidant that their junk is in the right hands when they encounter someone that exhaustingly happy. 

Robbins leg - It was cast aside roughly and tossed into the closet as Arizona grew another in it's place. She is the first known human this has ever happened to. No one knows this has happened besides you, me, Arizona, and the leg. It is rumored at Grey Sloan Memorial that she never even lost her leg. 

Who did I miss? What do you think happened to our favorite missing characters?"

My initial are : GG
Both works as a signature (i put an example on how i used my logo for now)

My own opinion is that the first one is more original and have more sense into it (this is my current logo) but is not that nice looking, the second is way more better looking, and it is a lettrage i have done myself (i really like to do this, so i thought maybe i should do a G in lettrage) but it is more common.

My website allows you to look up and compare weapons and armour items against each other, clearly displaying their own core stats and which item is better at what.

3y0p2a,3,2015-12-23,Getting a job out of state?,forget4,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3y0p2a/getting_a_job_out_of_state/,"Hey so I'm currently an Accounting student, or aiming to be one since I haven't been accepted into the major yet, and I want to know about getting a job out of state. I was told on here that I should wait until after I get my bachelors to worry about getting my remaining credits for the CPA, and getting internships and a job should be my main priority before the CPA as well.

I also know about the changing state licenses but it seems its not a difficult thing to change between states. My main concern is about trying to get a job on the west coast, preferably California. I live on the east coast and have always wanted to move over there but I've barely been out of state as it is. Have any accountants who have moved across a great distance within the U.S., or even across countries, had any issues with making the transition?

I'm about half way to my bachelor's so I still got about 2 years to go but honestly if it wasn't for college, I would have made the move to the west coast by now. I've also considered Boston and Philadelphia. I just really need a change once I'm done with school. Also, say I do end up getting a job out of state but don't finish my remaining credits for the CPA, is there anyway I can still cheaply go to school? I know colleges around me say you have to live here a certain amount of time before being considered in state so I feel like that could mess me up if I try going back to school in another state.

I guess this also includes anyone whos moved out of state for a job so any insight pertaining job interviews, moving, and anything else would be great."
3y0xu8,15,2015-12-23,Why aren't we talking about Jessica Jones?!,mynameis4826,Earth199999,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earth199999/comments/3y0xu8/why_arent_we_talking_about_jessica_jones/,"So, I've recently had been interning at Hogarth, Chao, and Benowitz (really high class lawyers in New York), and one of the partners, Jeri Hogarth, basically has contracted a superhero or whatever to work for us.  Her name is Jessica Jones , and while she looks pretty normal, she's wicked strong and has a nasty temper.  From what I've gathered, she works as a private eye for Alias Investigations, a detective agency in the Hell's Kitchen Area.

Me, being curious as hell, decided to do some private sleuthing on Jessica.  She was directly related to those recent cases of mind-control, setting up a support group for people who had been forced to do the mind-controller's bidding.  She basically takes no precautions with her powers (we have a running tally on the windows she smashes whenever she visits Hogarth), and doesn't use a superhero moniker or wear a costume or anything.  Also, she doesn't seem to have any contact with SHIELD or anyone big, as she lives and works out of this shitty apartment in Hell's Kitchen.

My question is, why the hell isn't anyone talking about her?!  Here we have a superhero walking around New York, just using her powers out in the open with no attempt to conceal her identity, and NO ONE'S COVERING IT.  The leaked S.H.I.E.L.D. files don't seem to have anything on her, but there's this one weird military company that keeps popping up in her history.  I've been trying to talk to people around the office, but they just keep pushing me aside, or straight-up warning me not to investigate further.

EDIT: Welp, somehow word got to Hogarth that I was sticking my nose where it shouldn't have been, and I've lost my internship.  All in the name of the truth, huh guys?

EDIT #2: So, I've been delving deeper into the case, taking with various people who've been in contact with Jessica Jones. Her neighbours seem pretty reluctant to spill the beans (though there was this one chick who looked like she really wanted to talk), but there was this one lady that messaged me from Florida who was a total goldmine for info. Apparently, she was a client for the firm I was working at, and was advised to hire Jessica Jones to keep tabs on her husband. She claimed that Jones has around a hundred contacts in the NYC area that are, shall we say, similarly gifted. My contact seemed pretty hysterical, so I don't know how much of that to believe; however, it's pretty safe to say that Jones has at least met and keeps in contact with other superhumans. I'm currently trying to find people involved with the Killgrave incident that would be willing to talk about their interactions with Miss Jones. I'll keep you guys posted.

EDIT #3: HOLY SHIT, I'VE JUST HAD A BIG BREAK, GUYS. So after I had gotten a hold of one of the regular members of the Killgrave support group, and she led me to believe that Jones and Hogarth had recently had a falling out (this was news to me, since Hogarth always acted so protective of Jones).  Just asking Hogarth what was up is kind of out of the question, so I decided to talk to Hogarth's former secretary to see what she knew. After a bit of coaxing (and a sizable amount of yule tide beverages), she started taking about Hogarth's relationship with Jones. This lady was paranoid as Hell, apparently -- she kept a file on every case she every had Jones work, including the police cases Jones has been involved in. What particularly struck my interest was Hogarth's obsession with some firm known as IGH -- the same firm that keeps showing up on Jones' history.  I'll see if I can pull just one more Christmas miracle and get a hold of those files! I'll keep you guys posted!"

I've done two internships, one school project, and one personal project for web development and all four have been done a different way (Java Spring, CGI scripting, standard html/css/javascript/php). I'm confused what the ""best"" way of making a website is, and by best I mean the most scalable. One person told me that serving static html with ajax is the best, but my job told me not to do that and use cgi scripting mixed with ajax for ""lazy loading"", because ajax is for action, not content. 

How do places like Facebook make websites? I want to learn the best way. Please don't comment about frameworks. I'm fairly new so I want to learn solid foundations."

I'm a broke college student that works at a movie theater, so I have tried to abuse the free-movie perk as much as I could. I'm slated to hit 100 movies as long as I can squeeze in Concussion, Joy, Daddy's Home and (*gulp*) Alvin and the Chipmunks in the next week.


If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! Also, would anyone be interested in seeing the entire list of movies (some I saw more than once) and possibly some compiled stats based on time, day of the week, and 2D/3D/IMAX? I'd be happy to provide that, and maybe some proof. Would a picture of my stack of stubs suffice?


And out of curiosity, how many movies have you seen in theaters in a single calendar year?

**reel**

[pondering](http://logamp.com/1402/music/tracks/5194) is an orchestral track I wrote which reflects some of the dramatic documentary music I've been obsessed with the past few months. Although geared more towards film, this track shows my technique in orchestration and composition. 

[woods](http://logamp.com/1402/music/tracks/5193) is my kokiri forest inspired track. I heard that some of my tracks sound like Zelda, so why not make a Zelda inspired track?

[to the old witch's hut](http://logamp.com/1402/music/tracks/5192) is another cinematic styled orchestral track. I forget what the exact inspiration for this track is, but it reminds me of trekking through a forest. 

[title theme](http://logamp.com/1402/music/tracks/5190) is a piano piece I composed to imitate a jrpg title screen. It's a nice simple song and I love writing these kinds of melodies. This style can be translated to 8-bit pretty easily for that nostalgic retro soundtrack.  

[polar bear vacation](http://logamp.com/1402/music/tracks/5270) is a fun, laid back electronic track with lots of samples and synths.

 Summary: This is a thread about how i started opening girls by winning over my negative beliefs. I wrote it as evidence, that people can overcome their negative beliefs.

Body: Since it is my first post i will write a bit about myself, main post will follow in the next paragraph so feel free to skip this one. I am 26 yo, I finished my universities studies a couple years ago , got a shitty job at H&amp;M folding clothes quited after
2 months. After that i decided to play poker for a living. I was already playing poker casualy and thought maybe i would take it to the next level. In the past i used to run underground games
, boy the money was good and really easy. Been playing for 2 years now, i also have decided to pursue an MBA in finance this September and study for the actuarial exam P in order to become an actuary.
 Used to be an incel in highschool medium grades training all day , i was into sports, but not many friends. Also i struggled with a porn and masturbation habit. At some point i decided to stop that
and beat what i had thought at that time was approach anxiety. I took the decision seriously , i am on my way of beating my beliefs even though i haven't beat all of them.Been reading here for some time but still i have a lot of work to do.
 Now to the main post.
 
 I was out in the night a couple days ago. We were 3 friends, a good friend of mine and his friend. We were at a club, at that club everyone knows us the barmen, the bouncers etc. we get free 
drinks and stuff. I was there with the intention of having fun and if i like something maybe open it up. I was drinking my second round of vodka having fun and and the same time because night clubs are a place where my negative thoughts go on overdrive i was also 
writing down the negatice pop ups that came out in order to work with them.
After a while i noticed two girls that just came next two us.I really liked one of them. I wanted to talk to her but something stoped me from it. At some point my friend something told to them, it 
was really efortless from his side ( both friends are Alpha by the way). I told myself, "" if am not gonna open them i will beat the shit out of me when i go back home, i am tired of that situation""
 A couple seconds pass. And i open both of them
 Me: ""We haven't met. What are your names?""
Them: "" I am x , i am y. ""
Me "" nice to know you ""
-I don't remember how exactly it went after that, the main thing to remember is that over the next couple of hours i talked to them both but, not too much while also having fun with my friends,
 and a some points i focused on the girl i liked.-
 Me -to the girl i like- : Where are you from?
Her: I am from that place and now i am studying here while i also do my internship in the mornings""
Me to the other friend: "" How do you know each other?""
Her: She proceeds to tell me.

 Then i stop talking to them ,and just having fun dancing and drinking with my friends.
At some point i start too feel that i have drunk too much and need some fresh air i go out, and come back after 5 minutes or so. Then after some time. I talk to the girl i like. She was just sitting alone, relaxing or something.
Me: ""You look bored""
Her: ""I am not bored i am just tired i have been working all day""
Me: ""Ok ""

Now after some time the music stops the place was closing. The other friend had already left with two women. And my friend tells me ""hey, let's go"". I reply ok. Then i proceed getting my phone out
and saying to the girl ""Give me your phone number so we can talk some other time"" 
Note:Before i even asked for the number she took the phone from my hands and started writing the number.
I say goodbye to her and her friend. Talk a bit to the barwoman and proceed to go.

That's it more or less.
 Overall i think the interaction was a bit chopy, i need more practice i guess. But still it was a big step for me. The think is that i was talking to them every 10 minutes or so. I don't know, any insights?

 Now i am planning on the date, the venues we will go,the logistics and stuff, i have some stress. Been reading on Ask Trp about first dates and escalating. Any tips about that?

 About the negative beliefs,i read a couple of books about them, what i do now, i really take notice of what i say to myself,what comes to mind in situations that bring out negative beliefs and reading everything i can on that matter.

...develop more quickly to fill in and improve the basics? Why can I still not rename multiple files together? Why is the photo viewer still total crap and can't be replaced as the default app by something else?

...tell us transparently so we have faith in the future of the OS what the hell is going on with the crOS touch UI, the cancelled crOS touch Pixel C, the oddly crappy (as in ""Jeez, I don't know. Maybe put some of those summer interns on the UI?"") snail's-pace Material redesign of crOS, and the Android-crOS merger/non-merger (aka, what the hell is that gonna be, or does no one even have a clue what will work yet?)

...what percentage of google employees use crOS as their main OS?

...design the menu with reference to quick accessibility rather than ""ancient"" Windows menus. For example, why 2 clicks to turn on bluetooth, etc? Why not on the first click? Why not directly on the shelf so zero clicks to get there? Why a tiny vertical Windows-like menu, not a large block with the settings I need, just like a full-screen system menu on Android. And let me modify it to add whatever I need there from almost anywhere in the system?

...have widgets for the desktop? A huge desktop and all I can put on it is ... nothing whatsoever??

...filters everywhere, like the one in Settings, especially when bookmarking or anywhere we have to choose a folder?

...work more closely with the Drive team and others so basic functions are consistent? Basically, why doesn't Google kick some butt in the Drive dep't so we no longer have to deal with Drive NOT having the endlessly convenient ctrl-enter to rename files? or NOT using the same search terms as Gmail? or NOT having a clue about column sorting? (""You mean sort by only 1-2 random columns, so it's different every view but almost always useless? Great idea, let's go with that! Larry hates sorting, I heard."") Etc."

Fan encounter: Ordinary accidental fan encounter, I come to your hotel room asking for an autograph, or maybe we bump into each other at the gym showers? There's always winning a dinner date/weekend vacation with you! ;)

Intern: Wrong place, wrong time; I'm an intern on set or a talk show who accidentally (or deliberately) walks in on you changing or showering! I don't like jumping straight into the sex part, so this would just be a starting point for our scene!

3y3aj6,2,2015-12-24,I [22M] flew to crush's country only to be shrugged off,BirdSetFree,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3y3aj6/i_22m_flew_to_crushs_country_only_to_be_shrugged/,"Reddit i need help. I'm feel like i'm about to go insane.

I'll try to provide some background and give you guys an in-depth view of how things went, and maybe you can see whether i took a bad turn or i should've seen it coming

I've met her about 9 months ago while i was on a project in her country, back then i was in a relationship with someone else so i didn't really feel for her or anything. Fast forrward couple months and we start talking more and more. The more i talked to her the more i was realising thats how i've always imagined my SO would be.

Now, i have been in quite some relationships but i've never felt so.. connected with someone on so many topics and aspects of life. Shes this kind and caring, nerdy type of girl, really good at both listening and communicating. As far as i know she had a long relationship but broke up a year or two ago.


We start speaking more and more, and i'm able to flirt with her responding positively. She keeps telling me on how i should come see her and even tho i'm trying to keep cool, its all i'm thinking about. One night being a bit tipsy texts me on how much she talks to her friends about me and wants to see me. You can see where this is going.


Even tho i wanted so freaking bad to go see her and i was so falling for her, i always felt a bit scared of commiting.


Fun part starts here, two weeks ago i get an offer for an internship from her country and the same city as well. And that was it, i quit my job, canceled my xmas plans and booked a flight.I was all in. Nervous as heck but there i was, going for it. Now i've never commited so hard in my life to just one single thing. But i was happy.


**Now is where the downhill begins.**


The first week i had to attend some meetings and formal stuff so i could in no way meet up with her. On saturday i get to leave from a party early, already had some beers on board and i was feeling just great. I ask her to have a few drinks, she's responding super positively, gives me her address and there i go in a cab to her place.


Apparently she thought i was joking about the whole thing and didn't expect me one moment to actually come. She thought i was joking about the whole coming to her country as well. Things get a little awkward..but ok.. we head off to a shop grab some beer. We get home and start talking for quıte a few hours about random things. Now i know when something goes bad.. And that night it wasn't the case. In fact for some reason i was somehow expecting her to say something. But nothin happened.


Anyways few days later i'm texting her and she just shruggs me off, saying shes all busy. (shes in exam period; i graduated)
Reddit, did i somehow fucked this up? Did i flew in with way too high expectations on how things would go? Was she just a tease?


TL;DR: Flew to another country to meet crush; ended up being shrugged off. How should i react?

Well, as fast as a girl can crawl with the ankles and wrists chained up. And of course, she hadn't heard the name 'Arianna' in some time now. She tended to go by Hucow 0021 for the most part.  
  
""Of course, Hucow 0021 was a rather special for us to acquire here,"" Olivia informed Emily, the new intern. ""She was handpicked up our CEO, Scarlett Williams as a personal Hucow. She worked unknowingly with us under the guise of a Secretary whilst we secretly fed her a concoction of lactation-inducing foods. One day, she complained of milk dampening her blouse, we hooked her up to the milkers, assuring her that the procedure would not take long. And that is when we chained her gagged her, and well; you can see the rest"" Olivia beamed as Emily kneeled down to stroke the blushing Arianna / Hucow 0021. Arianna of course remembered the day vividly, however many months ago it was. She would have uttered a complaint, if she were not ballgagged.  
  
The days since working in The Facility blurred into one, however. ""She is usually strapped to the metal apparatus we found her in. A tube in her mouth to feed, a tube at her nipples to milk, and a tube up her bottom to... Urm... Cleanse, enemas, that part isn't quite my speciality."" Olivia trailed off as Emily nodded.  
  
Arianna's blush deepened in shade. The enemas were the worst part of the day, of course.  
  
""And because this little Hucow is just so beautiful, some of the girls come in to her own room during their breaks to play with her; plait her hair, give her a spank, train her how to moo, whatever they see fit! Oh, as long as Mistress Williams approves. Arianna... I mean, Hucow 0021 is her personal cow, after all.""  
  
""So what about the other hucows? Were they all tricked here?"" Emily asked inquisitively.  
  
""Of course they were, silly!"" Olivia admonished back. ""Why do you think we keep them gagged? We offer ripe girls jobs as secretaries, administration, whatever anonymous jobs. After some weeks of controlled feeding, we deem them necessary to Hucowify... And yes; that is a verb."" Emily laughed in response.  
  
""And if they misbehave?""  
  
""Oh, you needn't worry. There is not period they are not tightly bound. But there are some punishments; caning, electrocuting, public humiliation, whatever incentivises them to keep producing. We keep our girls healthy for longevity, so you will notice their breasts do not grow beyond a D-cup at the absolute limit.""  
  
Emily scribbled note in her handbook.  
  
""But what about the boys you capture?"" Emily asked as they approached a double doorway at the end of the corridor. The hair's on Arianna's body stood up as she trailed behind on her leash and collar.  
  
""Watch and learn"" Olivia grinned as she opened the doors to reveal a warehouse with 50 men, all bound to chairs, with identical tubes running through their gags, and into their bottoms for waste.  
  
""We can be a little rough, farming semen,"" Olivia explained. ""Mistress Maisenbacher, our German farm expert specialises on discipline on both Boys and Hucows, but she finds a natural concoction of vitamins appropriate for Cows, and viagra and no visual-stimulus for boys a necessary procedure"".  
  
Upon closer inspection, Emily gasped as she noticed the intense expression of anguish on the Men's faces as they were milked, tubes stimulating and sucking the semen straight from their raging cocks. It was collected through transparent pipework to a tank in the ceiling.  
  
""Marvellous, isn't it?"" Olivia smiled to herself. ""So, where do you fit into all this, Emily?""

Redskins' OT **Brandon Scherff** and DE **Jackson Jeffcoat** (IR) will be celebrating their 24th birthday during the game on December 26th.|
If the Redskins win it would be the third consecutive game they won. It would be the first time they have done it since winning four straight against Philadelphia across the 1985-87 seasons.|

Eagles|
:---|
The Eagles are the only team in the NFC East to beat a team with a winning record all season; and they did it twice (Jets and Patriots). Washington's seven wins all came against teams with a record .500, or worse; same for the Giants' six wins and the Cowboys' four wins.|
DE **Fletcher Cox** has been a force to be reckoned with on the interior in 2015, notching a career-high 7.5 sacks and 29 quarterback hurries while regularly seeing extra attention from opposing offensive lines. Cox has tallied 12 QB pressures over the last three games, including a season-high eight hurries against New England.|
With 29 hurries through Week 15, DE **Fletcher Cox** has recorded the most quarterback pressures by an Eagles defender since 2012|
WR **Jordan Matthews** established a career high with 159 receiving yards against the Cardinals in Week 15. With 139 career receptions for 1,711 yards and 13 touchdowns in his career, Matthews ranks second in receptions, third in receiving yards and fourth in receiving touchdowns by an Eagle in his first two seasons.|
WR **Jordan Matthews** has recorded the 18th-most receptions in NFL history in his first two seasons in the league and trails only TE **Keith Jackson** (144 catches) among players in Eagles history.|
RBs **Darren Sproles** (45) and **DeMarco Murray** (41) are two of only 12 backs in the NFL with at least 40 receptions. The two are also the only pair of running back teammates to have recorded 40-plus catches.|
With an 83-yard punt return touchdown in the third quarter at New England, RB **Darren Sproles** tied **DeSean Jackson** for the Eagles career punt return touchdown record with four. Sproles became the only player in team history to record two-or-more punt return scores in multiple seasons, having accomplished the feat in 2014 and 2015.|
RB **Darren Sproles** is currently in sole possession of 11th place in NFL history in career all-purpose yards (17,794) after passing Hall of Fame RB **Marcus Allen** (17,648) in Week 13.|
With seven career punt return touchdowns, RB **Darren Sproles** is tied for sixth in NFL history with RB **David Meggett**. His nine career kick and punt return touchdowns are also tied for sixth in the league with WR **Jacoby Jones**, as well as Hall of Famers RB **Ollie Matson** and DB **Deion Sanders**|
Over his last five starts, QB **Sam Bradford** has completed 108-of-164 passes for 1,259 yards and seven touchdowns to only three interceptions, resulting in a 95.6 passer rating.|
S **Ed Reynolds** recorded his first-career interception in the waning minutes of a Week 14 win over the Bills, making him the ninth different Eagles defender to pick off a pass in 2015. The team’s nine individual interceptors is the third-most in the NFL, trailing only the Falcons (10) and Steelers (11).|
The **Eagles Defense** are currently tied for sixth in the NFL with 15 interceptions on the season and tied for seventh in the league with 25 total takeaways.|
The **Eagles Offense** are one of only three teams in the league to feature two tight ends with at least 300 yards receiving and two scores, joining the San Diego Chargers (**Antonio Gates** and **Ladarius Green**) and the Chicago Bears (**Martellus Bennett** and **Zach Miller**). TE **Brent Celek** has totaled 24 catches for 342 yards, while TE **Zach Ertz** ranks second on the team in receiving yards (579) and catches (53). Ertz is also tied for ninth among tight ends in the league in receptions.|
Eagles Great LB **Marcus Smith**, 2014 first-round pick, had a half-sack against the Cardinals for his first QB takedown!|


Redskins|
:---|
Opposing quarterbacks have put up a 96.2 cumulative quarterback rating against the Redskins' secondary this season, including a 122.6 by QB **Sam Bradford** the first time the two teams met this season.|
Last week, QB **Kirk Cousins** completed 22 passes - including four touchdowns - for 319 yards in the Redskins' 35-25 victory over the Bills. In doing so, Cousins (336) broke the Redskins' single-season completion record which was previously held by QB **Jason Campbell** (327) and set in the 2009 season.|
If only Washington had more home games - QB **Kirk Cousins** led the Redskins to a 6-2 record at FedExField this season, and his passing numbers at home (2170 yards, 16 TDs, 2 INTs, 117.0 rating) are much better than his road numbers (1455 yards, 6 TDs, 9 INTs, 74.6 rating). Cousins now owns the franchise single-season records for most passing yards at home, surpassing QB **Jay Schroeder**, who passed for 2111 yards at home in 1986. Cousins's completion percentage at home (74.7 percent) is the highest single-season mark in home games in NFL history by a player who threw at least 75 passes at home.|
QB **Kirk Cousins** currently leads the NFL witha 69.7 completion percentage.|
WR **DeSean Jackson** makes his second visit to Philadelphia since signing with Washington after the Eagles cut him before last season.  Jackson has nine catches for 243 yards and one TD in two games against the Eagles. He was injured and did not play against the team earlier in the 2015 season.|

Milestones|
:---:|
TE **Brent Celek** (368) needs four catches to pass **Keith Byars** (371) for fifth place and six receptions to pass **Pete Pihos** (373) for fourth in Eagles history.|
TE **Brent Celek** (4,657) can move into 8th place on the Eagles all-time recieving list with 115 more yards.  He would pass WR **Ben Hawkins** (4,764) and WR **Jeremy Maclin** (4,771).|
RB **Darren Sproles** (17,794) needs 206 more all-purpose yards to reach 18,000 career all-purpose yards.  Additionally, Sproles is 375 all-purpose yards away from moving into the NFL's top 10 all time list.|
WR **Pierre Garcon** (5,898) needs 102 more yards to reach 6,000 career receiving yards.|
WR **DeSean Jackson** (49) needs 1 touchdown to reach 50 career touchdowns.|
LB **Ryan Kerrigan** (46.5) needs 3.5 sacks to reach 50 career sacks.|
QB **Kirk Cousins** (40)  needs 1 more touchdown to take sole possession of 10th place on the Redskins all-time touchdown list. He currently shares 10th place with QB **Robert Griffin**.| 
RB **Alfred Morris** (1042) needs 2 rushing attempts to pass RB **Terry Allen** (1043) to take 5th place on the Redskins all-time rushing attempts list.|
WR **Jamison Crowder** (52) needs 2 receptions to pass **Charley Taylor** (53 in 1964) for third-most receptions by a rookie in Redskins history.|
The Redskins could win their 600th game in team history, including postseason play. Washington would be the fifth NFL franchise to reach the 600-win mark.  They would joint the Bears, Packers, Giants and Steelers.|

Matchups to Watch|
:---:|
**Redskins WR DeSean Jackson vs. Eagles secondary**|
The Eagles are going to have to double team Jackson all game. He'll probably see a lot of rookie cornerback Eric Rowe, with help over the top from either Malcolm Jenkins or Walter Thurmond. The way to handle the mercurial Jackson is to get a jam on him at the line, play physical with him and basically just knock him off his routes. It's a tough test for the rookie.|
**Redskins LB Ryan Kerrigan vs. Eagles LT Jason Peters:**|
Kerrigan, with eight-and-a-half sacks, leads the Redskins in that category and is the key to the team's pass rush. Coordinator Joe Barry will move Kerrigan from side to side and he'll stand up and put his hand on the ground. More times than not he'll line up over Peters and the left tackle will have to show he's worthy of the Pro Bowl berth he received earlier this week.|
**Redskins OL vs. Eagles blitz**|
The Redskins have kept Cousins clean most of the year, allowing just 24 sacks, the sixth lowest total in the league. In a loss to Dallas three weeks ago the Cowboys blitzed like crazy and caused some trouble for Cousins. The Eagles need to copy the plan and get after him the same way. This is going to be a game of wits on both sides and the Eagles coaching staff better be on top of their game.|

3y47e7,5,2015-12-24,"Question about a short, personal letter with resume.",Uhfolks,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/3y47e7/question_about_a_short_personal_letter_with_resume/,"Edit: Thanks for the responses so far!! I'm planning on taking out any mention of my girlfriend &amp; adding in more about a few specific reasons I think I would be a great fit.

**~If you want to skip the background information, my question is at the bottom of the post**

I'm going into my last semester of my Senior year, which means job hunting is in full swing for me. I've attended this semester's career fair &amp; landed multiple interviews. But none of these places are where I necessarily ""want"" to be. Multiple reasons: location, the job itself, etc...

Long story short, my girlfriend of 3 years lives in a small town I'll simply call ""Town"" for sake of privacy. She already has a great job she loves there, plus a majority of her family lives there. Obviously, she wants to remain in Town for these reasons, but is willing to move if I absolutely can't get a job nearby.

I'd love to live in Town, but it has a small problem. There is only one plant that employs Chemical Engineers &amp; it is not somewhere I'd want to work. The main reason is that they've had multiple *major* safety incidents in the past few years that have resulted in deaths.... so I'd rather not end up there.

But good news! A new plant from a very well respected company is opening soon &amp; is actively seeking engineers. Not only that, but the job description is almost down to the letter what I've done in all 4 of my internships. They have 17 bullet points of ""Job Functions"" &amp; I've extensively done all but one of those in my previous positions.

Essentially, I sincerely believe I'd be a perfect fit. Not only because it's exactly where I want to be, so there aren't any worries of me moving off in a year or two like a lot of young engineers seem to. But also because I feel very confident the projects I've already worked on &amp; excelled in line up perfectly with what they're looking for.

Now for the problems... The Job description asks for 1-3 years of industrial experience. I've always heard to apply for these types of jobs even if you don't have the length of experience they're looking for, but it still worries me that I only have 4 summers of experience (So *technically* a year, but not what I’d truly consider a year of experience). Also, my GPA is definitely not the highest. It's sitting at a 2.82 currently. As many hours as I have under my belt by this point I don't expect that to change by more than .1 up or down in a semester's time. I had a really rough start, but my grades have steadily increased since then &amp; I can furnish the individual semester grades to back that up.

~`~

Now, finally, my actual question.

Would it be considered unprofessional or ill-advised to include a short ""cover letter"" of sorts with my resume? Something to the effect of:

""My name is X and while I'll let my resume communicate my specific qualifications and experience, I wanted to include a personal letter as to why I sincerely want to work for {their company name}.

My girlfriend of over 3 years is employed locally and loves Town, as well as her job. I've been searching for opportunities in the area and your soon to be opened plant is essentially an answered prayer. Not only is the location exactly where I want to spend the rest of my life, the job description is an almost identical match to the experience I've gained in 4 summers working for {Company} as an intern.

If nothing else, I'd ask you to please consider bringing me in for an interview. I realize a few short paragraphs and a resume are not enough to convey how great of a match that not only I would be for the company, but the company would be for me. I apologize if this letter is slightly unusual, but of all the companies I've interviewed with or looked into leading up to graduation, yours is the first I've truly felt I would be a perfect fit in.

Sincerely,

Uhfolks""

I wanted to keep it as short as possible, because I know an inordinately long letter would have the chance of either not getting read, or even hurting my chances."

As the sun slowly starts to peek up over the treetops of Route 5, Elliot Fleet finally wraps up his marathon training session. Inspired by the Sleep Powder incident in the Power Plant, he has spent the night practicing a series of rudimentary hand signals with his Pokémon in case non-verbal communication is ever necessary again. Now, each of his four Pokémon can consistently and accurately respond to four hand signals apiece, one for each of their moves. It was hard work drilling, but the team is coming along and learning them quick. Elliot lifts his hands to get his team's attention.

*Okay, guys, that's good. Wow, I can't believe we spent the whole night out here. Huddle up, team meeting! Okay, so. A few things. First, we're gonna challenge Clemont today. I know you're all exhausted, and I am too, so we'll all get a good rest at the Center, then have a couple of hours before meeting Shauna at 5 and heading over. A little weird schedule, I know, but that's how it worked out. Any objections?*

The team shakes their heads, tired and ready to rest, but still as excited as their trainer to visit the Gym in Prism Tower.

*Next item of business...something I've kind of been dreading. After all the excitement in Coumarine City with Serena and Mr. Ramos, and then the whole thing at the Power Plant, I got distracted from doing something I said I would do. It really pains me, but I want to be true to my word. Bluebeard, I'll ask the Nurse today about the possibility of sending you to a nice Lapras Conservation, where they'll know just how to take care of you and you'll be able to be with your own kind. It's been a real joy getting to know you, but I figured you'd rather be where you belong.*

Hearing this, the sensitive Bluebeard shakes his head vigorously. Elliot looks at him tenderly as he puts his two front flippers on Molly's and Salt's feet, the Pokémon on either side of him. His eyes welling up with tears, Bluebeard keens earnestly. Seeing Molly reach out and put her arm around the Lapras' neck while Salt shakes his head and Toshi looks heartbroken, Elliot relents, feeling filled with relief.

*Alright! You want to stay with us fulltime, Bluebeard? I'm thrilled! I just wanted to make sure.*

He steps forward and hugs Bluebeard around the neck. Overcome with joy, the Lapras hops up and plants his front flippers on Elliot's chest, pushing him over and landing on top on him. He begins covering Elliot's face with Lapras kisses.

*Haha, alright, alright! Get off me, you crazy boy! I'm so glad you decided to stay.*

Still laughing, Elliot stands up and returns his companions to their Pokéballs. Backtracking to the Pokémon Center, he heals them up, then rents a room in the back and falls into bed. He is asleep before his head hits the pillow.

*

What seems like a moment later, he wakes up and looks at the alarm clock on the bedside table. It's 3:30 in the afternoon. Just enough time to wake back up and meet Shauna. After splashing cold water on his face, he heads outside and takes a walk through the streets of Lumiose to work the last of the sleep out of his system. Before he knows it, it's time to head back. In the Center lobby, he is greeted by his ebullient friend. Together, they set off to Prism Tower. They arrive in the lobby, which is pristine and uniformly white from the floor to the ceiling. On the floor is an upright sign reading ""Next Exam in 30 Minutes."" Baffled by the sign, Elliot approaches the receptionist and asks for the chance to challenge Clemont. The smiling receptionist hands him a clipboard and points to the sign. Elliot brings the clipboard to a nearby chair and sits down next to Shauna.

*What the heck is this about?*

**Oh, I forgot to tell you! Clemmy likes to test his challengers' brains before battling them, so everyone needs to sit for a little quiz on the basics of Pokémon training before heading in. Whoever scores the highest gets to battle Clemmy! The Lumiose City Gym gets the most challenges, as you can imagine, so Clemmy needs some sort of screening process, otherwise he'd be battling 24/7! Pretty fancy, huh?**

*Dang, he really doesn't mess around. A quiz huh? We'll see...*

Elliot fills out the form and submits it to the receptionist. Gradually, the Gym fills up with prospective challengers, eagerly poring over study sheets and schoolbooks. Seeing his intense competition, Elliot gulps. Just then, the receptionist stands up and announces the list of names for the next round of testing. As everyone stands and gathers in front of her desk, the elevator dings again, and Clemont's sister Bonnie marches out, flanked by her Dedenne. Both of them are wielding stout wooden rulers. In her distinctive, little-kid voice, Bonnie pipes up.

&gt; Alright, look alive, challengers! Come with me for testing!

With a comically exaggerated stern expression on her face, she herds the group of challengers, including Elliot into the elevator and, standing on tiptoe, pokes a button with her ruler. The last thing Elliot sees before the doors slide closed is Shauna waving at him and giving him a playful wink.

*(Oh man, what have I gotten myself into?)*

The elevator opens, and the challengers find themselves in a sloping lecture hall. Bonnie shoves her way to the front of the group and begins barking out instructions.

&gt; Welcome to the Amp-itheater! Take your seats, leave spaces in between, and await further instructions!

Once everyone is seated, she passes out a thick test packet to each person, then she and her Dedenne being prowling up and down the aisles, proctoring the exam.

&gt; BEGIN!

Amidst a flurry of others doing the same, Elliot flips open his test and stares at the first question.

*Oh, good...multiple choice. Let's see. ""What is the attack multiplier afforded by STAB?"" What the hell? What is STAB? Damn, I'm in way over my head...*

Elliot slogs through the test filled with technical questions and nitty-gritty aspects of training he's never considered. Heck, he just drills moves with his Pokémon until they seem satisfied, strong and confident. Is there really more to training than that? Elliot's mind is boggled by how much he does not know. Before he knows it, Bonnie is collecting test papers. She brings them to a walled-off side office in the corner of the lecture hall and shuts the door, leaving the trainers to chatter and speculate nervously. Presently, Bonnie emerges from the office looking somewhat flustered.

&gt; Challenger Elliot Fleet, come with me!

Stunned, Elliot rises and follows the petite drill-sergeant-in-the-making back into the elevator. She presses another button, and they begin whizzing upwards.

&gt; Congratulations, Mr. Fleet. You have been selected to battle my brother Clemont. He's super duper strong, so you'll need a lot of luck to beat him! And don't you forget it! 

Overcome with belligerent love for her sibling, Bonnie jabs Elliot lightly in the belly with her ruler to punctuate each word. Simultaneously smirking and wincing, Elliot resists the urge to tousle her hair, figuring she would not take kindly to such a patronizing gesture. He doesn't want to know what that ruler feels like across his face. Finally, the elevator opens once more, and Elliot faces a bizarre site: a room as white as the lobby with the notable exception of a checkered tile-patterned boxing ring. The square tiles change color every second or two, creating a dazzling if disorienting display. Standing on the opposite side of the ring is Clemont.

* Oh, Elli! Shauna's friend. You're Elliot Fleet?! Wow! I just got a call from Ramos of Coumarine City to follow up on the blackout, and he said you helped him kick some Team Flare goons out and restore order. That's really something! I owe you big time, so I figured I'd override the test results and let you up immediately. Still, I had to see the test through as a formality. Don't wanna ruffle any feathers, ya know? Okay, so. You ready to go? I conduct my Gym battles in 3-on-3 format. We go until a trainer has no Pokémon remaining. One healing item per trainer. Is this agreeable?

*Sounds good to me.*

* Excellent. Before we begin, I received one request from a prospective visitor. Do you consent to our match being spectated?

*Must have been Shauna. Of course she can come!*

Clemont nods to Bonnie, who reaches into her purse and pulls out a walkie talkie and speaks into it. After a moment, Shauna appears and takes a seat in the bleachers on either side of the ring. She waves to both battlers and blows them kisses, unable to pick one to root for.

* Begin! For my first Pokémon, I select Baron!

*Molly, you're up!*

Elliot's Exploud faces off against Clemont's Emolga, both ready for action. 

*Start with Rock Tomb, Molly!*

* Baron, evade and counter with Quick Attack!

The Emolga darts forward and nimbly navigates through Molly's flurry of debris, scoring a direct hit. Still, its tiny body is too light to inflict much damage. At their trainers' commands, the Pokémon repeat the same moves. This time, Rock Tomb hits, but Baron manages to hang on by a thread. Elliot attempts a third Rock Tomb for the knockout, but Clemont foresees the attack. 

* Baron, Volt Switch!

The Emolga sends out a crackle of electricity and retreats to his ball, immediately being replaced by a tough metal Magneton. The Rock Tomb glances off its hard body, barely leaving a dent.

* You can't be such a one-trick pony, Elliot! Strategy matters in my Gym! Jumpstart, Electric Terrain!

The Magneton tilts over and presses its six magnets to the ground, charging the floor of the ring with a lively current. 

*Molly, time to start buckling down. Power-Up Punch!*

Molly charges forward and launches a punch at the Magneton. Not used to delivering physical attacks, Molly wrings her hand in pain, but the callous has already begun to form. As Jumpstart delivers a Thunderbolt, Molly rushes forward and delivers another Power-Up Punch. This one hurts Jumpstart more and Molly less. Gritting his teeth, Clemont extends his robo-arm to spray a Hyper Potion over his Magneton. Elliot grins, remembering Korrina's words from a long while back. ""It's not wise to stall and let Power-Up Punch build up.""

*Molly, it's time for Bulldoze!*
 
Molly brings her toughened fists crashing to the floor, creating a ripple in the ground that causes the Magneton to spasm violently. To Elliot's shock, however, it rises back up, just barely holding on.

* My Magenton sure is Sturdy, huh? Thunderbolt, Jumpstart!

Lighting bolts arc out from Jumpstart's magnets and juice Molly thoroughly, dropping her to one knee. Not wanting to take any risks, Elliot darts forward and administers his one and only Super Potion, enabling his Exploud to stand back up. To psych herself back up, Molly takes a huge breath and forces it out the holes in her back, legs, and tail, generating the sound of a pipe organ keyboard being pounded on.

*It's on its last legs, Molly. That's a free Power-Up Punch for us!*

Molly crashes her now-rock-hard fist into the Magneton, and it spins backward, collapsing at its trainer's feet. At full health and with massive attack power, Molly has no trouble dispatching Clemont's remaining fighters, Emolga and Heliolisk. Clemont returns his last Pokémon and looks ruefully at Elliot.

* Good work, Elli! You really are as tough as I've heard. You earned this badge. And this TM, too! I love this one - it's my favorite gadget. And that's saying something! Now -

&gt; Challenger!! You have defeated my big brother Clemont of Lumiose City! However, your test grades were abysmal! Consider hiring a tutor - mmph!

Clemont's robo-arm scoops up the rambunctious, interrupting Bonnie and covers her mouth as the Gym leader blushes self-consciously. 

* Bonnie, please! Try to be polite. Sorry about her, Elliot. It was a good match. I should have known better than to let you get away with so many boosting moves. You made an excellent physical attacker out of a Pokémon renowned for its special-attacking prowess and took me totally off-guard. You see, we all still have lots to learn!

*Thanks, Clemont. That means a lot. I'll see you around!*

Elliot, Molly, and Shauna make their way down to the lobby and back outside, where they can see the sun setting. 

**Good work, Elli! So, where to next?**

*Well, I checked out that Gym leader database you mentioned yesterday, and it looks like my next destination is Laverre City. You wouldn't wanna come with me, would you?*

**Oh, Elli, that sounds like to much fun! But...I applied for an internship at the Trainer PR Video studio, and I just got accepted today! So it looks like I'll be living in Lumiose for the time being, filming videos of serious competitive trainers and their Pokémon. Best of luck, though! I mean it!**

She gives him a final squeeze, then heads off through the labyrinthine streets of Lumiose. Elliot is happy for Shauna. She had seemed rather directionless early on in their journey, so he is glad to see her finding something to be excited about. Still, he finds himself surprised at how disappointed he feels that she can't join him on the next leg of his journey. He shakes his head to clear it and looks down at his Exploud.

*Molly, you were a total rock star today. You get to pick where we got for dinner tonight. Lead the way.*

---------------------------------------------

This Gym ended up being no sweat, thankfully, since like I mentioned last time I am insanely overleveled. I'm gonna try to dial it back moving forward, reducing grinding and avoiding trainer battles when I can to get back on fair ground.

I'm really glad Molly had a chance to shine today. Ever since the team filled out, it's been tough to give each member equal spotlight, so Molly really deserved the chance to get some love. Very proud of her today.

And it's not helping.  None of it is helping.  The SGI teaches that the magic chant/scroll/Mystic Law enables devotees to overcome *anything*, including all sorts of illnesses, and that the Lotus Sutra is akin to ""a great physician who changes poison into medicine"".  Well, it ain't workin' O_O

Have a look (these may be in latest-to-earliest order - I dunno):

**Never Give Up: Buddhism, Family &amp; Schizophrenia**

&gt;**I am still waiting for the evil people to be taken away, for the indictments to be handed down, and for all of them to finally be hauled off to where ever they are going. Hopefully somewhere far away from me. They’re exhausting, and hearing their constant babbling everywhere I go is disgusting. The fact that they are all still here is also sickening.** I believe that the level of corruption, in addition to the unbelievable incompetence on the part of both the U.S. government and the state/county/local governments involved is absolutely unforgivable. How sad. Unfortunately, both the U.S. and the California state governments are pervaded with sheer cowardice and rampant corruption. It’s almost as if the authorities involved don’t want this to be taken care of. How bizarre.

#1 - if it seems bizarre, it just might be O_O

If there's nothing there, there's nothing the authorities can do.

&gt;I am perfectly willing to make myself available for interviews (radio, television, or other), although as of this writing no one has contacted me. Please feel free to contact me at ^^^^^@^^^^^ or my cell (xxx) xxx-xxxx. I don’t have a landline or any other telephone number that I can be reached at. Perhaps my own publicity efforts would help speed this matter along?

#2 - we always counsel people to vigilantly guard their privacy and never disclose personal information, here or anywhere online.

&gt;The Great Battle

&gt;The Write To Market conference last month in Corte Madera was interesting. It was run by Xxxx Xxxxxx and a man who sounded remarkably like Nicholas Cage. The man-who-sounded-like-Nicholas Cage suggested a new title for my memoir, “**The Telepathic Buddhist.**” I think this is original and upbeat – much more snappy than the lengthy “Never Give Up…” I have been using.

&gt;I practiced my two-paragraph pitch and gained new insight into my memoir. I realized more clearly what was (and still is) at stake. **These past fifteen years or so, ever since I started having “mental health”/feelings of persecution problems, my sanity was at stake**, but so was my marriage, and so was my life. Since this is an ongoing problem (i.e. **the people who have targeted me are still here**), my sanity, my marriage and my life are still at stake. This has yet to be resolved – at least at the time of this writing.
Over the years, I wondered how this nightmarish situation looks to other people. What do they perceive as the problem(s), the causes, and/or the solution. I’ve come to believe that every person has a different perspective. Much of the stories floating around simply aren’t true, and it is an extremely difficult situation to explain, especially without all of the information. **Many people (including numerous U.S. government employees) are facing indictments, although I don’t know specifically who or what the charges are. I can only speculate. Bribery, perjury, obstruction of justice, impersonating a federal agent, interfering with a federal investigation, bomb making, and the list goes on. Some people are facing an international trial with the International Court of Justice, one of which, Xxxxx Xxxx, was my former boss for two months in 1999-2000. Others remain here in the U.S. or have been extradited to their home countries to be held accountable.**

#3 - it appears that nothing has actually occurred - this is all her own pathological persecution delusion.

&gt;From a Nichiren Buddhist perspective, part of our practice includes a battle or struggle between the forces of good (the Buddha) and the forces of evil. I believe this constitutes the nature of my experience. As SGI President Daisaku Ikeda states

&gt;*This is a battle between respect and contempt for people. When practitioners of the Lotus Sutra [Nichiren Buddhism] endeavor to propagate its teachings in the real world, great opposition arises, a manifestation of the function of the devil king of the sixth heaven that resides in people’s lives…In Buddhism, “devils” or “devilish functions” are defined as “robbers of life.” In other words, they drain away the life force we need to lead positive lives…Living Buddhism, December 2015 p. 30-33*

It does not help anyone's mental health to be talking about ""devils"" or ""demons"" or ""battles between good and evil"" as if such nonsense actually exists.  We MUST stop this sort of toxic thinking, and the first way is to stop the dangerous charlatans who promulgate it.

&gt;**This makes sense to me, but I have been practicing this Buddhism for over 25 years.** When I thought of how other people might perceive this situation, I did not know quite how I would explain this Buddhist perspective. Obviously, this nightmare did not occur merely to prove the validity of this particular Buddhism, nor did it occur merely to cause people heartache and concern. When I read further, I found a definition of the Devil King of the Sixth Heaven that I had not read before. In Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism, much of the Buddha’s teachings are metaphor, they are not meant to be interpreted literally. What I found was this:

&gt;*Nichiren Daishonin says that the devil king of the sixth heaven attacks the forces of good with his “ten kinds of troops.” The ten kinds of troops are listed in The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom as: (1) greed, (2) discouragement, (3) hunger and thirst, (4) craving, (5) sleepiness, (6) fear, (7) doubt and regret, (8) anger, (9) preoccupation with fame, fortune, and false glory, and (10) arrogance and contempt for others. All of these are devilish functions that arise within us. Living Buddhism, December 2015 p. 30*

This bullshit they're promoting is harming people - see the effects right here.

&gt;In Buddhism, our struggles are almost always an internal battle, but sometimes there are external forces at work that might influence our faith, our judgment, and our happiness. **In my experience, I have had to develop my Buddha nature so that I am not influenced by these “devilish functions” at work in my life, *even though they are external.***

Honey, there's nothing there.  Really.

&gt;There is still the internal part of me that has to be able to deal with their evil in order to survive – to preserve my sanity, my marriage and to protect my own life.

She keeps saying that...circular thinking, mind going round and round, chasing its own tail, consuming itself with itself.

&gt;In August 2011, I created a blog to chronicle my experience dealing the mental illness I was diagnosed with in 2002: schizophrenia. This diagnosis was based on the symptoms I described to psychiatrists: hearing voices, paranoia, and the belief that I was being persecuted by the mafia. **In reality, I never believed that the “voices” I heard were symptoms of schizophrenia. Instead, I believed that a form of communication which has never been scientifically proven – telepathy – was what allowed me to hear the “voices” of my enemies in my head, and which also allowed my enemies to “hear” my thoughts.**

Notice how she knew better than the doctors - this is Severe Mental Illness 101.

&gt;These bizarre set of circumstances, combined with **the demented insanity of everyone involved** created a horrific set of circumstances for myself, my husband and our families. 

Talk about projection!!

&gt;Ultimately, the situation devolved into chaos for the people and surrounding communities who were forced to become involved. I challenge my circumstances and find hope, courage and strength in my Buddhist practice. I turn to my husband and family for love and support. Writing and photography are my creative outlets and emotional therapy. I never give up in my fight. My memoir is a source of hope, inspiration, and encouragement for everyone.

Well, that's ONE way of looking at it, I suppose O_O

I'm repelled and horrified, personally!  But let's continue:

&gt;There is more than one antagonistic force in this memoir. Specifically, the antagonistic force(s) are people. They are **the people who began stalking, harassing and persecuting me in 2002. The people included a former roommate from Oxnard, CA in addition to a man whom I initially believed was associated with the mafia (it turns out he was former CIA). Initially, there were 3-4 people involved, but over the years, the number grew and now this group probably numbers around 40-50 people (although it could be more than this). This number includes the people [government employees/agents] who may not have necessarily been stalking me this entire time but were (and still are) nevertheless involved [by using me as a scapegoat] in an attempt to avoid their own indictment.**

WTF??  Her delusions are clearly becoming more and more grandiose - the mental illness is becoming more severe.

&gt;Primary Conflict (*this is a category of literary analysis of what she's writing*)

&gt;My struggle against the people (devilish functions) in my life who constantly torment, stalk, persecute, and harass me. Initially I believed I had done something wrong and that I somehow was at fault for their behavior. **I eventually realized that [from a Buddhist perspective], this was my karma and I needed to be able to change it. I had certainly never done anything to warrant this type of persecution and harassment directed at me by complete strangers.**

&gt;My inner conflict was coming to my own understanding of why this happened, using my Buddhist practice as a guide.

And boy howdy, is it ever working O_O

&gt;Secondary Conflict:  Trying to understand why no one ever felt comfortable enough to approach me with questions about this situation, or why no one I knew (i.e. friends, family, Buddhist friends, etc…) ever discussed this problem with me.

&gt;I keep wondering when this is going to end. **I still can’t figure out why the person (people) stalking me has not been arrested. I would think that by now, there would be some way of figuring this out. After all, this man (Sam?) has been stalking, harassing and threatening me for the past thirteen years. Yet, he is still out there? Nothing can be done about him? Nothing? Why is this?  Does this make sense to anyone? Does it seem reasonable? No! Absolutely not. He is still accompanied by two or three others.**
 
&gt;On Monday, I had a dentist appointment. **One of the women associated with him made an appointment at approximately the same time as my appointment. She was seated in a dentist chair not far from mine, and although I didn’t hear much of what she said, she appeared to be lying about her reasons for being there at the exact same time I was.**

Dentists do not disclose to people who has appointments when.  This is pure crazy.
 
&gt;On Wednesday, I took my dog Xxxxxx to her vet for a nail trim. **As I walked into the vet’s office, I heard sirens. The people who follow me everywhere are prone to making fake 911 calls (often claiming that I am actually the person making the call).**

Maybe she is O_O

&gt;Xxxxx and I walked into the vet and told the receptionist we were in for a nail trim. **One of the women who stalks me was already there.**

How did she manage that?  Was she reading her thoughts and knew where she'd be going and just scampered there ahead of her?

&gt;She looked to be Asian or South Asian and was talking to one of the tech assistants, claiming that she was some sort of “inspector,” or perhaps that’s what she wanted me to hear. 

Honey, if you've got anything against Asians, you do NOT want to be involved with the SGI!

&gt;Woman: “Well, you let me see everything and you signed the form…” (inaudible conversation)

&gt;Tech: “Yes, well we’re an independent clinic. If someone wakes up in the morning and sees that their pet has a problem, they can come right in…” (more inaudible conversation)

&gt;I waited for Xxxxx, and when her technician brought her back out to me, the Asian woman looked at Xxxxx as if confirming something. Then she left. 

&gt;Assistant to the Tech: “Was that Animal Control?”

&gt;Nope, it wasn’t animal control. Here’s what happened later in the afternoon when I went to the Kohl’s at El Camino Real and Lawrence Expressway: I walked into the store and walked into the fitness department. I stopped to look at their workout shirts and sweatshirts. **I heard a store employee by the cashiers tell someone, “No. Once you’ve gone in through there, you can’t go leave.”** Hmmmm. I think what happened was one of the other women (also Asian or South Asian) had followed me in Kohl’s. Then she ran into one of the dressing rooms and hid. **See, the problem is there is a restraining order on every single one of these people (both the men and the women) prohibiting them from following me into stores (and people’s houses) and requiring them to maintain a certain distance. The issue is they consistently violate the restraining order. Often on a daily basis.**

Yuh huh.  I'll bet there's no restraining order, as she has already defined these individuals as ""strangers"" and she has no idea how many are involved.  I'll bet she imagined the restraining order as well, right along with all the other ""I'm so noble and righteous and innocent and beleaguered"" details.  I'm no expert, but there are often delusions of :

**Schizophrenia is a mental disorder distinguished by a loss of contact with reality and the occurrence of psychotic behaviors, including hallucinations and delusions (unreal beliefs which endure even when there is contrary evidence). Delusions may include the false and constant idea that the person is being followed or poisoned, or that the person’s thoughts are being broadcast for others to listen to. Delusions in schizophrenia often develop as a response to the individual attempting to explain their hallucinations. Patients who experience recurrent auditory hallucinations can develop the delusion that other people are scheming against them and are dishonest when they say they do not hear the voices that the delusioned person believes that he or she hears.** [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandiose_delusions)

**[P]ersecutory delusions are the most common form of delusions in paranoid schizophrenia, where the person believes ""he or she is being tormented, followed, tricked, spied on, or ridiculed.""** [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecutory_delusion)

**Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world. People with schizophrenia often have an altered perception of reality. They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in strange or confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them, or feel like they’re being constantly watched.** [Source](http://www.helpguide.org/articles/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-signs-types-and-causes.htm)

&gt;**I visited my parents in Colorado over Halloween, and all of these people flew to Colorado, although they had absolutely no reason to go there. They only reason they flew to Colorado was because I was visiting my parents. The majority of them were on my flight! Surprise, surprise. They all left when I left. Certainly this is extremely perplexing!** So the fact that this nightmare continues to drag on astonishes me. **I can’t believe that there is nothing that can be done to prevent sh#$@&amp;d (as I call him) and his minions from carrying out this type of behavior on a daily basis. He should have been taken off the streets years ago. This is my firm belief.**
 
&gt;So, while I don’t know what the holdup is, I will continue to “speak out” about this on my blog as long as it continues. I am hoping for the best possible outcome, and of course, for the justice we all deserve. 

&gt;*Addressing young people, SGI President Ikeda affirms that when confronted by cruel reality, if we cannot feel hope, it is time to create some. We can do this by digging deeper within, searching for even a small glimmer of light, for the possibility of a way to begin to break through the impasse before us. – Daisaku Ikeda, October 16, 2015, World Tribune* 

&gt;This is how I often feel before I get out of bed in the morning – “confronted by cruel reality.” Especially when I don’t want to get out of bed and live the day. **I get tired of all the people following me around and all the screaming and yelling.**

The people who don't exist and the screaming and yelling that don't exist.

&gt;I read this story last week sometime and felt encouraged. The article and the idea of “creating hope” gave me the motivation to create a little more hope and happiness in my own life. It didn’t take too much effort, all I did was think of a few things to work on that I enjoy and help me envision a more positive future.

&gt;I decided to revisit the second memoir I started writing last year but hadn’t worked in eight or nine months. My second memoir is about my experience as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic, but it’s still in the very beginning stages. When I started working on it again, I felt better. I discovered how much I remembered from the two years I spent overseas and how much I still have to write. This did involve some effort on my part, however, writing, especially memoir requires me to delve into my memories and as President Ikeda says, “by digging deeper,” I was able to shift my thoughts away from my external environment and back towards my own life. In other words, I was able to distract myself and focus less on my own unhappiness, and more on the positive aspects of my life.

&gt;I also decided to get really creative and wrote a children’s poem in the style of Shel Silverstein. My poem made me laugh and the funny thing is, I “wrote” it while taking a shower. A few hours later, I decided to type it up and save it on the computer before I forgot all the words. I’ve also spent more time working on the XXXX website. I’ve hired an intern to write a weekly blog for XXXX starting in November, and I’m really looking forward to working with her.

I wonder if she really hired someone, or if this is just another one of her delusions talking O_O

&gt;Hope is a decision.

&gt;Life is definitely looking up and **I can’t wait until this is over and these people are gone from my life for good**.

&gt;**I attended a brief Q&amp;A with our new SGI General Director last Friday, and I gave him a copy of my memoir to take back with him to Los Angeles. I told him my determination is to share my experience (based on my memoir) with SGI President Ikeda at the Hall of the Great Vow for World Peace in Tokyo. During the meeting, my mind frequently wandered about the ongoing events over the past 10-15 years or so. Ultimately, what strikes me as the most extraordinary of all is the fact that it actually happened.
What I mean by this is the fact that the schizophrenia diagnosis my psychiatrist gave me in 2002 turned out not to be a mental illness, but a truly terrifying and bizarre reality.** According to the accepted psychiatric definition from the DSM-V, (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association), the following “characteristic symptoms” are listed for schizophrenia:

A. Characteristic symptoms: Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated):

1.	Delusions – false beliefs strongly held in spite of invalidating evidence, especially as a symptom of mental illness: for example,
1.	Paranoid delusions, or delusions of persecution, for example believing that people are “out to get” you, or the thought that people are doing things when there is no external evidence that such things are taking place.
2.	**Delusions of reference – when things in the environment seem to be directly related to you even though they are not. For example, it may seem as if people are talking about you or special personal messages are being communicated to you through the TV, radio, or other media.**
3.	Somatic Delusions are false beliefs about your body – for example that a terrible physical illness exists or that something foreign is inside or passing through your body.
4.	Delusions of grandeur – for example when you believe that you are very special or have special powers or abilities. An example of a grandiose delusion is thinking you are a famous rock star.
2.	Hallucinations – Hallucinations can take a number of different forms – they can be:
1.	Visual (seeing things that are not there or that other people cannot see),
2.	Auditory (hearing voices that other people can’t hear,
3.	Tactile (feeling things that other people don’t feel or something touching your skin that isn’t there.)
4.	Olfactory (smelling things that other people cannot smell, or not smelling the same thing that other people do smell)
5.	Gustatory experiences (tasting things that aren’t there)

&gt;**During my experience, starting in 2002, or perhaps a couple of years earlier, I experienced Delusions #1, #2,  and #3. Of the Hallucinations, I experienced #2, the Auditory. However, Delusion #1, the “delusions of persecution,” and Hallucination #2, the “hearing voices,” have been the most significant and the most persistent over the years. They have also been based in reality (i.e. they are neither delusions nor hallucinations, although given that there is no scientific proof of mental telepathy, whether or not the auditory hallucinations I experience are based in reality is up for debate).** Although I notice that the definition does state, “false beliefs strongly held in spite of invalidating evidence.” So, while I myself do not possess any “invalidating evidence”, **the fact that “invalidating evidence” does in fact exist, proves that my “delusions” are not in fact delusions, but rather a horrible reality.**

O_O
 
&gt;At any rate, whenever I think about the possibility of this happening – of **a person (any person) who experiences in his or her life, a horrifying variety of acts that exactly match the definition of a severe and incurable psychiatric illness, what are the chances? Zero. That tells me that this was not a coincidence and it was no accident. There was a reason this happened and there is meaning in it. I just haven’t determined yet what it is.**

Oh brother.  Yet another life transformed into a diamond-like state of unshakable happiness through Ikeda and his Ikeda religion.  Notice that she became ill 10-15 years after starting practicing in the SGI O_O

&gt;As difficult as it is for me to believe, every time I read a letter of encouragement or a piece of guidance from SGI President Ikeda, I find the following words,

&gt;*Whether we become happy or unhappy is not determined by other people or our environment. It is decided by our own inner determination or resolve. - Living Buddhism, September 2015 p. 31*

&gt;**I’ve always thought to myself, how can I be happy when I live day-to-day surrounded by madness and crazy people? How can I be happy when I am constantly faced with a seemingly neverending nightmare that I have no control over? Certainly this seems to be an insurmountable obstacle. Yet according to Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism and President Ikeda’s guidance, my happiness isn’t determined by external factors. My happiness is only determined by me. How difficult is this?**

Impossible, actually.  By now, this should be clear - you are being deceived.  Ikeda is, in fact, your worst enemy.

&gt;It is human nature to seek happiness outside ourselves, but the key is to bring it forth from within. I constantly need to refocus my thoughts in order to draw my attention and my energy away from the people in my environment and keep it focused on my own life and its more positive aspects. This is a big challenge – to bring forth happiness, wisdom and enlightenment from within – but it is the key to advancing in life and winning over obstacles.

&gt;*Our minds are more powerful than we know. When we are able to control our minds, our thoughts, and our emotions, we become empowered over our own lives. We also become stronger, and are able to positively influence other people.*

&gt;*When our minds change, we and our world also change. The Lotus Sutra teaches this as the “wonderful workings of one’s mind.” (OTT, 30) One’s mind, the innermost realm of life, is vast and boundless; it is dynamic…by changing the innermost orientation of our minds, we change both ourselves and our world…Everything is determined by our “earnest resolve.” - Living Buddhism, September 2015 p. 37-38*

&gt;This is what I was taught many years ago when I first started practicing Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism. I clearly remember being told, “Everything is determined by your ichinen,“ meaning “everything is determined by my earnest resolve.” This is difficult to believe, but faith and our prayer play a very important role. Every day I work on strengthening my faith and my determination so that I can persevere and see this fight through to a victorious end.

3y5bue,1,2015-12-24,I [22M] flew to crush's country only to be shrugged off (plus question),BirdSetFree,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3y5bue/i_22m_flew_to_crushs_country_only_to_be_shrugged/,"Reddit i need help. I'm feel like i'm about to go insane.

I'll try to provide some background and give you guys an in-depth view of how things went, and maybe you can see whether i took a bad turn or i should've seen it coming


I've met her about 9 months ago while i was on a project in her country, back then i was in a relationship with someone else so i didn't really feel for her or anything. Fast forrward couple months and we start talking more and more. The more i talked to her the more i was realising thats how i've always imagined my SO would be.


Now, i have been in quite some relationships but i've never felt so.. connected with someone on so many topics and aspects of life. Shes this kind and caring, nerdy type of girl, really good at both listening and communicating. As far as i know she had a long relationship but broke up a year or two ago.


We start speaking more and more, and i'm able to flirt with her responding positively. She keeps telling me on how i should come see her and even tho i'm trying to keep cool, its all i'm thinking about. One night being a bit tipsy texts me on how much she talks to her friends about me and wants to see me. You can see where this is going.


Even tho i wanted so freaking bad to go see her and i was so falling for her, i always felt a bit scared of commiting.

.


Fun part starts here, two weeks ago i get an offer for an internship from her country and the same city as well. And that was it, i quit my job, canceled my xmas plans and booked a flight.I was all in. Nervous as heck but there i was, going for it. Now i've never commited so hard in my life to just one single thing. But i was happy. 

**Now is where the downhill begins.**

The first week i had to attend some meetings and formal stuff so i could in no way meet up with her. On saturday i get to leave from a party early, already had some beers on board and i was feeling just great. I ask her to have a few drinks, she's responding super positively, gives me her address and there i go in a cab to her place.
Apparently she thought i was joking about the whole thing and didn't expect me one moment to actually come. She thought i was joking about the whole coming to her country as well. Things get a little awkward..but ok.. we head off to a shop grab some beer. We get home and start talking for quıte a few hours about random things. Now i know when something goes bad.. And that night it wasn't the case. In fact for some reason i was somehow expecting her to say something the following days. But nothin happened

.

Anyways few days later i'm texting her and she just shruggs me off, saying shes all busy. (shes in exam period; i graduated) 

Reddit, did i somehow fucked this up? Did i flew in with way too high expectations on how things would go? Was she just a tease?

.

 What should my next move be? I don't really want to give up..but what can i do? 


**TL;DR** : Flew to another country to meet crush; ended up being shrugged off. How should i react?"

Anyways, just wanted to thank this community for all the posts that made me realize I was in a relationship that would not work out in the long term. I am just going to type and type and hopefully fall asleep sometime, so apologies if things do not make sense!

I started dating someone in college my Junior year - she was a Sophomore. We got along well, and the sex was... well, I cannot remember if it was plentiful, but I liked it and I felt wanted, so as far as I remember, it was - and this is probably the wrong word, but I cannot seem to come up with a better one right now - enough. However, the sex started to wane and I wondered if it was my fault. Was I not attractive? Maybe she was a lesbian? All thoughts in my head. We talked about this and she told me that she had never gotten an orgasm. She had tried herself, had a partner who tried, etc. This made it feel like sex was a waste of time. I told her we could work on it, and so I bought toys, lube, etc. I even watched videos (something blueprint) to learn different ways to please her.

Then came a break in our physical contact - we both had internships that were far apart (East and West coast). I asked her to try and take some time to experiment with herself cause I believed that she could be the best person to find out what she liked and she said she would. We FaceTimed every day and soon enough, the internship ended and I was a Senior and her a Junior. The physical contact was there again, but the sex waned faster this time. Eventually I asked if she had figured out anything about her body and she admitted that she had not tried. Of course, being committed this far, I wanted to keep going and still try.

Long story short, the topic of sex caused a lot of fights, problems, you name it. I started reading DB when I came back from the internship and saw how people were frustrated with their situation. I did not want that to happen to me, so before I graduated, we decided to end our 1.5 year relationship.

I do not know if I said anything 'good' about her, but other than the physical aspect, she was a wonderful girlfriend. Maybe she is just asexual - or perhaps maybe she is a lesbian. Who knows. All I know is, I am glad that we did end the relationship because I know that eventually, I would become frustrated or maybe even angry and I would never want to make her feel sad or uncomfortable.

Since our breakup, I went on Tinder, and luckily met this insatiable woman who I have been seeing for almost 5 months now. I want to gloat so I will say that the videos that I watched along with all the effort that I put in with my ex has payed off immensely at pleasing this new girl. I have also discovered that I am more into pleasing her than getting pleased myself. I make it a goal to get her to orgasm at least ten times before I get off once. I just love being able to please someone like this - and plus, that O-face brings a big ass grin on my face. I just keep going until she says she cannot take anymore... But I know her, so I keep going again until she says her safety word.

That up there is the joy that I wish everyone here could have... Or at least some form of it. I wonder a lot why people here are with their partners who do not make them happy. I have only just got out of college, so I would not be wise about things such as how kids affect the relationship, but in the end, if one is not happy, why endure the hardship?

Well, my mind is kind of lost in thought right now. Sorry if the above is of the same quality. Let me know if you want anything explained.

tl;dr - Happy Holidays!"

3y9g8j,39,2015-12-26,How I Decided To Be Better,TheIronKraken,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3y9g8j/how_i_decided_to_be_better/,"I'm five weeks into a total turnaround in my life... I know that doesn't seem like very long, but I feel that the trajectory of my life has changed course for the better. This is my story.

**Before My Turnaround**

I am 27 years old... but let's rewind to 9 years ago. I was an honors student in high school, and developed a relationship with a smart and beautiful girl. I went to an elite university.  I had a 3.7 GPA after my first semester at this university... but then came a downward spiral. The cause of this spiral is very difficult to explain... so I'm not going to get into that here. But my grades plummeted because I resorted to hyper procrastination (not attending classes, not even beginning to study for exams until mere hours before they were to take place, and handing in papers weeks after the due dates, or not at all)

It would take me 9 years to finally graduate from college, as my pace of course completion became very slow. Some semesters were wasted entirely. I was fortunate enough to be able to transfer to a good school, but only after taking classes their as a non-matriculated student and proving myself first. I ended up graduating with a pretty good GPA... but my potential was still wasted, as I still made the minimum effort to carry me through.

During these 9 years, I went through 2 long-term relationships, and maintained a few friends... but I also went through periods in which I was socially withdrawn. In the worst incident, I hid inside my dorm for nearly a full semester, living in my own trash.

Since my last girlfriend broke up with me nearly 2 years ago, I have not even made an attempt to date again. Outside of occasionally seeing a couple of friends that I cling onto since high school, I have little social activity. I live with my parents.

I had very little job / internship / volunteer experience during this time. My resume was very thin.

Outside of two times when I exercised for a few weeks at a time, I never made an effort to exercise, play sports, or stay in physical shape. 

You may ask what I did with all my spare time. For years, I have gone in and out of addictions of various kinds. Among my addictions were poker, video games, and pornography.

In the last year and a half, my video game addiction became very strong. I developed an obsession with one particular game, desiring to be one of the best.

In the 7 months preceding my turnaround, I found myself staying at home, making little or no effort to look for a job, rarely seeing friends, allowing my video game habit to consume nearly the entirety of my world. I was heavily reliant on pornography to nix my anxieties. I continued to believe that things would just get better one day... but this was always my biggest mistake. By believing that things simply would get better one day, I allowed my downward spiral to continue far longer than I ever should have.

---

**The Spark**

Five weeks ago, I attended a video game tournament. It wasn't the first one I had been to. But nearly everyone there was... very different from me. I didn't particularly like the people I forced myself to talk to. Not because they were bad people, but because they weren't people I aspired to be like. This was an event I had spent so many hours training for, and yet I felt miserable. I had a moment of realization that this wasn't where I wanted to be, not right now... and not ever. For what had I been training so hard? What were my goals, really? It might take me years of additional training to be as good as I wanted to be... But wait a minute, I'm going to be 28 in a couple of months. Before I know it my 20s will be over, and I will never get them back. This was supposed to be the best decade of my life, and it was passing me in a flash. These were all thoughts I had had thousands of times over... but in this instant, it hit me like broken glass.

I spent the entire commute home fuming. Fuming at the Don't Walk signs, fuming that the subway couldn't go any faster... and fuming at myself for wasting so many years of my life. Years that had infinite potential that I would never get back. I was resolved to better. I wasn't going to allow myself to waste any more time.

---

**How I Have Changed**

The first step was deciding that I was no longer allowed to play the video game I had sunk more than a year of my life into. I packed it away, and said goodbye to all the online friends I had made in the community. 

I forced myself to stop watching porn. This is something that made me waste many hours on a weekly basis. It also stagnated my desire for intimacy with real women. Even when I was in a relationship, this habit wrecked havoc on my sex life, as I was able to be aroused more easily by porn than I was by my partner. In the first week of trying to destroy this habit, I encountered some problems. I tried to convince myself that hentai was still okay. I tried to convince myself that nude massage videos were still okay. After a couple of steps back, I eliminated everything, no exceptions. A few weeks in, and I am much more in touch with my natural libido. I masturbate only once every few days now (instead of many times each day). My desire for real women has increased dramatically, and the way I communicate with women has improved.

Following these steps, I found myself with a completely blank schedule. What was I to do with my life now? Here are some of the things I have done:

- I applied for a bunch of internships and actually landed one. It involves writing and editing, which is a strength of mine. I am making a real effort and have felt great pride in the work I've done and the feedback I've received. I have updated my resume and am actively searching for job positions.

- I joined a gym, started running 5 days a week and weightlifting 3 days a week. Now, I usually begin my day with going to the gym.

- I took up rock climbing as a hobby.

- I changed my diet. I now keep the snacks and sweets to a minimum, and eat much more protein.

- I made a couple of new friends, and have made more of an effort to strengthen my relationships with my old friends. For many years, they would always ask me to do things... but that gets old fast, and I've lost friends this way before. I've actually made an effort to reach out to them so that we can hang out and have some fun together.

- I did some major clothes shopping. I also do my own laundry on a regular basis now. I make sure I look my very best every day before I leave my house.

- I read. I've been reading some fiction, but I've spent the most amount of time reading about current events, science and technology. I'm turning myself into a more informed person.

- I write. I'm crafting some articles that I will be able to include in my resume, and even more importantly, I'm proud of what I've written.

- I cleaned my bedroom (and bathroom) completely. I got rid of all my old stuff that had been cluttering my room for years, including my old clothes and school papers. My room is now somewhere I feel happy to spend time in.

- I go to sleep earlier and wake up earlier. I used to go to sleep anywhere from 2 to 4 AM, and wake up at around 9AM. Now I go to sleep sometime between 11 PM and midnight, and wake up at around 6:30 to 7 AM.

---

**Reflections**

All of this has only been five weeks, but my life is completely different now. Although I still live at home, am dependent on my parents for financial support, and have yet to begun dating again, I feel like I am doing what I need to do to fix those things. I now have confidence in myself that I will get things done. For the first time in ages, I feel happy with myself when I go to sleep at night. My only regret is that I didn't turn things around sooner... but what's done is done, I remind myself. I can only look forward.

Do I worry about reverting back to my bad habits? Yes, I would be crazy if I did not, given my history. But I have never had a turnaround close to this magnitude before... and in my heart, I feel like this truly is the great turnaround of my life.

I guess the biggest takeaway from my story is that one needs to recognize their destructive habits and simply force themselves to stop, no matter how difficult that seems. Without the option to engage in your destructive habits, the remaining option is simply to acquire productive habits... But even then, one needs to find the desire within them. Even if you tell yourself you want to be better, you might be lying to yourself if you think you want it more than continuing your addictions. And that's understandable, because our addictions can give us moments of pleasure and fulfillment within a cruel world... even while they ruin our lives.

Your desire to be better has to burn hotter than anything else within you, truly. I know how easy that sounds and yet how difficult it can be. But once my desire to be better truly trumped my desire for all my addictions, I felt it burning within me like a raging inferno. My desire fueled my will power, and I was finally able to force myself to cease my destructive habits, and my whole life changed for it. 

I think everyone needs a turnaround moment. You need to say, ""today is the day my whole life turned around,"" and *force* that to be true in the days and weeks and months and years to come. 

I have written quite a lot. But that's okay, because I really wrote this for me. And if by some unlikely chance it can be an inspiration to someone else, going through similar issues? Well that would be even better."
3yanj2,1,2015-12-26,Advice for a prospective owner.,YungKob,BMW,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/3yanj2/advice_for_a_prospective_owner/,"Hey all,

So I need some advice from you all. I am a junior-year college student with a stable, very well-paid internship until I graduate. I was just involved in a motor vehicle accident (not my fault) and my previous car, a VW Jetta, is most likely going to be claimed as a total loss. While I prepare for the settlement, I started shopping around for cars. A friend of mine who is looking to upgrade his current '06 325i gave me what I think is a phenomenal deal on his car: 5,500 cash on the spot and its mine. The car has around 80k miles on it. 

Now I ve always been a BMW fan, and I really wanted to get a car that is more fun to drive, and this looks like a greta car to do exactly that. However, I am more then well aware of BMW's maintenance problems once the car hits 100k + miles. I have a steady income, so I think I would be prepared to do maintenance. I also treat my cars like children, I don't slam on them or drive them into the ground. 

From your experience with BMW, is this a good deal for me? Price-wise, I am pretty sure it is a great deal. However, I am not sure how much the cost of ownership is going to be and if this car will last me a long time. Ideally, I'd like it to last me 4-5 years until I am out of college and start making some real money. Let me know any thoughts"
3yaoti,2,2015-12-26,Computer science internships,luccsci,LoyolaChicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoyolaChicago/comments/3yaoti/computer_science_internships/,"Hi there,

I'm a 25 year old, married, non-traditional student looking to transfer from a community college (currently at a 4.0) into the computer science program as a sophomore. Initially I was considering to transfer to Northwestern but my ACT score was only a 24 when I took the test back in high school.

I currently work for Loyola University Medical Center and am considering Loyola because of its tuition discount among other reasons. Does anyone know of any students that have received internships at Google, Microsoft, or any other top tech companies?

I'm debating on retaking the ACT in order to better qualify for Northwestern. The financial aid scholarship there is fantastic. I would end up only paying $2500 a year in loans. Additionally, I love the atmosphere of the school. The next best thing is obviously Loyola with my tuition discount.

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

My issue is that i'm having trouble picking what specs I would need. I'm not the best at determining what I won't really need, and as a result I always spec high and under use.

So my needs...

I'm a college student who is becoming on the move from my campus more. Between trips to work, home, internships, trips, etc.. My Late 2012 iMac is stationary and can't be moved easily.

While on the go the system will primarily be used for Web browsing (Reddit, YouTube, News Sites, Social Media, Etc.), Word Processing, working in audacity/recording audio for a podcast, some minor video work if possible, and the occasional indie game on steam (Undertale, BoI, etc..)

What do you all think would be the perfect match for me in either the Pro 3 or 4? Obviously as a college student I can't blow big money so the farther away from a grand the better.
My concerns with the Pro 3 are if its showing its age, not being stocked anymore.

Some Off topic questions:
How does Comixology work on Surface? I read A LOT of comic books.

Are there any lesser known deals around? Microsoft seems to be sold out of most Pro 3's.
Thanks for all the help :)"

I'm 23 years old and graduated college last May. I was hired directly out of my internship and am looking to finally upgrade my '98 Chevy Prizm. I could use a little advice.

Grew up in WI, currently live in Denver. Accustomed to snowy conditions. I work in the medical field so getting to and from work RELIABLY is critical. I don't drive my vehicle all that much, but little commutes/occasional road trips are what I mainly do.

I'm looking at purchasing this vehicle and holding onto it for ~10 years or longer if I really enjoy it.

Preferences: New (2015/2016), AWD, decent fuel economy, attractive design (subjective, I know), automatic transmission, $20-30k price range, room for a few passengers/some cargo (don't need a minivan), moderate ground clearance

Initially I've looked a bit at the Subaru Crosstrek for an overall package. I quite dislike the hatchback style of the Impreza and Outback, but I am still considering other options. I would also REALLY appreciate any personal reviews if anybody owns the vehicles they recommend.

Thank you!"

My ex girlfriend and I fell in love with eachother and 2 weeks after, she moved outside of the country for school internship.

Ofcourse after a while we faded away from each other and every holiday ended in drama. About 3 months ago we broke up for those reasons, as our holiday stranded on the 3th day.

Since a few days she's back in the country and I have already seen her and even had dinner at her parents.
When meeting her the day after she told me her feelings for me we're ""complicated"". I felt really lonely since the breakup and I was so happy to have her back here, but she didn't felt the same way.

By coincedence I saw an facebook message in my ""other"" inbox, it's filtered so it doesn't show up normally. It was dated from september (3 months ago) and it said:
""Your girlfriend has been cheating on you with ***** ****
she has been sleeping with him for 3/4 months.""

It made me cry, because after all she still broke my hearth....
I called her immediately and she kept denying and that people hated her there. But I still got my doubts, as the guy the unknown person mentioned was already A LOT in the picture when we had an relationship.

Now I listened to my closest friends and blocked her and her family on everything. 
It still hurts me to not know the exact truth, but the relationship we had drove me crazy, just as the fact I still have feelings for her now and she doesn't....

She was my first girlfriend, and I'm 21. I feel so fucking abandoned and lonely now..."

This is just going to be an incoherent rant, I honestly don't expect anyone to bother reading this, I know I wouldn't. Also since I have friends that browse reddit this is a throwaway account since they would recognize my main account's name. I feel like there is something wrong with me, maybe I'm just depressed or I'm bipolar. I just feel dead most of the time, like I'm not really here. The only times I feel happy are when I'm doing something with friends but even though It's Christmas break they are all too busy to do anything. 

I feel like I've wasted my life and am continuing to do so. I'm 20 years old, I went to community college to get all my gen eds out of the way and to figure out what I want to major in but even after those 2 years and a semester break from school I'm still not comfortable with what major I've chosen. I feel like I'm just continuing school for the sake of making my parents happy, I'm unsure if I even want a job in the field I'm majoring in. The only subjects I really enjoy are history related but I'm too afraid to pursue a field where getting a job seems so unlikely. Not to mention my dad will despise me if I did.

I'm jealous of my friends, with the exception of one they all have found a major they enjoy and they know what kind of job they want and have already made progress doing internships to get it. I feel like whenever they talk about school they are rubbing it into my face without meaning to, seeing them feel confident about the direction of their lives just makes me feel like even more of a fuck up. The only one I can relate to is my one friend I mentioned earlier, he is even more of a fuck up than me and honestly I don't know how he hasn't killed himself yet. At least he has come to terms with it, I feel like I'm living a lie.

The more I think about my life the worse I feel. I've had opportunities other people wish for, living in a nice neighborhood, going to good schools, being middle class and having loving parents. But here I am, hating it all and hating myself more because I hate it all. It feels like a cycle that just feeds itself and brings me down even more. I should be enjoying my life and I should have some plan for the future but I don't and the fact that I haven't been able to accomplish either of those makes me a failure.

I have thoughts of suicide daily and I wish I could bring myself to act on it. Honestly the only reason I'm still alive is my parents, my dog, my friends, and a vein hope for my future. I have an idea for a book that I've been thinking over for three years now and have just begun writing it down. I think when I finish it and read it over, depending on how good it is I'll decide whether I should bother living or not. I don't see myself working a standard job, I've done office work before and have worked in retail and both jobs have made me hate my life even more. I just have a dream of writing some good series of books and getting rich or well off from that alone. It feels stupid and pointless but fuck it's the only thing I have going for me so I guess I might as well try it out.

In the mean time I'm just going to hope I get into an accident or something. I wish I would just be killed or maybe be able to apply for government benefits by being crippled. I dream of going to school next semester and there being a school shooter who either kills me or takes away my ability to walk. Just anything to end this stress and paranoia. Honestly, I don't think writing this all out has done any good for me. They say it's good therapy to write out all your problems or something like that but now that I've finished my rant I feel worse than when  I began. If you read all this then I guess thanks."

I've never been on this subreddit before, and I'm fairly new to Reddit as it is. I don't want to unload on anyone in real life, because I feel like it'll drive them away even further, so now I'm here. 

 I'll put some TWs just in case, because I don't want to hurt anyone. TW: rape, suicide, abuse

2015 is almost over and reflecting back on it, I'm shocked by how awful of a year it was. Fall 2014, I started college. It wasn't bad at all. I met some people, liked (most) of my classes, met a guy, started dating him. Then January came around and I moved out of my parents' house. They're verbally and physically abusive, and I had to pretend to be practicing their religion for them to accept me. They wouldn't let me live in my own apartment, so I moved into a student house filled with girls of the same religion whose parents were friends with mine. It was the only alternative to living at home at the time, and I took it, thinking things would get better. In a sense, being away from home was nice. I wasn't constantly stressed about the negative atmosphere I'd be coming back from school to. 

However, because I wasn't with them, my parents kept close tabs on me, which led to severe paranoia. I'm not ""allowed"" to date, and so if I was ever with my boyfriend and my parents called, I'd have severe anxiety attacks. My dad would stalk me in another car just to see where I was going or what time I got home. My mom would ask the other girls in the house to find out where I'd been and what I did on a daily/weekly basis. It was awful, and with every passing day, I felt myself getting more and more distant from my parents. 

The guy I was dating was my first, and I have insecurities that made it hard for me to convey my feelings to him. I always felt inadequate and didn't know how to word it, and it made the relationship complicated (for me). I'd wanted to have sex with him before, but it just didn't end up happening. The first time we did have sex, I didn't want to. I didn't feel like it, but I didn't say anything out of fear. Growing up with abusive parents makes you afraid to speak out or emote your feelings for fear of being treated poorly. I always fear rejection, so I just let him do what he wanted, even though it hurt. This happened a couple of times, and I would go home and cry about it. I always felt like he didn't care enough about me, and that if he knew all the things I went through as a child, he'd think I was fucked up and leave me. 

Eventually in March, I couldn't do it anymore. I tried to kill myself, but I didn't take enough pills and ended up in the hospital. I left, I told my boyfriend. He didn't say much. I felt awful. He didn't know what to say because he'd never been in that position before, and we both felt like shit. I didn't tell my parents about why I was in the hospital, said I was having panic attacks because midterms were stressing me out. 

In May, I got caught with my boyfriend by the girls I was living with. They slut-shamed me, called me names, and threatened me.Knowing they would tell my parents, I lived with my boyfriend's family for a month until they calmed down, because my home wasn't a safe environment at the time. 

I got into an internship that took place in Africa, and went away for two weeks in June. After that, I went to Boston to visit an old childhood friend who'd invited me there because she wanted to have a roadtrip. Her best friend came back just when I did, so instead of staying with her, I got my own empty room. For days, I sat in that room. My friend hardly checked on me or talked to me. I went 3-4 days without even having any human contact because she ignored me. There was no roadtrip. I just stayed in that room for two weeks. Coincidentally, my birthday was in July, and despite my mother sending reminders to this friend, she did absolutely nothing. I stayed in my room the entire day, felt awful and alone, and went out to have dinner by myself. I would have explored Boston if I'd had enough money and knowledge, but my friend, who is quite wealthy, had said ""all expenses paid"" when she'd invited me over, so I didn't have any resources. I felt fucking awful and my depression heightened and, while I was walking around feeling like shit on my birthday, I saw the train (metro? I'm from a city that doesn't rely on public transport as much so I'm not even really sure what it was called??) approaching and without thinking too much about it, I stepped in front of it. Someone pulled me back last minute but all I could think about was how much I'd wished the train had hit me. When I got home, my boyfriend and I were on the phone and I was pretending to be okay, but I burst into tears and told him what I did. He said he was busy and his friends were over. I was shocked and so, so hurt. This was the second time I'd attempted to kill myself EVER (and in the same year) and that was his response? I told him we were over, and I didn't speak to him for the rest of my stay in Boston. I don't think I've ever felt that alone and desperate in my life. 

I'm trying to keep this shorter so it doesn't bore you all to death but I came back, he begged me for a second chance and to start over, apologized for everything, including the nonconsensual sex (which he didn't realize I didn't want because I made it seem like I did) and after a while, we got back together as a leap of faith. I was back with my parents at this point, and determined to move out. I got a job, I found a girl who needed a roommate, I moved in with her, and things seemed to be looking up. My parents, however, were not okay with me moving out. They tried everything. They threatened me, they guilt-tripped me, they begged me to stay, they refused to let me leave the house, but eventually I did. Obviously, for the first week, I was just a huge ball of stress and anxiety because I felt so guilty about leaving my parents. I kept second-guessing myself. My boyfriend had just switched into the architecture major, and he was at the studio until 4-5 in the morning every day, with his earliest class being at 9 AM. I understand that he was really busy, and me being so stressed and hysterical that week must have been hard for him. One day, after days of working without sleep and being tired as hell, he told me he couldn't do this anymore, that I had too much emotional luggage and that he didn't love me anymore and he left. I was stupid enough to beg him to come back. Eventually I decided I would let it go as soon as I found out what made him stop loving me. He told me he didn't, but he was exhausted and so stressed from schoolwork and financial issues, and he decided it was the easiest way to end things. It hurt, but after long days of self-reflection, evaluation, and figuring out what was wrong and needed to be changed in our relationship, we got back together. 

I couldn't be happier now, with him. He's so supportive, he's always making me the happiest I've ever been, and he makes me feel like I'm the most amazing and beautiful person on the whole planet. My love life is wonderful, but my roommate turned out to be crazy. Someone has a restraining order against her because she beat the shit out of them, I figured out she's secretly dealing drugs to make extra money, she shows a lot of signs of being bipolar and has the shortest temper ever, and on top of that, she's trying to purchase a gun. I also found out she's stealing for me, so I'm currently looking for a new roommate. I've found some potential ones who seem a lot better than her, so I'm working on fixing that. Because she was stealing from me, and because I had some medical issues, my financial situation has been awful, despite having two jobs and an on and off tutoring gig, so that's been stressing me out lately too. 

I don't know how things are going to get better. Other than my love life, nothing seems to be looking up. I'm constantly considering dropping out of college and checking myself in somewhere because I feel like I'm completely alone in the world. My boyfriend tries to be helpful, but he doesn't even wake up when I have my practically daily nightmares that give me panic attacks (things like flashbacks in dreams of getting beat up as a kid, etc). I know it's not his fault, since he lives an hour away and he's always at work or at the studio and constantly tired, and I don't blame him, but none of my friends are what I would consider to be ""true/real"" friends. Besides, I feel like if I keep telling him about my feelings, he'll say I have too much ""emotional luggage"" again, even though he says it's the biggest mistake he's ever made in his life and he swears up and down that he would never put me in that situation again. I believe him, but because of my fear of rejection, I'm still scared. I feel that way with friends too: if they know too much about how I am, they'll get bored/annoyed/disgusted and walk away. 

I feel helpless. I keep trying to motivate myself to keep moving/pushing forward, but for what? The years have progressively been getting worse, with this year being, hands down, the most fucking awful year ever. I don't know what to do, what to think, how to feel (other than miserable). 

If you have any words of advice, or any stories of your own to share, please go ahead. I don't know why I even wrote this. I just wanted to get it out there. And in case anyone suggests this: I am going to therapy, but it's really not helping. "

3ydmeo,31,2015-12-27,I screwed up my first job.,Misterlulz,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3ydmeo/i_screwed_up_my_first_job/,"I just got done going through my father's computer. Back in October I found an unsent ""goodbye"" letter in a Word doc that was addressed to me. For whatever reason, I decided to take another look at it tonight - I was too embarrassed to give it a thorough read the first time, after all - and I just couldn't help but feel ashamed for myself. The letter essentially said that he was proud of how well I did in school and during my job hunt, and how I was ""gonna kick this job's ass."" Who knew I'd be out of work within six months.

I'll start from the beginning, I guess: I worked my ass off at school and graduated with a 3.78 gpa. Albeit, I majored in Communications, so the workload was a bit easier than a STEM or Business major, but I was so proud of myself nonetheless. That, coupled with five internships and a spot as editor of my college's newspaper, I felt that I was more than prepared for life.

I didn't really fit in at my school. It was a small, liberal arts college in the Midwest and the vast majority of the students were athletes. All the students, it seemed, stuck to their cliques that consisted almost exclusively of their fellow teammates.*Who needs friends at this place?* I would tell myself as I saw my peers socialize with one another. *When I get out of here, I'm going to be well on my way to an awesome career and a happy life.*

While I wouldn't admit it at the time - and part of me still doesn't like admitting it now - I think part of the reason I buried myself in my work was because I felt like a social misfit. I had one person who I could call a friend throughout the whole time I attended my school. I'd often pondered what I'd do without him, as if it weren't for him, I'd have nobody to hang out with. 

Once we lost touch, though, that would turn out to be the case. Still, when I buried myself in my work, I didn't really notice it as much. 

Nevertheless, I'd passively look down at my peers all the while telling myself how much more ""prepared"" for life I was than them. But really, when I look back at it, I wasn't. I wasted four-and-a-half years of my life studying. I learned a lot, sure, but that can't replace all the friendships and parties one normally experiences in college.

I have actually developed a weird aversion towards people who seemed to have enjoyed themselves at college - weird, right? Whenever I hear an older, gray-haired man reminisce on his care-free youth, or a young coed talk about how much fun she has at her new school and how many friend's she's making, I start to get jealous. It starts to upset me. It's ridiculous, I know, but I can't help but feel like I missed out on something that I can never get back and I have a tendency to let it irritate me.

The crazy thing is I'd be in the same position I am now if I just acted like everybody else for a change and partied a little more. I don't know, I just think it's crazy how society espouses traits like *uniqueness*, and *individuality* as something people should strive for, yet these values seem inconsistent with what gets one ahead in life: i.e. fitting into a specific, rigid box and molding one's self to societies expectations. Lately, I've been trying hard to fit myself into that mold; trying to become what people expect of me. It's easier said than done, but I figured it was worth a try.

At any rate, when I received this job offer last January I was so damn excited. I went through five interviews to get this job. But what I was most proud of was that I got it all on my own. Nobody helped me, I had no connections and I had earned this job offer through hard work and perseverance. 

It was crazy, the moment that I had been waiting for had finally come. After going through four and a half years of school and having to live at home for part of my education, I felt like an actual adult for the first time in my life.

My mom was so proud of me and had helped me a lot along the way, even when I was an asshole teenager. I remember she cried before I moved out of state for my job and said that I could always visit but things ""would be different"" now that I finally moved out of her house.

She was wrong. Within six months I'd be out of a job and within another three I'd be moving my personal belongings back home.

I know I didn't do particularly well at this job, but I was new. I knew nothing about the industry and thought that I'd have a mentor who would guide me and - perhaps, naively - hold my hand as he taught me how to manage a store. 

It wasn't like that at all, though. My two months of training didn't prepare for the job ahead of me and my first day at my new position I was bombarded with tasks I knew nothing about. It didn't help that I made a mistake my second week out of training (I sold a big customer the wrong paint) costing the store roughly $10,000 and, not to mention, my boss her annual bonus.

At the end of the day, my boss didn't want me there. She couldn't fire me - she admitted it herself - but she seemed to be on top of any little mistake I made. It eventually got to the point where I couldn't even ask her any questions. If I did, she would record it and run to the district manager or HR lamenting how I was ""X months along and still didn't know what such-and-such item was used for."" 

I knew not every store in the company was like this. One time I ran into a worker at another store while running errands for work. We must have chatted for 10-15 minutes while he spoke with me about the job and his past experience. He offered to answer any questions I had and encouraged me to call his store if I ever needed help with anything.

Looking back, that was probably one of my best memories of my job. Still, I really wish I had not taken that position, or rather, I wish I went to the Lexington store when I had the chance. The sales manager even *asked me* if it would be alright if he changed my assigned store after training to the one I was eventually assigned to. I wanted to be a ""yes-man"" so I agreed, and while hindsight is 20/20, I can't help but feel I made a big mistake.

The mistake is made even more obvious when I look at my bank account. When I finally left (when it was made clear that no matter what I did, how hard I tried, nothing would have worked and I would have eventually been pushed out of my position), I had over $9,000 in my account. I just took another look and I'm down to roughly $1,200. I remember spending that money on food. I was really depressed and started to eat a lot. If I remember correctly, I spent over $700 on food one month. Maybe that would explain the 20 pound weight gain.

At the end of the day, I know I screwed up and I know it was my fault. I screwed up a good job opportunity and I feel like I sullied my good reputation as a hard worker to not only my peers, but myself.

I'm hoping that this all happened for a reason and perhaps it did: I have decided to pursue writing in my free time and perhaps, with luck, I'll be able to get something published one day. I'm not a great writer *yet* but I know I will be if I work at it. I have faith in my self and I think my family does as well. 

I know this is just a bump in the road and that's what I keep telling myself. Some days are easier than others, though. It just sucks that, for the time being, I'll be out of work and I get upset when I realize that my career may have to take a detour while I work my next job - I really hate the idea of being behind in my career when comparing myself to my peers - but I know that if I work my ass off, try really hard at what I do and perhaps most importantly, pray, everything will work out in the end.

**tldr?** - I lost my first job out of college and had to move back in with family. I spent a lot of time working hard in school and was upset that my hard work in school didn't translate well into my first job.

3yekyk,14,2015-12-27,paganism + anger,aherewego,Wicca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wicca/comments/3yekyk/paganism_anger/,"I used to post here very frequently but I have not been able to recently (grad school, internship, work have taken over my life.) I have not been able to practice as much, and my spirituality is changing. I used to be very ritual based, but I've realized that it is time to make sure I am incorporating my beliefs daily - core beliefs, like harm thee none, threefold law, etc.


Now, to the question. Philosophically I have no problem with these beliefs and I try to embody them. No one is perfect by any means.


I had a pretty rough childhood and it has left me with a lot of unresolved anger. This anger is beginning to rear its head in my life. I'm in therapy. I try to eat right (I don't have time to exercise and don't enjoy it very much but hike on occasion.) I do give myself some basic time for self care, but it's never enough.


But my anger persists and grows and it is destroying me and my ability to embody these beliefs. When I am angry I want to destroy myself and everyone around me ... the energy I am beginning to build in this way quite honestly frightens me. I know I won't physically harm anyone, but I can be very cruel and I fear this. Even if I am not, the energy isn't good for me and I fear what happens when I will eventually release it. Sometimes I think about how I would enjoy cursing someone who has made me angry. These are VERY dangerous thoughts that I in NO WAY ethically agree with.


I'd like to note that while I am not a Wiccan, and more of a pagan, I do think cursing is a pretty big no-no. Some cases are gray for me but in the long run end up harming the person who cast them and are probably not worth my time. So I refrain from doing them.


Any interest in most positive spirituality things, like meditation, has left me. I don't even try to meditate anymore, I feel like I am forcing something I don't want on myself.

Perhaps I am no longer a Wiccan/Pagan?

My question here is, am I alone in this? Anyone go through something similar? What can I do to help me stay on my path - and deal with this large amount of anger I am working with? Is there some type of magickal tool that can act as a vessel to store my anger, releasing me of it, but making sure it stays out of the world?
Thanks for sticking through this long, perhaps icky post. All opinions welcomed."
3yesc7,51,2015-12-27,Al Jazeera Source Recants Allegations Against Manning's,PeytonsTaint,Colts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colts/comments/3yesc7/al_jazeera_source_recants_allegations_against/,"Here is the most recent update per Bleacher Report/ESPN:

Sly told ESPN on Saturday night that he recanted his story to Al Jazeera when he realized that it had used information he had ""made up"" to Liam Collins, a British hurdler and the undercover reporter who he said was trying to get into the supplementation business.

Sly said he was a student intern at the Guyer Institute in 2013 rather than 2011, as the Al Jazeera story alleges.

He told ESPN he was ""testing"" Al Jazeera's undercover reporter by dropping ""names like Peyton Manning, Derek Jeter, Ryan Howard and James Harrison."" He said none were clients. While Manning, Howard and Harrison were mentioned in Al Jazeera's HGH investigation, Jeter was not.

""When I realized Al Jazeera was using a secret taping and Collins as a so-called investigative reporter, I was baffled,"" Sly said. ""I cannot believe that can happen. That's why I recanted the story. It wasn't true, and I was trying to pull one over on Collins to see if he had any idea of what he was talking about.

""I was trying to determine whether this guy [Collins] was legitimate or just trying to steal some knowledge about the business.""


This honestly seems like a legitimate response form the source and makes perfect sense whether he felt he was prospective client or what he claims here is irrelevant despite what Pats fans may say. "
3yf5fb,5,2015-12-27,Is there potential funding for an alternative implementation?,PotatoBadger,btc,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3yf5fb/is_there_potential_funding_for_an_alternative/,"Hi, everyone.

As a software engineer, my best ability to increase decentralization is to work on an alternative implementation. Unfortunately, I'm a full time student with profitable projects of my own, a part time job, and full time summer internships. If there is funding for alternative node development, I could drop the part time job and personal projects. I'm guessing several others are in similar situations.

Is anyone aware of funding possibilities for a development team making a full alternative node implementation? I'm imagining it would have user-configurable BIP 100 / Unlimited / etc. support, and be a dedicated node without wallet support. Wallets would be separate projects, as they've been planning to do eventually with Core.

3yha6x,2738,2015-12-27,"Submitted my last check for my tuition! All 4 years by myself, no loans!",CEOChip,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3yha6x/submitted_my_last_check_for_my_tuition_all_4/,"Long time lurker of this sub. Just a little bit of a background...

I come from a working class family where not one intermediate family member has gone to college. Upon graduation from High School, I was pressured by my parents to not attend college and to pursue a blue-collar job just like my brother and sister. They believed that I would do just fine with just a decent job and didn't like the risk I was taking with college. 

I told them I didn't want a decent job. Now... I am aware that you can get a good job without a degree but that's besides the point. My parents were unable to help with any financial contribution to my tuition and I absolutely refused to take out any loans because of the financial burden it would have on my future after graduation.

In order to make this work, I ended up commuting to my college for my first 2 years. My 3rd year I lived in a 2 bedroom apartment on the edge of campus and this year (final year) I live in a 3 bedroom apartment on the edge of campus. 

Commuting obviously saved me a ton of money because of the rent aspect so my parents did end up helping me there. 

I ended up working about 30 hours a week since the start of my freshman year of college until recently where I picked up a 2nd job upping my hours to around 50 hours a week. Note that this was maintaining a full-time schedule with school. Tuition was about 4.5k per semester and I took a few summer classes which ranged from 1-3k per summer for 3 summers. 

During this recent Summer (2015), I pursued two study abroad programs through my University. I ended up applying for a large amount of scholarships to help out for this which cut the cost down to about 1/3. Before the trip...my junker of a car broke down and it wasn't worth getting it fixed so I bought a newer ish car for around 11k out of pocket. 

I lived sort of frugally throughout these last 4 years to be able to accomplish all of this and I consistently applied for scholarships throughout all 4 years as well. Scholarships took about half of the cost down for my tuition expenses.

TL;DR - Worked my ass off, applied for scholarships, kicked my college tuition's ass.

EDIT 1: Addressing some questions and concerns from the comments... I double major in Entrepreneurship and Marketing. I currently go to an in-state University. With my job that I had through all of college, I was able to do a lot of my emailing and research on slow days and I took a 1-2 online classes along with classes on campus. My 2nd job that I picked up for my senior year was a bouncer job (security) at a local college bar where the hours were 3rd shift so it cut into my sleep schedule but it gave me a secondary source of income.

EDIT 2: I just turned 22 as well. Some people are questioning my field of study as well as the University I currently attend because it wasn't expensive and prestigious. I have job offers lined up and am working with a job coach that is guiding me to phenomenal employers. For the spring of 2016, I landed an unpaid internship at a federal level in a nearby location. They are working me a minimum of 18hours per week which cuts heavily into my current workload and time. I know I am taking a huge risk with the ""unpaid' factor and my time but this will make my resume look very strong.

EDIT 3: The feedback here is overwhelming and I wish I can show you guys how much I appreciate the positive comments. I have been following this sub reddit now for quite awhile now and every story or piece of advice submitted on this sub has helped me and is helpful to others. Again, thank you so much for the positive feedback! Happy holidays!"

**First hour:**


* The studio has been disinfected again because Fez was in yesterday with his boil that may or may not be MRSA.

* Opie says that management told Fez he can't come back in studio until he gets diagnosed by a doctor. Apparently there wasn't any good news yesterday since they cleaned the place again.

* They have a new bunch of interns on the show and check out Intern Stevie, who is fat and has thick glasses. They read his ""bio."" They see some of his ""likes"" (Devo, Big Country) and wonder if the kid is retarded.


* Sam explains they have told Stevie he has to come up with a new bit idea for the show every day. They read a few include a really hacky ""Schlong Soda"" ad.

* They invite Intern Stevie into the studio. They ask him to come up with a second hit by Big Country, and he can't. They ask if he's retarded, and he says no but he gets that a lot. He explains he has an eye condition called nystagmus which causes his eyes to wander uncontrollably. They try to test his eyesight and ask how bad it is. They have him sing ""In a Big Country"" a capella.

* They find out Stevie and Ant both went to the same elementary school in East Islip. Also Stevie's parents recently separated. They ask Stevie why he's still a virgin. Opie asks to see Stevie's glasses, and he sees that they're all bent and busted up. They all try on Stevie's glasses and see how horrible his vision is. He's just short of the legal limit to be able to drive a car. They have him read a list of the top 20 mean names people have called him. Some of them are ones that Sam made up. Jimmy points out that Stevie has tiny hands.

**Second hour:**


* The top one on the list is ""Fat Drew Carey Motherfucker."" His least bothersome of the lot #20 is ""faggot."" They come up with some new ones as he reads.

* They have him read the ""Schlong Soda"" script over a music bed. They ask if he has any broadcast experience, and he talks about going to sportscasting camp. He says when he called basketball games he couldn't tell any of the kids apart.

* Listener comments come in comparing him to Mark David Chapman and John Candy's character in Vacation

* Someone also thinks he looks like the ""Warcraft guy from South Park.""

* Opie offers to buy Stevie new glasses if he lets Opie shave his head like that character. He relents and says yes, but Opie has mercy and backs down.

* Sam says they also have a female and a non-white intern. Jimmy boos.


~ break ~


* They talk about Michael Grimm winning America's Got Talent the previous night. They are reminded last year's winner was Kevin Skinner, and Travis says that Skinner's album didn't crack the Billboard 200.

* They play a Kevin Skinner song and trash the lyrics.

* Caller says the million dollar prize for that show is actually paid out over 40 years.

* Anthony talks about watching Death Wish 3 last night. He says the gang leader looks like Bill Burr and everything about the film is ridiculous.

* They start watching the movie and tear it apart. Ant says it was so horrible he couldn't take his eyes off it. They reveal that the gang leader is in fact the guy who played Chuck, Richie Cunningham's older brother on Happy Days who was written out in the second season.

* Ant talks about how some guy once chicks give blowjob advice by saying they should make a Charles Bronson face so their teeth wouldn't scrape his dick.

* Jimmy says the last Death Wish movie was cancer looking for Bronson and Jill Ireland. Too soon?

* Caller says his 12-year-old son was watching last night too and thought the movie was hilarious. Ant asked if his son enjoyed the rape scene.

* They talk about the character known as the Giggler. Jimmy's face gets hot in embarrassment.


**Third hour:**

* Opie notices a lot of suits in the office today, and Jimmy quips, ""There's a giant acquisition happening."" Mild speculation ensues. ""Is this guy coming in to fire us?""


* They play a clip of Jimmy's Raw Dog show featuring Bob Kelly talking about blowing a guy in exchange for a steak when he was young.


**Rich Vos and Bob Kelly enter the studio**


* Vos brings up hanging out at the ""picnic"" at Nick DiPaolo's two weeks ago, and they argue about the semantics of what you call a barbecue.

* Rich brings up Opie's messed up nose and gets off a few good lines about it. Then they tell Vos to stop immediately because he always goes one line too far and bombs when this happens. They talk about Nick's barbecue and the fact that Jimmy didn't get an invitation.

* Opie talks about being evacuated for one day for Hurricane Earl then going back after finding out it was a bust. He talks about catching a wave badly while boogeyboarding and hitting the water so hard he was afraid at first he'd literally gotten paralyzed while his wife and baby were sitting on the beach.


* Bobby talks about getting dragged by a wave in Aruba that also ripped his shorts off.

* They riff for a long time on how the show would be different if Opie had really gotten paralyzed. Ant does a Stephen Hawking voice.

* They make some references to Opie's ""imagination"" bomb from Tuesday. They talk about how paralyzed Opie would get his comeuppance from all the people he's abused over the years.

* Opie brings up his new gimmick of asking guys if they have ever intentionally taken a shit outside. Bobby says he did the last time he went camping, but it's not the same as Opie taking a shit on the beach. They catch Vos bombing then trying to pretend it didn't happen, so they have Travis roll back and replay the clip.

* Bobby says he has a friend in a wheelchair who rents himself out for people to take him to events so they will get priority seating.


**Fourth hour**


* They notice a cute chick outside so they invite her in. She's a NASCAR employee from L.A. named Sherri who just happened to be passing by. Opie brings up a story about Sandy Kane harrassing Kyle Busch's fiancee on their ESPN2 reality show.

* They find out Sherri is an ethnic mix of Mexican and black. They keep demanding she introduce them to Kyle Busch, but they later find out he already left the building. They mess with and flirt with her for a while, and she's a good sport about it before politely bowing out of the studio.

* Caller repeats a line of Opie's he thought was good, and Vos says ""I'm glad you got through to the pandering line.""

* Opie says he's dying to pick his nose, but he's afraid to because he knows someone in the room would catch him on camera.

* Vos may or may not be doing a show Friday because it's his and Bonnie's anniversary. They talk about Uncle Vinnie's in Staten Island which Bobby says is really beautiful; Vos and Jimmy say they haven't played that area in years. Vos talks about going to the ""dime district"" to trade in some jewelry, and they boo Travis when he isn't able to instantly pull the audio clip for them to replay. They tease Vos for promoting how good the food is a the club he's going to be at. They start piling onto Vos for a few minutes and get on a roll. Finally Chip chimes in to completely step on the moment.


~ break ~


* After having made a quick phone call, Vos announces he won't be playing a show on his anniversary after all.

* Vos wants to talk politics and asks whether Republicans or Democrats did better in the primaries. Ant points out that's a retarded question because both parties are just selecting their candidates. Vos strikes back with some shots about Ant gettin gized(typo?) during his own house party. Ant recaps the story for Bobby's benefit. It frequently derails into more jabs at each other.

* Bobby asks what parties are like at Ant's house because he's never been. They mention naked girls in the pool at Keith's birthday party, and Vos asks ""were they hot or your fans?"" They riff for a while on girls with ""one fuckable quality."" They talk about pissing in a jacuzzi and whether it's worse than shitting on the beach.


* They talk about MacFarlane's Red Dead Redemption and how there's a character coincidentally has the same name as Bonnie. 

* They mention Ron Bennington doing a voice in the game &amp; some of them whine that they've never been asked to do any voices.


* They talk about Vos' dentures. Bobby says ""someone went to school to make your mouth."" Ant tells Bobby, ""someone bought a steak to make your mouth.""



**Fifth hour:**


* They bring Blind Stevie back into the studio and immediately rip on his looks. Sam explains that Stevie's been working on a new bit. They ask him some questions about his eyesight. Stevie says he has a bit of ""OCD like Anthony"" to which Anthony objects.

* There's some more sparring between Vos and Bobby, but it turns back on Stevie again.

 *Opie asks to see Stevie's glasses again. When he hands them to Opie, everyone gets really worried for the kid but nothing happens.

* Opie asks Stevie to talk about his father, but Stevie's not comfortable with the subject. Bobby and Ant share father-issue stories with Stevie to try to draw him out. They can barely get through it without taking more shots at each other. Stevie talks about his dad taking him to see a &lt;i&gt;Rocky&lt;/i&gt; movie on a school night then wanting to theater-hop into another screen and beating Stevie to the ground when he refused. They ask Stevie to re-enact the scene with Sam. Stevie says he hasn't spoken to his dad since he moved out last October. They talk about it for a bit then start to tear into each other again. They never even get to the bit Stevie was working on, but they have him read Vos and Bobby's plugs on the air. They heckle as he stumbles through it then say goodbye.

I'm thinking bread-and-butter things that you will be doing so much that it's a huge time saver to just have it memorized. 

New approach. Two lists;  one of memorizable tasks/knowledge the other of pearls of wisdom/general advice. Equally important, but inherently different. 

**EDIT: Thank you for all of your answers. This is a great resource for interns and will hopefully be used as such in the future. I know several people have saved a link to this post. I am now going to make a new post were I collect approaches and resources for the ""Memorizable list of tasks/knowledge"" list. Let's keep the momentum going! New post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3ynr6o/resources_for_the_list_of_most_bangforbuck_things/)**

**Memorizable list of tasks/knowledge:**

1) Fluids. Know why, when, how much and what to look out for.
 
2) Nausea. When to treat, how to treat and what dose.

3) Standard pn orders: pain killers, sleep aids and antiemetics aka how to reduce nighttime calls from nurses by 25%

4) ""Reflex"" antibiotic choice for routine inpatient infections. 

5) Initial work-up and treatment of heart-failure. 

6) Initial work-up and treatment of  kidney failure. 

7) A sensible initial approach to ileus. 

8) Blood. When, how, why to replace. (added by me)

9) Pain. When, how, why to manage. (added by me)

10) Potassium. When, why and how to shift or replace. Credit: /u/findmyownway

10) i) Electrolyte management in general (wide net, but valid?) /u/propofalling

10) ii) Hyponatremia. Most common electrolyte disturbance, commonly mismanaged. /u/nicholus_h2

11) Commit the ACLS algorithms to memory /u/manya_died 

12) Differentiate pulmonary edema vs. COPD exacerbation
: workup and treatment /u/Imaterribledoctor 

13) Basic EKG interpretation /u/propofalling

14) Know when to order ABGs and how to interpret them /u/crazyshadowdog


**Pearls of wisdom/general advice:**

1) Appropriate follow up. When in doubt, follow up. Credit: /u/Gawd1 

2) Respect the history. History is king. /u/fivo7 

3) Respect yourself. You are a doctor. Your patients are YOUR patients. Approach their workup accordingly. /u/LolYourAnIdiot 

4) Spend more time with patients, less time with notes. /u/Imaterribledoctor

5) Don't understimate the importance of a good social history /u/Imaterribledoctor

5) i) Always ask and document code status. You may avoid prolonging the suffering of someone who does not want it /u/metalaco

6) Build a routine, stick with it. This will help you be systematic. /u/ImClearlyAmazing 

7) If you are multitasking you are not prioritizing. Splitting your attention reduces your attention. You are not an exception to this rule. /u/hashtag_ThisIsIt

8) Be brief and on-point during rounds. /u/telim

9) ""Remember there are things you know that you know, things you know that you don't know, and the largest category of all is things you don't know that you don't know."" - /u/General_Garrus

9) i) Know when to ask for help. Think about the worst case scenario that could happen for a patient in the next couple of days. If you don't feel like you can handle that, ask for help ahead of time. /u/General_Garrus

9) ii) Call consults as early as possible - it will save you some unpleasant phone conversations. /u/Obisean00

10) Keep a pen and pad handy. Write down tasks and check them off when completed. Actively prioritize /u/irish37 /u/hashtag_ThisIsIt

10) i) Write stuff down because you are a stressed out, over-worked, under-slept, under-fed human - you are going to forget unless you write it down. /u/ irish57

11) When in doubt, ask a senior. No one expects you to know everything. No one likes a know-it-all. /u/5shade

12) Prophylacticly check if everyone that needs to be on DVT prophylaxis has it. /u/dabeamer

13) Creative questioning lets you get the answers you need without ""embarrassing"" yourself: ""What do we normally do for this (general)/what have we been doing for this (patient specific)?"" is a nice way to ask support staff to remind you of usual med choice/dosing at your hospital when you forget. /u/OmNomDoubleDouble

14) Listen to and respect all of your nurses. Most of them will know more than you about your pts at this point. /u/brentonbond

15) Appropriate communication with nurses and other hospital staff. Know when to heed advice, know when to disagree with advice. Most importantly know HOW to disagree. /u/propofalling

16) Communicate with your patients (and relatives) - most of the complaints placed against doctors are because the patient wasn't kept informed on what was happening. /u/mr-mobius

16) i) If you make a mistake own up to it. A mistake is a mistake, hiding a mistake is malpractice /u/mr-mobius

17) (but probably nr. 1) Don't lie. (see comment) /u/ikkeutelukkes

18) Always ask why. This is how you learn. /u/transientz

19) Don't treat anxiety over the phone. Find out what's going on, might be nothing, could be something. /u/fisherpr

20) Go just a tiny bit beyond being polite. Small talk with other staff may seem insignificant but a reputation as a nice person will go a long way in making your life a whole lot easier /u/nooj

 
Any tips, suggestions, comments? Is there a standardized short list or reference you feel is relevant. 

EDIT: If it helps, imagine you're the attending/resident on a night-shift. List the 5 things which are so common that it would make your life a whole lot easier if all interns would initiate work-up and treatment without disturbing you.

EDITEDIT: If it helps, imagine your nephew/niece is 3 weeks away from starting their internship. They are stressed but have some down-time and ask you what is the most relevant thing to review and really understand prior to starting. You advise them to . . . "

2. What kind of fields can a petroleum major like me hope to apply to?

I'm sure this will be very basic to some people, but hoping others would find this very useful. 

**Wow, my first gilded post! Thanks mysterious person. Hope this proved useful for you!**

A few years back (I've no idea how long ago, to be honest) I discovered in some computer magazine that there exists these hidden tricks within Google to get the best out of their search engine and have been pretty much doing it ever since then.

This will be a somewhat long post, I imagine, but only because there's a lot there.

The various things I'll be covering will be Boolean searches - [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) goes into it in greater detail than I will be, as I'll be keeping this as basic as possible (and as basic as I know it!) and various other tricks.

**Boolean searches**

As mentioned earlier, I'm really not going to go into this in a huge amount of detail, especially regarding what is going on behind the scenes, because I genuinely don't know that.

For Google searches, the ones I'd use the most are OR and NOT (AND was included in this, but now I believe that Google recognizes any space as an AND function). **These always need to be entered in all caps, otherwise Google doesn't recognize them as operators**

**OR** would be used when you want to search for multiple variations on something, essentially, and brings back all the searches it finds. Imagine you're looking for motorbikes from all over, but you know they're referred to motorbikes and motorcycles in different places. An example of a search you'd use would be

&gt;motorbike OR motorcycle

This will return all the pages it finds that used either the word motorbike or motorcycle within their text. *I believe that you can also use the character |, making it motorbike|motorcycle, but I think both works equally as well?*

**NOT** is how you would get rid of search results that you know aren't at all useful to you. I would usually use the minus sign (**-**) as opposed to writing NOT. I would usually place this at the end of my search string, but I'm not 100% sure if it matters. *I'm sure someone will confirm if this is the case*

To continue the example from earlier; you're searching for a motorbike, but for whatever reason, it keeps bringing up results for some knock-off brand, we'll make one up and call it Kavasaci. You absolutely don't want this at all, so your search string would look like this:

&gt; motorbike OR motorcycle -Kavasaci 

Make sure there's no space between the minus sign and the word you want to remove. This will remove *all* the search results that mention this particular brand.

Boolean searches are more or less covered now, so I'll move on to other tips and tricks - I'll be ignoring the motorcycle example from earlier and using ones people might actually use frequently.

**site:**

We all know that many sites have an absolutely awful internal search engine, which is either basic as hell, is too confusing to figure out, or just doesn't work whatsoever. You can combat this by using site:, followed by the URL of the site you want to search for, without the www. I'll give some small examples below, but it is only really limited to the amount of websites that are searchable through Google.

&gt;site:reddit.com

&gt;site:reddit.com/r/lifeprotips

&gt;site:linkedin.com

What this is pretty much doing is telling Google to search this very specific website, ignoring every other site.

**"" ""**

Quotation marks are extremely useful in Google searches, because it tells the search engine to search for the exact word order and phrase within them.

As mentioned earlier, Google recognizes a space as AND (which will return any site that mentions all of the keywords within it). Let's take this example: You're trying to look for a song that you heard on the radio, but you only gleamed maybe one line and the DJ refuses to name the song. If you were to type the lyric into Google like this

&gt;mama just killed a man

It might return a load of results that happened to contain all of these words - maybe a sentence like 

&gt;mama just went to the shop. Back then I would have killed for a cup of tea. I saw someone coming towards me and I realized it was a man

To combat this, you'd use quotation marks around the exact phrase you know that you want to find:

&gt;""mama just killed a man""

This has been a very basic view on how to use Google. A lot of these can be applied to most search engines. To give one last practical example, **lets say you're looking for a new job**, whose description lists your skills, using LinkedIn's search engine. We'll use OR, """", NOT. This will be an example to show looking for specific skills and other keywords that would be useful.

You might look for - 

&gt;HTML OR JavaScript OR PHP media OR internet OR ""online media"" OR ""digital media"" -internship -trainee

You might notice above that there is a space between PHP and media. This is taking advantage of the fact that the search engines recognize the space as AND. It is being told that you'd like it to return all results that mention *any* of the keywords from HTML to PHP but *also* any that mention from media to digital media. This can be useful for finding very specific jobs. 

It will also get rid of any results that will mention internship and trainee.

And there we have it. A very basic view on how to use Google and other search engines, to find very specific things when it is required.

A lot of this has been gleaned from the people over at [Boolean Black Belt](http://booleanblackbelt.com/), which while geared towards sourcing talent/recruiting, can be very useful for learning new tricks.

If you have any questions, let me know. I'm sure someone will tell me I misunderstood some concepts and I'll most certainly update this if that's the case.

Edit: Fixed typo. 

Glad so many are finding this useful. There's some extra tips in the comments section that I absolutely recommend people to read. "
3yivzr,4,2015-12-28,Applying to jobs/internships outside of oil and gas,petrodoge,oil,https://www.reddit.com/r/oil/comments/3yivzr/applying_to_jobsinternships_outside_of_oil_and_gas/,"I'm a petroleum engineering undergraduate in the US right now halfway through my third year and I haven't had or got an internship yet.

While the petroleum industry isn't doing too well right now, I can't just blame the economy instead of trying to do what I can to make something of myself because I'm afraid that I won't be able to get a job when I graduate. After talking to a few people, many suggested attempting to get summer jobs/internships in other majors and outside of the college recruiting services.

I'm new to this and I'm looking for advice.

1. Where would be good places to market myself to look for internships/jobs in other fields?
2. What kind of fields can a petroleum major like me hope to apply to?
3. How can I change my resume or sell myself to seem appealing to a recruiter in a different major?
4. If the oil industry doesn't recover by mid 2017 (when I should graduate), what are my options?

I'm so new to the job market so any other advice or clarity is also appreciated, thank you."

You know there will be a challenge and are often facing challenges far bigger than you anticipated. The transition from school to the professional world does not have to be as challenging. Even with less experience, you can move your career ahead.

**Make a vision**

The first thing you need to do is firmly decide what you want to be doing with your career. Make a vision – determine what is acceptable for you and what it will be like in the future. Begin by determining what organizations you would like to ideally work for, be creative. Coming out of school brings a world of opportunities and now is the time to set the tone for the beginning of your career. Determine your acceptable salary and the company culture you want to work in. Would you like a more formal or casual environment? Decide on the location and the amount of growth you expect. Are you just looking for a position to get some experience, or are you looking to be working at an organization that offers several options for professional development?

If you are coming out of school for the first time and are not sure what direction to move in, consider seeking out informational interviews from professionals who are already working in the perspective sector you are interested in. Ask these professionals what it has been like and what made them choose their career direction. This will allow you to gather information and make an informed decision about what job to apply for. 

**Use the network**

After graduation, we often have a social network that is comprised of friends, managers you have worked for and professors. What many students neglect to develop is a professional network of industry specialists who have already started their careers. Joining an industry association is a great way to get to know others in your industry and look for a mentor. A mentor is a learning experience, it’s an opportunity for you to build a relationship with an experienced professional and gather insight about your industry, and the professional world in general. Another great way to build your network is to consider volunteering positions are also a great way to grow your skills, improve your resume and network. 

**Research trends**

[Becoming visible](http://craftresumes.com/how-to-get-noticed-in-the-job-market/) and keeping updated on current events in your industry will make you a much more marketable candidate. Coming out of school you have the theory and understanding of your field as a whole; however, subscribing to business magazines and researching on current industry trends can really give you a big step in the right direction. Often there are new pieces of legislation coming out and professional designations that you can obtain which will help you to move forward in your career.

**Make your resume more effective**

For several students a common element which can significantly hold them back is their resume. Often [recent grads](http://craftresumes.com/recent-graduate-resume/) have a resume that has not transitioned from the “school format” yet. When you are out of university you have officially achieved all the rights and provisions of your industry to identify you as a professional. Your resume should reflect that. But how do you put forth your knowledge with limited experience? Consider using a functional or combinational resume. These resumes use a format that explains skill sets followed by explanations of how you are able to perform these skills. For instance, if you are a finance major and have completed some internships or projects on a certain topic and know you could perform successfully in the workplace, you may create a section for that ability. You can follow this with two to three examples of how you worked with that skill along with a short description of the knowledge you have of it. Always ensure that your resume puts forth your most relevant positions of your field.

Another common concern that recent graduates have is the fact that they have worked a lot of service jobs and aren’t sure how to use these positions on their resume. Consider using the transferable skills such as math, analytical, sales, organization and communication skills. These skills are transferable and valuable. When [editing your resume](http://craftresumes.com/resumeediting/) still list your positions and keep the focus on the parts of the job that will be the most useful and interesting to a new employer.

Finally, never let setbacks get you down. Your career, especially the beginning, will be full of ups and downs. How you respond to and learn from your experiences will set the tone for your career. Always keep in mind what made you passionate about your career decision in the first place."

I'm not going to point my finger and blame anyone other than myself. *I* failed, and it's *my* fault. But I do need to move forward and achieve success in my future, and this is why I am reaching out to you all. By the way, I am a first year CS student.

I studied so hard for this course. Every day I did a bunch of problems. Went to the math resource centre and everything. But every quiz in class I kept getting 1-2/10 correct, and on the exam I don't even know what happened. I really don't think I had the background for this course anyway, as other people in the class were much better than me with past concepts. My high school math was abysmal at best, and i'm paying the price for it now.

My other grades came back fine, with high 70's and low 80's on the rest.

I find it hard to blame myself since I know I tried my best, but I guess my best right now doesn't cut it. So, **How do I move forward from this**? Do I get a math tutor throughout next semester and practice Math 100 concepts? Do I try to keep up with the Math 101 curriculum in preparation for when I will next take it? I'm willing to do whatever it takes trust me.

Obviously now I can't take Math 101 this next semester, and this means I will have to stay at school for the summer session. Not that thats terrible or anything, but I feel like it's going to be something I have to do. So I guess I will get to see what beautiful van city is like in the summer sun. 

Also, will this fuck up my future in any sizeable way? Will Google take a glance at my future internship application and go ""look at this guy in math 100 god damn what a chump""? Hopefully I'm not in too bad a spot, and seeing as I will have to re-take the class, if I get a better mark will that sort of cover this one up? Does first year GPA matter a whole lot? Did NASA actually go to the moon? Will I ever find true love?

Kind of scared right now, and Im looking forward to your replies, thanks for reading!

TL;DR 
First year CS nerd got dunked on and sideswiped hard by Math 100. Upcoming rematch in June. Need advice on how to prepare."
3yjgon,1,2015-12-28,Repeatedly failing on day 1. I have a few questions related to nofap in general and a few issues I have been facing. I am a 19 M looking for some guidance on how to proceed. The post is relatively long so feel free to pass on.,J_U_S,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3yjgon/repeatedly_failing_on_day_1_i_have_a_few/,"Alright, thank you for reading. This may be a common problem, but pardon me.
I'm a 19 year old male. I have been masturbating several times (usually 7-8 times) a day ever since I was 12 and occasionally to porn. I have a really high sex drive and no girlfriend. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not shy or anything, I am very outgoing and find it really easy to talk to people but I happen to belong to a relatively conservative culture and girlfriends are hard to come by. 
Due to a constant want to have sex and not getting any, I'm constantly frustrated. 
I heard of the nofap challenge last year and failed miserably. After multiple tries, I could only reach day 3. So I dropped the challenge, as I thought I wouldn't be able to complete it.
Now i'm setting nofap as my new year resolution. I am going to complete the 30 day challenge atleast once this year. 
I tried not masturbating the past few days, but always ended up doing it by the end of the day. I couldn't even make a day.
So I'm writing to you to help me with a few tips for the problems I've noticed.

1) Everytime I see/read anything sexual, I get a huge turn on and I can't focus on anything but masturbating. It's like my body is pleading me to release. It usually ends up with me stroking my penis a few times, then trying to control, then stroking and then full blown masturbation binge. 

2) I masturbate in batches. (I can't think of a better word). I masturbate like 3-4 times at once and do this three four times a day, after waking up, in the afternoon, when I'm bored, before sleeping. You get my point? So when I fail once, I fail HARD. 

3) I am so horny after a few *hours* of not masturbating that I think of weird stuff like stealing panties, forcing it on a girl etc. I would not go on a raping frenzy obviously, but I think I may have just enough drive to attempt it if I don't release myself regularly. And that will ruin my life. 
This is not a major possibility, but I am just hypothesizing that if I can fantasize about it, I may end up doing it blinded by sexual energy.

4) I have read frequenting to the gym helps, and that is what I had done last year to manage three days. Now I have a minor shoulder injury that will keep me off the weights for a month now. And I really want to do this challenge, because I know my future self will thank me for it.

I have found postponing masturbation to the evening (referring to me failing in the past few days) is also quite helpful. I have more energy and a general want to get things done. 
Now I am a total virgin so I don't know how masturbation is different from sex, but I have realised that masturbation is what has been making me so lazy all the time. I have accomplished a lot in the past few days itself.

Note that I am a student doing an long internship. When I am home, I am usually by myself even though I live with my parents because I have become addicted to my computer. I am working to convert this to a reading habit.
Please also note that I am not some lost child. I know what I am doing with my life and in which direction I am taking it. 
I am having difficulty solving my masturbation and pornography addiction/want. I have surfed the internet and it says that masturbation in any quantity is healthy and normal, and unless it is really interfering with your life there is no point in stopping it. Masturbation is not interfering with my life but it is a part of it. I have fights and other emotional issues and I solve them by simply masturbating. This would be a ""pro"" of not stopping. I use masturbation as a emotional release.


I just want to do this nofap challenge because I like being productive and I have gotten more done in the past two days than in the past two weeks. I am seeking the enhanced productivity, clarity, energy and a drive to get things done.
I am not a slob but I am really disappointed that I cannot even make a day of just simply restraining from stroking my penis.

I do not know how to proceed in this situation. Should I just leave the whole thing behind and continue the way it was? Or whould I keep trying in vain?
I do not have anyone I can share this with which is why I am writing this here. 
I would be heartily thankful if you could please tell me what to do in my situation.


    Additional Details:

        I am fairly fit, very social, I have a high IQ and dyslexic and I have never had erectile dysfunction, if that is at all relevant.

I got a profitable internship and my personal reward is splurging on a gaming PC for the first time! I'm looking for maximum upgradeability; I'd like to use this stuff over and over for future builds/upgrades.

&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Games: League, Fallout 4, Star Wars Battlefront, Battlefield, Civ 5, Steam stuff

Study/Work: Light CAD modeling software/rendering tools. Lightroom.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$1000-1250, can stretch a little but would prefer not to

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Next couple of months. I know this will be little outdated, but I want a template to build off of

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Tower, monitor, keyboard

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Massachusetts. No micro center.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

I really have nothing. I have a mac laptop I use for school, and a gaming mouse.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

Down the line, I may overclock!
I don't know what CPU/GPU or combo would be most beneficial in this price range for my uses.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

Small SSD for OS and frequent programs with a larger HDD

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Probably a bigger tower because I'm not experienced in optimizing build order/cable management.

I don't care much about aesthetics, but if worked together that's be a cool extra feature. Mostly looking for functionality, as I'll be upgrading in the future!

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

University provides a free copy of Windows 10! So no

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

Any tips on first time building would be awesome! I've never done this before, but I'm interested in these kinds of hands on projects."
3yk7r6,129,2015-12-28,"Financial Careers Overview (Investment Banking Analyst, AMA)",rowsforthebros,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/3yk7r6/financial_careers_overview_investment_banking/,"**Why this post fits here:** Given the demographics of reddit, most of the people in this subreddit are computer scientists and engineers.  But the concepts used in financial independence (income statement, balance sheet / net worth, time value of money, market efficiency, asset allocation, etc.) share many similarities with finance as a course of study.  This post is meant to serve as an introduction to just a few of the finance careers that can help you towards FIRE.  If you find yourself: making your own excel projection instead of using firecalc, looking into how the 4% 'rule' is derived, and modeling out your future, then these careers may be for you.

**My background:** I graduated from a top 20 school this May  majoring in finance and math and began work as an investment banking analyst at a boutique investment bank.  I have interned in the past at a well-known asset manager (active investing) and one of the country's largest private equity firms.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Investment Banking:** This is by far the most popular entry point out of undergrad.  It preserves a high degree of flexibility towards future careers and shows that you can work long hours under tight deadlines. Investment bankers, at an analyst role, are typically in excel and powerpoint producing various analyses.

Investment banking mostly deals with mergers &amp; acquisitions (M&amp;A), debt issuance (bonds), and equity issuance (IPO).  My boutique deals primarily with M&amp;A, so I can explain this in the most detail.  We are paid a fee to either sell a company or buy a company for the best price possible for our client.  Like a real estate agent, we are there to maximize value.  In either case, the analyses are similar.  

*Accretion/Dilution Analysis:* This looks at earnings per share (EPS) of the bidder (the buying company). This is simply net income (revenue less expenses) divided by the share count of a company.  This will change when a company acquires another company.  Revenue and expenses will increase by the revenue and expenses of the seller.  In addition, the company will be acquired using either (1) the bidder's cash balance, (2) a debt issuance, (3) stock issuance, or (4) some combination of the prior ways.

(1) The only additional expense is the opportunity cost of the foregone interest (this is typically very small).  This is why analysts are clamoring for Apple to make acquisitions.  Apple has a large cash balance that is earning little-to-nothing, and they could be buying companies with it.

(2) There will be interest expense due to the new debt raised.

(3) The company will have to issue shares to acquire the company, so its share count will increase, increasing the denominator in earnings per share.  Obviously, hopefully earnings will increase as well.

An acquisition is generally thought of as ""good"" if it is accretive (increases the buyer's EPS) within the next few years, and ""bad"" if it is dilutive (decreases the buyer's EPS).  This is too simple, however, because the buyer should consider long-term planning.  For example, in Facebook's $1 billion acquisition of Instagram, the deal was dilutive for a long-time.  They paid $1 billion, but Instagram was making no money.  However, over the long-term, it was a great strategic fit and Facebook was able to maximize the value of the company.

*Discounted Cash Flow Analysis:*  Under this analysis, one projects a company's future cash flows, including a terminal value.  Then, these future cash flows are discounted back to the present and summed to determine the overall value of a company.

With financial independence, my spreadsheet is a ""snowball"" calculation in which I save a given amount per year, and these savings grow at market returns to reach a given amount near my retirement goal. 

A discounted cash flow is basically the opposite of that. A company will make (based on estimates, obviously not reliable for most cases) a certain amount each year -- this determines the value of a company.  However, as always, I prefer the company to make this value sooner rather than later.  Say if Tesla, for example, will not actually produce cash flow for 20 years.  At an 8% discount rate, a cash flow 20 years from now is worth 1 / (1.08^20) = 1 / 4  -- one quarter what it would be if it were produced today.  Wow!  Anyway, this analysis is another way of determining the value of a company that is being bought, sold, or raising money in an IPO (initial public offering).

In investment banking, pay is somewhere is the area of 130-160k (including bonus) for a first-year analyst.  First-year associates (after 3 years of analyst or out of an MBA program), will make 250-325k.  This is at bulge bracket firms (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan, UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Barclays) and elite boutique firms.  **Hours are 65-100 hours per week.** Most firms, however, and now instituting weekend policies.  I am guaranteed off from 8pm on Friday to 9am Sunday, so if I wanted to have a girlfriend, I could.  It's extremely nice to know that you can make plans for a given day of the week, and it wasn't this way in the past. On a typical day, I get up at 8, am in the office by 9:30, and leave around 11. Dinner and taxi home are paid for. The pay and intellectual stimulation are great, but the main advantage is the career path flexibility.  With the ability to work hard and work smart proven, I can move to many different related fields with some of the following: more pay, better hours, and better type of work.

**Equity Research:** Equity researchers model company financials and rate various stocks.  For example, a consumer/retail analyst might cover Nike, Under Armor, Lulu Lemon, and 5-6 other names.  They attend industry events, get a feel for the companies and meet their management teams, and become all-around experts on the industry.  Hours are likely 50-80 a week, depending on the firm, with additional hours during earnings season, when the analysts will almost always publish updates on the companies they follow. The main analysis for this type of job is a simple 3-statement model, which covers the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.  If you can do a personal income statement and balance sheet / net worth, you can do this with some training.  A 3-statement model helps put a value on a company.

There are two types of equity research jobs, sell-side and buy-side.  Sell-side sells their research to buy-side firms who then use it to decide whether or not to BUY securities, such as hedge funds and large asset managers.  Buy-side researchers give their research &amp; opinion directly to the portfolio managers that make final decisions.

Hedge funds hire these equity research analysts to help them make decisions on which securities to buy.  A hedge fund typically raises funds from pensions, endowments, and the wealthy, and uses them to actively invest in public securities.  They are often paid a 2% fee on the total capital they invest, and take 20% of their returns. The employees are highly compensated and will also make huge bonuses if the fund has a high return.

**Active asset managers and hedge funds have a huge amount of resources at their disposal, including meetings with the company's management and expensive calls with industry experts.  They bring efficiency to the markets. They are why you should not try to actively invest as an individual investor.**

**Private Equity / Venture Capital:**  Private equity firms buy companies (either public companies or private companies) and take them private. They often put on high amounts of leverage, which will increase returns (in upside cases) and shield the companies from taxes via an increased interest expense.  They attempt to back strong management teams and companies with stable cash flows. They will often make operating improvements, such as reducing administrative expenses, better sourcing of materials, or expanding into a new product line.  

Growth capital firms invest to help a company grow.  They help firms roll-out nationwide, such as restaurants or retail chains.

Venture capital firms invest in a large number of early-stage companies, knowing that many will fail but hoping that one or two might become the next Facebook.

-------------------------------------------------

**How to Get In:**

*Out of Undergrad:* The following are hugely important, and they are generally given in order of importance:

1) Attend a top school, such as an ivy
2) GPA above 3.6, preferably above 3.8
3) Internships in similar roles: do whatever needed to do these, including loans or taking a second job during an unpaid internship
4) Examples of leadership (club president, etc)

After this, there are numerous technical and 'fit' interviews to prepare for.

*NOT out of undergrad:* Usually one goes through an MBA and off to investment banking.  It's often not possible to get an investing role post-MBA without having an investing role pre-MBA.

*Backdoor:*  I think one aspect that is really overlooked is the ability to specialize.  While I am (happily) a generalist in my current position, we have a lot of senior bankers with detailed experience in the sectors they cover.  If you are an engineer, you will be able to talk with and will have a stronger background for an ""industrials"" group. If you have experience at a tech firm, you will have a stronger background for a ""technology"" group.  I am on a lot of deals in the healthcare space, and its quite tough for me to understand, because a lot of it is description of molecules and the like.

This is getting really long, so I'll stop here for now and add anything I missed in the comments.

At an 8% discount rate, a cash flow 20 years from now is worth 1 / (1.08^20) = 1 / 4  -- one quarter what it would be if it were produced today.  Wow!  Anyway, this analysis is another way of determining the value of a company that is being bought, sold, or raising money in an IPO (initial public offering).

In investment banking, pay is somewhere is the area of 130-160k (including bonus) for a first-year analyst.  First-year associates (after 3 years of analyst or out of an MBA program), will make 250-325k.  This is at bulge bracket firms (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan, UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Barclays) and elite boutique firms.  **Hours are 65-100 hours per week.** Most firms, however, and now instituting weekend policies.  I am guaranteed off from 8pm on Friday to 9am Sunday, so if I wanted to have a girlfriend, I could.  It's extremely nice to know that you can make plans for a given day of the week, and it wasn't this way in the past. On a typical day, I get up at 8, am in the office by 9:30, and leave around 11. Dinner and taxi home are paid for. The pay and intellectual stimulation are great, but the main advantage is the career path flexibility.  With the ability to work hard and work smart proven, I can move to many different related fields with some of the following: more pay, better hours, and better type of work.

**Equity Research:** Equity researchers model company financials and rate various stocks.  For example, a consumer/retail analyst might cover Nike, Under Armor, Lulu Lemon, and 5-6 other names.  They attend industry events, get a feel for the companies and meet their management teams, and become all-around experts on the industry.  Hours are likely 50-80 a week, depending on the firm, with additional hours during earnings season, when the analysts will almost always publish updates on the companies they follow. The main analysis for this type of job is a simple 3-statement model, which covers the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.  If you can do a personal income statement and balance sheet / net worth, you can do this with some training.  A 3-statement model helps put a value on a company.

There are two types of equity research jobs, sell-side and buy-side.  Sell-side sells their research to buy-side firms who then use it to decide whether or not to BUY securities, such as hedge funds and large asset managers.  Buy-side researchers give their research &amp; opinion directly to the portfolio managers that make final decisions.

Hedge funds hire these equity research analysts to help them make decisions on which securities to buy.  A hedge fund typically raises funds from pensions, endowments, and the wealthy, and uses them to actively invest in public securities.  They are often paid a 2% fee on the total capital they invest, and take 20% of their returns. The employees are highly compensated and will also make huge bonuses if the fund has a high return.

**Active asset managers and hedge funds have a huge amount of resources at their disposal, including meetings with the company's management and expensive calls with industry experts.  They bring efficiency to the markets. They are why you should not try to actively invest as an individual investor.**

**Private Equity / Venture Capital:**  Private equity firms buy companies (either public companies or private companies) and take them private. They often put on high amounts of leverage, which will increase returns (in upside cases) and shield the companies from taxes via an increased interest expense.  They attempt to back strong management teams and companies with stable cash flows. They will often make operating improvements, such as reducing administrative expenses, better sourcing of materials, or expanding into a new product line.  

Growth capital firms invest to help a company grow.  They help firms roll-out nationwide, such as restaurants or retail chains.

Venture capital firms invest in a large number of early-stage companies, knowing that many will fail but hoping that one or two might become the next Facebook.

-------------------------------------------------

**How to Get In:**

*Out of Undergrad:* The following are hugely important, and they are generally given in order of importance:

1) Attend a top school, such as an ivy
2) GPA above 3.6, preferably above 3.8
3) Internships in similar roles: do whatever needed to do these, including loans or taking a second job during an unpaid internship
4) Examples of leadership (club president, etc)

After this, there are numerous technical and 'fit' interviews to prepare for.

*NOT out of undergrad:* Usually one goes through an MBA and off to investment banking.  It's often not possible to get an investing role post-MBA without having an investing role pre-MBA.

*Backdoor:*  I think one aspect that is really overlooked is the ability to specialize.  While I am (happily) a generalist in my current position, we have a lot of senior bankers with detailed experience in the sectors they cover.  If you are an engineer, you will be able to talk with and will have a stronger background for an ""industrials"" group. If you have experience at a tech firm, you will have a stronger background for a ""technology"" group.  I am on a lot of deals in the healthcare space, and its quite tough for me to understand, because a lot of it is description of molecules and the like.

This is getting really long, so I'll stop here for now and add anything I missed in the comments.

The grad school application bewitching hour is nearing ever closer, and around this time, everyone starts posting questions/freaking out about grad school. As per the rules in the sidebar...

**For questions about grad school or internships**

* Please search the previously submitted posts or the post on the grad school Q&amp;A. Subscribers of /r/iopsychology have provided lots of information about these topics, and your questions may have already been answered.
*  If it hasn't, please post it on the grad school Q&amp;A thread. **Other posts outside of the Q&amp;A thread will be deleted.**

That last bit is something we haven't enforced as much as we should have in previous years, but the readers of this subreddit have made it pretty clear that they don't want the subreddit clogged up with posts about grad school. 

Don't get the wrong idea - we're glad you're here and that you're interested in IO, but please do observe the rules so that you can get answers to your questions AND enjoy the interesting IO articles and content. 

By the way, those of you who are currently trudging through or have finished grad school, that means that you have to occasionally offer suggestions and advice to those who post on this thread. That's the only way that we can keep these grad school-related posts in one central location. If people aren't getting their questions answered here, they post to the subreddit instead of the thread. So, in short, let's all play our part in this. 

Happy application season! 

Thanks, guys! "
3ylc5m,11,2015-12-28,Just when I thought I was doing okay...,ind1goskye,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3ylc5m/just_when_i_thought_i_was_doing_okay/,"(On mobile, apologies for bad formatting, blah blah blah)

I was with a guy for 2.5 years, we finally broke up in July after a bit of a decline. It needed to happen, but the breakup did not leave us friendly with each other. 

I got to know a friend of his (long story that isn't super relevant) and managed to fall for him. Bad idea, I knew, but I wanted to see where it'd go. Let's call him Bobby. We were friends for a couple months and I knew starting a relationship wouldn't work - I needed time to heal, it was a friend of my ex, and I'd be leaving soon for an internship far away without concrete plans after. Bobby and I talked and agreed maybe in a couple years we could reconsider. In hindsight, I should've seen that as his way out. But I needed a friend and something to hold onto. Some sort of hope. 

We talked for the first couple months I was gone - mostly texting, but a couple conversations over the weekends. Things seemed pretty good. I texted him more than he texted me, but he'd never been super verbal over text. The last couple weekends before Christmas, when I'd be coming home, he couldn't really talk but I didn't mind so much because I'd expressed interest in hanging out when I got home and he replied enthusiastically. 

I got home and texted him to see if he'd want to hang out that weekend. He called me almost immediately - he never called out of the blue. Bad feeling. ""Hey, maybe we should stop talking for a while. I see [your ex] pretty regularly and it doesn't feel good talking to both of you. Maybe we can talk in a couple months, but for now we probably shouldn't."" 

As much as I knew he had a point, it still fucking sucked. And I knew he was telling me he was done. He won't contact me. He chose his friend - as I, deep down, had known he would do. Because why choose some girl it might not work out with over your friend? But for some reason I kept talking to him, never badmouthing my ex (who had given me plenty of reasons to bad mouth him) so as not to be That Ex. I wanted to make things work. 

So now I had to wonder how long he'd been putting off telling me that. Had it been the whole couple months I was at my internship? A couple weekends? It's also stupid because he had basically told me to do the same thing with my ex - telling me to wait until our lease was up to break up with him, to act normal until then, so as to avoid a ton of confrontation. I didn't wait, because that's fucking terrible advice, but now I'm like ""so he does follow his own advice. Interesting.""

So this was, what, a week and a half ago? And I'm doing okay. We were involved for a couple months so I was dealing with the whole ""so many things remind me of him"" which sucked, but I knew time would make it better. 

Today I get a text from my roommate from my university: ""guess who I saw at my work today? Bobby and his current significant other."" What. The. FUCK. It felt like someone had punched me in the stomach when i read that. How long has he been with her? Is that why he was ""busy""? Is that the REAL fucking reason he wanted to stop talking? Fuck him. FUCK. HIM. I'm so hurt and angry and upset. 

I don't know what I want from posting this. I just...I'm so upset with how things ended. I'm upset that they DID end, though he's proving that he's not someone I'd want to be with, if he can't fucking communicate when something is difficult for him. 

TL;DR: if I ever needed a sign to cut contact with someone, I got a big one with fucking neon flashing lights and a goddamn brass band. Fuck. "
3ylwf4,10,2015-12-28,Recent MS BME grad looking to network with engineers in the industry,ramblin-rekt,bioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioengineering/comments/3ylwf4/recent_ms_bme_grad_looking_to_network_with/,"Hi everyone,

I recently finished my masters in BME and I’m looking to network with alumni that are in the industry. 

I haven’t had much luck with the job hunt despite having ~12 months of internship experience (R&amp;D) at 3 different BME companies over the past 2 years as a part of my masters degree. 

My GPA is good, and I’m fairly confident that I’ve got a solid resume, but unfortunately the traditional job hunt route hasn’t yielded much. 

I’m hoping that through networking with some engineers that currently in the industry,  I can perhaps improve my chances at landing an interview. 

I have generally performed well at interviews, and have a lot of confidence in my interviewing skills – I just haven’t been able to get a chance to show it yet. 

Happy holidays and Thank you!

3ym6zv,7,2015-12-28,"Its scary sometimes asking yourself who you are, and what you want out of life.",Green_Tea_Dragon,sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/3ym6zv/its_scary_sometimes_asking_yourself_who_you_are/,"Hey Reddit, took me quite a while to actually get around to posting this hopefully it’s in the right area or ill surly get down voted into oblivion for sure.
 I have never posted something on Reddit before, but always finding myself reading comments and random threads to odd hours (not so much anymore). I didn’t even have a profile before this post.
Stick with me I swear this wall of text isn’t just me losing my mind!
Funny thing is I’m not really sure why I’m posting this to be honest, maybe it’s just to vent or have my story heard? Maybe to get feedback that, yes my life is indeed just a huge glorified “stage” or perhaps I am actually growing as a person and getting out of that nasty circle of negative thoughts that I have been in for years?

Hmmm where to start? How about with myself? I’m 22M, My relatively small group of friend usually see me as the “dreamer” of the group(they can be just as much!), I have gone from being a police officer for 6 months(wasn’t my thing), day trader  then trying to think of an idea for a small business. Now I can see where the dreamer part comes in. Thinking back I probably did sound pretty naïve, always calling my buddies ecstatic about a new idea or thing we could buy and sell from alibaba or online private labeling. I even had a job as a paid intern for a local (very popular) bar to teach me how to run a business; the owner took to liking me pretty quick. But like most great things, they come to an end. My main source of income now is my eBay store; I sell things I get from estate sells and thrift stores. Don’t be fooled I only make enough to cover gas and going out (I still live at home with my parents.)
Still reading? You my friend will deserve gold at the end of this.
My family is relatively wealthy, my mother is a tech with a local fortune 500 company and my father is a forty year detective vet with my home town’s police department. My father is a huge local figure in a way, if we ever eat out it isn’t uncommon for someone to come up to my family while eating and chat with my father and them leave and find out that was the town’s freaking mayor. If I’m ever riding around town and a police officer sees me I usually get a smile and a wave and if I’m out of the car usually a conversation. The usual ‘how’s your father’ blah blah blah. My father always wanted me to join the force with him, I tried and I failed. I always get self conscious when talking to my father coworkers because the question “are you still in law enforcement?” will usually be asked, and of course be answered with a usually pitiful grouping of the word “umm and err” and the word eBay at the end.
Now this is where I kind of lose structure or whatever in the hell I’m writing here. I’m so used to suppressing my emotions I find myself going back and trying to reword things I’m typing even now. 
Growing up I was diagnosed with ADHD and later I was pegged with an “anxiety problem” put in “special” classes from 4-7 grade(not all my classes)I hated them, I always felt like I wasn’t normal or something since I couldn’t go with my other friends to lunch. Around those times I was bullied for my weight (the ADHD med were to blame) quite a bit and at first I tried to speak out about it but it seemed after a while it kind of fell on closed ears and I just dealt with it. Around those times I was very much hooked on video games and from then on out I would opt to just close myself in my room and play video games for 8+ hours a day, even getting to the point I was staying up and falling asleep in class, skipping showers. I hate myself so much for those days I spent glued to a TV screen rather than spending time with my grandmothers or making actual friends.
 My mom is much like my dad(keep that in mind)he’s a very stoic man, my entire life I have NEVER seen the man even anywhere close to what someone would call sad, he always had a Slight smile, straight face or pissed and he was big on punishment. Around 6-7th grade my family was hitting the time where my family started to drift apart (uncles, aunts, cousins etc) when a long string of deaths happened in my family, after sitting down with my sister (29yo) after my last grandmothers death she told me “you know, thinking about it we’ve been to about 21 funerals (family and family friends) in both of our lives.” I just kind of laughed and told her she’s right. Some of the things that clicked about my own emotional state and acted as a slap in the face on what I was becoming, was that  I get a lot of my mannerisms from my dad, I never cried at any of the funerals(or in front of anyone),even families funerals I just stoned faced thought the whole thing , even when slide shows of happy times with said members were being played, I would  never want to live those moments again. Trying to stay straight faced while you see smiling photos of that dead family member who you’ll never see again until it’s your time to go as well(unless you don’t believe in that).
I left so much out but I have been putting off posting this for probably about a month, so I need to get this out before I somehow find myself a week later procrastinating. Bear with me please!!!!!!
After high school I started getting into cross fit and lost about 60 pounds, I was eating organic and drinking nothing but coffee, green tea, water and whey protein drinks. Now I smoke, usually to the point where I’m glued to the couch with my buddies. The other day high school was brought up and how things panned out, I didn’t really have any friends in high school but I also didn’t have any enemies, just a ton of acquaintances. I had a lot of people I would talk to in school just never out of school. i would go back and change soooo much in my life If I could. After talking about the old days in school one of my friends looks at me and says he wished he had my life because I always seen so chilled, as I was one of the nicest people he’s ever met, all I could do is laugh and shake my head, trust me you don’t. A failure that probably tarnished my mom and dad’s rep as good parents and their long careers.

Currently I find myself I think its depression, I saw a post I liked a few days ago on how it is that I really liked. I’m so sorry I’m not sure who said it or I would quote you but it went along the lines of “if I wanted to do something and the options were there like in mass effect or fall out and a few of the options were grayed out and you couldn’t for the life of you choose them” or something along those lines. I have tried to convince myself to at least get back out there and jog a few days. Even bought some cleats and thought about trying soccer again or taking a martial art class. Making my health shakes again but those are even hard to do sometimes and it’s just fucking getting a few ingredients like, just get them out lazy ass and put them in the blender. 
My latest thing I have looked at doing is perhaps going to get my BA in English and teaching English in Japan with the jet program, I love the culture, but I doubt it’ll happen. I still have hope grant (pays for college pretty much) but my GPA is on the edge, if I fail a class I will lose it. My anxiety usually keeps me from doing or acting on anything.
I’m so sorry about this freaking wall or book of text guys not really sure what else to do I kind of understand after years of dealing with this I might not be able to get myself out of my own mess that is my head. I hope you guys had a great day and holidays or managing at least.

3ympfs,22,2015-12-29,Advice for a Rails bootcamp grad struggling to find work.,__iceman__,rails,https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/3ympfs/advice_for_a_rails_bootcamp_grad_struggling_to/,"As a graduate of a Rails bootcamp in Atlanta, I'm surprised by how difficult it has been to find a job.  I come from a non-tech /CS background but have always had an affinity for tech and grew up on the internet (like early 90's dial up!)  I finished the Rails bootcamp back in April and have been on the job hunt ever since.  I've done a few code challenges, over 6,000 points on Treehouse(Ruby, Rails, SQL, Git), some of the Rails/Ruby/TDD courses on Upcase, Rails/Ruby on Codecademy &amp; CodeSchool.  I recently finished a two month internship at a local start earlier this month.  I attend the Ruby meetups here in Atlanta and I try to be active on some of the Slack chatroom forums.  I'm beginning to teach myself Angular as well.  

I feel like I've put in a lot of effort on the job front as well.  I've applied to at least 40 + jobs but only have received one offer from a company out of the Atlanta area.  Any advice for someone in my situation?  I'm a pretty outgoing and social person, so I don't need to be told to ""put myself out there"" (I bartend for a living, so small talk is an essential thing I've learned.)  I got the internship by introducing myself to the CEO at a meetup.  I'm not opposed to relocation, but I would need help from the employer. 

I seem to get a lot of push back for not having any CS background.  Any practical way around this or ways to get some CS street cred?  Read some books on data structures and algorithms?  How can I display CS core competencies?

I plan to work on a personal project of a Rails API with an Angular front end to keep myself busy.  My final project from the bootcamp was a JSON API with an Angular front end (Angular done by another student taking the front end course.)

As far as a junior Rails developer salary goes, what is an acceptable salary range for someone in my position?"

Over the summer we had almost 3 months apart before he was going to come visit my family and me for two weeks. During this time apart he became quite jealous, and agonised over the thought of my cheating on him while out with my friends. I've given him no reason to think this, except for things that happened before we became exclusive. Anyway, one night he got very drunk with his fellow interns and had sex with one of them, who also was/is in a relationship. He didn't plan on ever telling me and we had an amazing fall semester together. 

It's winter break now and we're apart for a month, he just broke this news to me yesterday. I don't know what to do. For starters, he betrayed me in one of the worst ways possible, but he also made a terrible assumption about me and used that to justify his actions. He says the reason he finally decided to tell me is because he now see's a future with me, he loves me, this I believe. And I love him. But I can't see myself staying with him as this pain is just gonna slap me in the face if we ever go through a slightly rough patch. How can I ever trust him again? He's my best friend in college and most of our friends are mutual, so ending this relationship would probably make me very lonely.

Or focus on my future and then check back on her?,hrvatsko,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3yn1wt/do_you_think_its_the_right_time_to_start_dating_a/,"I'm a third year in college and I really like this girl and have for over a year now.  She is a year younger than me, I met her last year on the first day of move-in in a huge coincidental situation.  She also has the same birthday as me.  It all seemed like it was gonna work out great. 

Unfortunately, a year ago I got pretty sick and went home for a month before winter break last year but we would text almost every day.  When I got back, we both expected to start hanging out but I decided to focus on other things.  I have really been excelling in my business finance major with school and internships, I am a very social guy with many friends, I've made some good money for myself, and I know I am definitely taking the right steps towards becoming a very wealthy and successful man.  I think about my career, future, and investments every day and I love it.  

But recently I have been thinking a lot about her.  It seems like she is doing very good as well, she's really into fashion and seems very driven.  I know she is a great girl, and I definitely want to be with her one day.  But I don't know if that time should be now. I am very focused and trying to get my life organized while trying to be completely independent.  But at the same time, I don't want to miss my chance for this great girl. The type of girl I would marry. 

I don't know if having a girlfriend would distract me and make me think about her during my day when I would normally be thinking about things that would help better myself and my future.  My number one priority is to have a successful future and be financially very well off, but having an amazing girl is also important to me and I think this is something I'll regret if I miss. 

I think she would still be down to date me, but it's hard to actually conjure up the strength to take it to that level and start talking to her again.  And there's the fact of me being unsure about the whole thing. What do you guys think?"
3yn782,39,2015-12-29,"I think I just dodged a bullet, in the form of the sketchiest landlord I've ever met ...",Whinnie,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3yn782/i_think_i_just_dodged_a_bullet_in_the_form_of_the/,"Sorry if this post is very unorganized -- this is my first time posting here and I'm still a little bit shaken up. I'm not particularly looking for advice (because I think the issue has been resolved?), but if anyone could share similar stories or sentiments I'd love to hear them -- and if not, just consider this a cautionary tale to keep in mind when you look for your own place!

For the past few days I've been looking for cheap student housing close to my city's downtown area because I'll be starting an 8-month internship around there in January. I'm not sure how common this is for other areas, but here gender and racial preferences (e.g., ""females only"") are very common for listings. So last night I found a female only listing that had everything I was looking for -- furnished and all inclusive, very reasonably priced, short commute from work -- and so my parents and I went to see the place earlier today. The listing also indicated ""Asians preferred"" and no one here ever states a preference for Asians (this is relevant), but I thought, ""Well, it's probably a house that's owned by an Asian couple, so they'll probably be fine with me because I'm Asian, right?""

Turns out I was far from the truth and that the property was an apartment unit owned by some dude in his late 20s/early 30s. It had a bedroom, bathroom, living room, and kitchen, and it was actually pretty nice. The landlord seemed very friendly (almost TOO friendly, now that I think back on it ...) and said that he was renting out the bedroom to help him pay rent, since he also lived in the unit and slept in a section of the living room separated by opaque screens. He mentioned that he'd rented out to several students in the past including five Japanese girls and a Spanish dude, among others, and that he liked cooking and didn't mind sharing food with his roommate. He also showed me some photos on his phone of him with some of his old roommates (they were all female). I asked him why he preferred Asian girls for roommates and was expecting a landlord-like response like, ""In my experience they're easiest to live with."" But instead he told me that he was interested in Asian culture since he was a kid and included some other backstory about his life, including the fact that he had ""tried a relationship"" but it hadn't worked out and for the past 8 months he had been trying to get his life back on track.

Anyway I think you know where this is going, but at the time my gut instinct didn't feel like anything was wrong and I was thinking, ""All kinds of people are really into Asian culture, right? And even if this dude is into his roommates, he seems like he'll back off once he finds out I have a boyfriend?"" Plus I really liked the place and so did my parents, so we put down a rent deposit immediately in exchange for the keys and my dad and I went to get the money as well as my younger sister from the car. As soon as we came in my sister whispered to me, ""Are you sure you're okay with this? This seems really sketch,"" before telling me to look for hidden cameras in the room because /r/LetsNotMeet made her super paranoid. I just kind of laughed her off. But then right before we left, the landlord mentioned that his neighbours were really nosy and that he didn't like talking to them so if any of them asked me what I was doing, I should ""say something like you're living with your boyfriend"".

I don't know what I was thinking at this point but as soon as I got back home, I phoned my (actual) boyfriend and told him everything about the place, including everything the landlord said and how he acted. His response was, ""Yeah, I'm getting a really bad feeling about this and I know I can't tell you where to live, but the more you talk about it the worse it sounds."" I also called up one of my close older female friends and she said, ""I don't have a bad feeling, but it is a weird feeling. It's a strange setup. Even if he respects your boundaries, it'll be awkward living in super close quarters like that, especially when your boyfriend visits.""

I think my dad also felt something because he started telling me about how there's a device out there that can scan for hidden cameras and he was considering buying me one. So I blurted out, ""Dad, I changed my mind because I talked to my friends and they all said they had a bad feeling about this place,"" and after a moment he simply said, ""Okay, call him and see if we can return the keys and get our money back this evening. We can leave now, it's not that late."" So I phoned the guy and as soon as I told him I'd changed his mind he went from being super warm and friendly to kind of hostile, and he told me that I would only get half of my deposit back (which is actually illegal). So my mom took over the call with him and got him to concede to giving us 90% of the money now and the other 10% next week because he admitted that he'd already ""spent it"" and didn't get paid until then. And then my parents and I drove all the way across the city in a raging snowstorm as I told them exactly what was written in the listing description, and then my dad pointed out, ""That explains why he was saying that he didn't mind cooking for you. He probably wanted you to sit down and have dinner with him.""

Anyway my parents have most of their money back, and they got the landlord to sign a note saying that he returned 90% of the money and that we'll come to pick up the remainder next week at the specified time. (Apparently when my parents went up to meet him, he didn't say anything. Even though earlier he was super talkative and after meeting us he sent me a text where one of the sentences said, ""I enjoyed meeting your family :)"".) I'm kind of bummed that the place was too good to be true, but I don't mind settling for another place. Better safe than sorry, and I hope all you 2xcers can also stay safe!

**TL;DR: Didn't realize that landlord was a creepy dude who (possibly) preys on his female tenants. Was ready to move in until three people closest to me advised me not to. Got most of my deposit back. The red flags were all there, it just took me a while to realize them as flags.**"

I'm dominant and into many kinks. I am pretty open for some play today but here are a few prompts.

1- cheat on your man with me. This can go a few ways. But I am mostly looking for you to be mad at your boyfriend/husband and come to me ready to fuck. Setting and characters are up for discussion.

2- the prostitute. You're hard up for cash and you decide to see what you can get for your body. You post on the website like Backpage or craigslist and hope for the best. You get a call from me and schedule a time to come over to my house. When you get there you realize that we know each other, either from work or the gym or somewhere. You get embarrassed and try to leave but I make you go through with it. This one would be a dub con

3- the intern. I'm the boss of a sales team. We hire you as an intern. You are extremely naïve and believe anything I say. I convince you that it's normal for an intern to suck her boss' cock after hours.

I love deep throat, light bondage, age play, anal, cum shots, and more. I'm up for these or any other ideas that you might have. Hope to talk to you soon"
3ynhrq,10,2015-12-29,If Clinton and Trump are in the general it will be tough for Hillary to combat his candid style. Do you think Hillary will be able to tap into the Clinton teflon with Trump's crude attacks?,atomicpete,PoliticalDiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ynhrq/if_clinton_and_trump_are_in_the_general_it_will/,"First of all I don't support Hillary or Trump, but have come to the realization that if nothing changes between now and the primaries they will be the nominees.  I also don't agree with where Trump is taking things, but he is like something that the Clintons have never faced, at least in an election.

As noted in the following article, it looks like Trump may attack Hillary through Bill.  On Monday, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Clinton of having a “terrible record of women abuse” and warned that he would be a liability to her campaign.

http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/28/donald-trump-takes-on-bill-clintons-behavior-toward-women/?_r=0

Over the weekend, Mr. Trump said that that Mrs. Clinton was playing the “woman’s card” and that her husband’s sexual history would be fair game as the 2016 race ramped up. “His presidency was really considered to be very troubled, to put it mildly, because of all of the things that’s she talking to me about,” Mr. Trump said

Mr. Clinton admitted to having an affair with an intern while he was president and rumors that there were other instances of infidelity have swirled around him for years. His political opponents tried unsuccessfully to have him removed from office and the issue has largely receded in the ensuing decades.

But Mr. Trump is going there.

In pursuing this line of attack, Mr. Trump appears to be taking a page from the playbook of his former political adviser Roger Stone. Mr. Stone, a veteran Republican strategist who worked for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, published a book earlier this year titled “The Clintons’ War on Women” in which he accuses Mr. Clinton of being a serial philanderer and a rapist who he compared to the disgraced comedian Bill Cosby.

Although Mr. Stone is no longer officially affiliated with Mr. Trump’s campaign, he has been encouraging the criticism of Mr. Clinton on social media while promoting his book. He accused Mrs. Clinton on Monday of bullying her husband’s sexual assault victims and over the weekend he reposted an old photograph on Twitter of Mr. Clinton and Monica Lewinsky standing together in the White House."

Title: **Something which happened this year, should be resolved by the end of the year**

Jan Ken Pon! Aiko-desho!

Year 2015 is ending in a few days. 

Looking back on this year, Aiko found a fact and was surprised!!

I've been taking plane-ride every single month in this year!

It's my first time to travel by plane this often since I joined Sakura Gakuin.

Or more precisely, I've never taken plane-ride this often in my life. lol

By travelling back and forth between Kagoshima and Tokyo, Aiko has been trying my best to be successful as both a Sakura girl and a middle-schooler. And at the same time, Aiko has kept watching movies -- that's my hobby -- and watched 16!! movies.

The first movie I watched in this year was 'Big Hero 6' and the last one was 'WE ARE Perfume -- WORLD TOUR 3rd DOCUMENT'. I have something to say for every these movies, but it's hard to write all of them. This time, I want to introduce some of them♥

The first movie I want to recommend is 'The Intern' on which my favorite actress Anne Hathaway-san plays the lead. I watched a movie with subtitle for the first time. Honestly, it was tough for my eyes and brain to watch movies while reading subtitle. But...

The movie rapidly attracted me as time proceeds. 

Anne Hathaway plays a successful 'high flying career' woman. She meets an elderly man Robert De Niro and gradually realize the importance of relationship with others, comes to know what is the most precious thing as a human being.

It's very heart-warming story and you'll feel indescribable happy feeling after watching it.

The second movie is 'Heroine Shikkaku'【No longer a Heroine】 Anyway, the leading actress Kiritani Mirei-san is just awesome. Although she is so beautiful and neat, she plays a comedienne perfectly. So, the movie is super fun! I thought I must learn acting from her. It's also fun to see Fukuda Ayano-san plays a role of a high-school girl. An AMUSE KIDS girl Negishi Himena-chan plays a role of Kiritani Mirei-san in her childhood. She is very good at acting, as you can expect in a movie actress.

Aiko want to be better at acting.

The third movie I recommend is, as you expect, 'WE ARE Perfume -- WORLD TOUR 3rd DOCUMENT'.

Daily life of three of Perfume-san, their state in dressingrooms, their behavior at rehearsals, their expression just before shows, and of course videos of shows...there are full of highlight scenes. You can also watch scenic beauties and tourist spots all over the world, and you can feel as if you were travelling together with Perfume-san.

Besides these movies, 'Biri-Gal' and 'Bakuman' -- there appear AMUSE actresses in both movies -- were great♡

Now I've introduced some good movies, but screening of them are done. Please check DVDs or Blu-rays!!

In this year-end, I can go back to Kagoshima earlier than usual. So, I want to enjoy a lot of movies and DVDs to get inspired.

Fukei-sans, please tell me your recommendations!!!

To Fukei-sans; Thank you very much for your supporting me in this year.

I'll try my best in 2016 again, so please keep supporting me.


To Teachers of Sakura Gakuin; At 0:00 a.m. on December the 1st, Dorm members gave me a surprise birthday party. They gave me an icecream-cake and I had it. I apologize for my having sit up late☆ ('Something which happened this year, should be resolved by the end of the year' lol)

3ynr6o,274,2015-12-29,Resources for the list of most bang-for-buck things every intern should know before starting.,ankihelp,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3ynr6o/resources_for_the_list_of_most_bangforbuck_things/,"This is a follow up to [meddit's amazing advice to interns post](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3yinay/list_the_5_most_bangforbuck_things_an_intern/) from yesterday. 

Now that there is a tentative consensus about what interns would most benefit from brushing up on/memorizing prior to the beginning of their internship, I wanted to collect advice, articles, lectures, blogs etc. on each topic. 

**EDIT: Any and all comments, suggestions, pearls, resources would be very much appreciated. I have added what I feel I know something about. Will update accordingly.**

I have modified the list a little bit for clearity - I feel the points should be fairly specific as the original idea was to find *specific* things an intern should brush up on (e.g. management of electrolyte derangements is pretty broad). I will first post the list without any links to resources and then add them with edits. Hopefully, I will have some crowdsourced help from meddit. The list is as follows: 

**1) Fluids. How and when to use them, dosage, timing and other pearls.** 

- [Review of fluids](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakWOfKcCcCZBMlKIJLofiOhp) (not how to use them per se) by Dr. Strong /u/ericstrong

- [Maintenance Intravenous Fluids in Acutely Ill Patients - NEJM](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1412877?rss=mostViewed) Not sure about the relevance. Please comment, may remove. 

- Pretty thorough review of fluid management on [openanesthesia.org](http://www.openanesthesia.org/fluid-management/)

Still hoping for a more practical no frills do-this-then-that-resource. 


**2) Nausea. When to treat, how to treat and at what dose.** 

**3) Standard pn orders: pain killers, sleep aids and antiemetics aka how to reduce nighttime calls from nurses by 25%**

**4) ""Reflex"" antibiotic choice for routine inpatient infections.**

- http://www.bpac.org.nz/Supplement/2013/July/antibiotics-guide.aspx /u/ChristianM and u/ive_been_up_allnight

**5) Initial work-up and treatment of dyspnea.** (more realistic to approach by symptoms as, unfortunately, you first have to diagnose whats wrong. E.g. heart failure, pulmonary edema, embolism, COPD, pneumonia).

**6) Initial work-up and treatment of oliguria/anuria.**

**7) A sensible initial approach to suspected ileus.**

**8) Blood. When, how, why to replace.**

**9) Pain. Optimal management without inducing narcosis.**

- [Managing cancer pain: Frequently asked questions: CCJM](http://www.ccjm.org/index.php?id=107937&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=365585&amp;cHash=bbfa0a0455a459f2d18e792efcec9334)

**10) Potassium. When, why and how to shift or replace.**

- A review on both potassium and sodium disorders by Dr. Strong /u/ericstrong (Not reposted in 12) hyponatremia but applies there as well) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakXVIAapcSEleP4doUdHVtld

**11) Hyponatremia. Most common electrolyte disturbance, commonly mismanaged.**

**12) Resuscitation aka commit the ACLS algorithms to memory.** 

- Current ACLS guidelines. https://www.acls.net/aclsalg.htm

Would love a video series, interactive cases etc. 

**13) Basic EKG interpretation.**

**Whole EKG video courses**

- A [whole free youtube EKG video review course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakXhL1WoDvNPm1cG57pjE0d7) by meddit's own u/ericstrong

- An alternative EKG course that takes you through all the basics. This however has no free version and costs 96$ a year. The quality is amazing. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/user/ECGTeacher/videos) are 6 basic sample videos on youtube. The paid course is available on http://www.ecgteacher.com/

- I have to admit I haven't used this course personally but his free youtube videos are on-point and he seems like a good teacher. Also behind paywall. Free youtube samples are [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/ECGDoc). The full course can be found here https://www.ecgacademy.com.

**EKG video cases**

- Amazing [case-of-the-week emergency medicine EKG videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8mJfzSyRohn4iQqV6Tx9qUW0tkZSQn2) on youtube by Dr. Amal Mattu

-- If you like Dr. Mattu's cases (and you most certainly will) he is still posting every single week on his new site https://ecgweekly.com. It costs 4 starbucks coffees **a year** and is going to save someones life.

**Practice EKGs with answers**

- Watching videos isn't enough, you still have to grind out EKGs to keep your game strong. Visit http://ecgmadesimple.com and http://ecg.bidmc.harvard.edu/maven/mavenmain.asp for this. 

**EKG blogs**

- I recommend signing up for some kind of RSS feed (e.g. https://feedly.com/) and subscribing to the following EKG blogs: 

-- http://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.is (Dr. Smiths ECG blog)

-- http://www.ems12lead.com

-- http://ecg-interpretation.blogspot.is

-- http://jhcedecg.blogspot.is

**EKG resource libraries**

- [Life in the fastlane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ecg-library/) has a nice resource to look up a specific EKG finding, criteria or concept.

- http://www.practicalclinicalskills.com/ekg.aspx /u/collidge

**14) Know when to order ABGs and how to interpret them.** 

- Almost [too detailed video lecture series on ABGs and how to interpret them](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFDCF820E88FC83ED) by Dr. Eric Strong (/u/ericstrong)

- Practice makes perfect. ABG interpretation generator. https://abg.ninja/abg


**Bonus 15) Basic CXR interpretation**

**CXR video lecture course**

- Again, Dr. Eric Strong has an excellent video course for free on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakU6vTUAoUeVhgRzQgaoSnFi)

**Step-by-step guides to basic CXR interpretation**

3yof0z,2,2015-12-29,I [20F] need to fight for us [20M]. I just don't know how. [1+ Year],funfun4every12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3yof0z/i_20f_need_to_fight_for_us_20m_i_just_dont_know/,"Hey Reddit, I'm in desperate need of help.

Before anyone comments, I know people may advise us to just break up. But I stick to my commitments and I love him, I will fight for us. I just need to know how.

Me and my boyfriend Alex have been together since December 2014. We are now in our second year of uni together. We study a demanding, competitive subject. We started off as friends, then hooked up, then got into a serious relationship. Our honeymoon phase was incredible. He's fun, vivacious, intelligent, driven, a wonderful lover, and he means the world to me.

First year of uni was basically a massive vacation where we were basically glued at the hip. Our sex life was incredible. We didn't really run into any problems and if we did it was resolved by the next day. As someone who comes from a string of bad relationships, this was absolutely shocking. I fell in love, hard. I know we're young but I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

But then things started getting rough. We come from the same hometown so we're usually in the same city for breaks.

**April**

We went home for study leave. I knew this would mean we'd see each other less with exams coming up, but it became a stark contrast. I saw him maybe 4 times in the month we were there and this made me really upset. I am 100% in support of prioritising studying first, but it seemed like everything came before me––family, friends, errands. He was really apologetic and would surprise me with little gifts to make up for it (e.g. getting flowers delivered etc). But I occasionally struggle with depression which had really flared up that month (I am in therapy) and I felt that I needed him there, not the gifts. He promised to make it up to me after exams ended and he did, we were back to normal after that. 

**July-August**

Between April and July we were back to being fully 100% in love and devoted to each other. But the same issues that arose in April arose here without the addition of schoolwork. He wanted to see friends from back home, spend time with his family, etc, so we didn't see each other for weeks at a time. I also waited for him to take initiative to see me and he didn't. I wouldn't communicate that I was upset until I was blowing up (not screaming, but definitely emotional). 

This took a serious toll on our relationship and we began fighting. Things were really rocky until he came down with pneumonia and was in hospital for about three weeks. He doesn't like having people around him when he's ill so although I offered to visit he declined. He was literally in and out of various blood tests etc all day. I was racked with worry about him. He regained his health and immediately had to leave on a pre-planned family vacation. While he was on vacation, I got a summer job and our relationship began to pick up speed towards the end of summer because we knew we'd be back at uni soon.

We spent the first two weeks of uni living together because my flat hadn't gotten all its furniture yet. Our relationship steadily improved but wasn't up to the early day level.

**December**

We come to now. This year is our second year of a highly demanding course, and our grades now count for 50% of our final mark. It's very high stress. He's been apologetic about being distant and busy but in his credit he's really taken on a lot of responsibility. I on the other hand was sort of in denial that our fun first year was over and kept putting off work and procrastinating. He got annoyed with this, and I kept promising I would change but never did.

We had our one-year anniversary and by then we were mostly fine. Again, not near the honeymoon level, but relatively stress-free. We've now returned home for the holidays and old issues are rearing their heads again. He's had two concurrent demanding internships and I haven't seen him since we came back in mid-December. 

I went back to therapy and I was shocked at how upset I was about the relationship and realised we needed to have a big big talk. Today we finally had a chance. 

He told me he was now having serious doubts about us in the long term because of these recurring issues. He said I often didn't take initiative to see him and said he wasn't a mind reader; he also said he had been extremely busy with Christmas, his internships, an essay we have due, and revision. We have study leave again in April and he's said if we can't resolve our issues by then we must separate. He also said he's awful with time management (he suffers from ADD but doesn't medicate) so he'll have to spend 2x the time on a task that I would. He's questioned whether we can keep the spark alive seeing each other so infrequently. He doesn't want us to resent each other.

**What now?**
 
He's said he's willing to work on these issues and he loves me, but that we really need to make a drastic change. He's expressed doubts about whether we can actually make these changes.

1. I'm now going back to CBT to work on my attachment issues so I can be less clingy, and also to learn coping strategies to express issues early on before they spiral into massive fights.
2. I am now studying up to 6/7 hours a day. I am fixing my sleep schedule and eating right. I plan on going to the library with him now so I can get work done and spend time with him too. I am applying for internships and being more optimistic.
3. I am going to actively initiate time to hang out and be understanding. We already have a stable date night, but we don't use it when we're in our hometown. I am considering implementing this for easter.
4. I am fighting for this relationship. It hurts me so much he has all these doubts about us. But I will do everything I can, because I don't want anything to fail just because I didn't make enough effort.

Despite these changes I'm making/going to make, I know he's still going to be doubtful. Does reddit have any advice for me? I know he loves me.

**TL;DR: My relationship is falling apart, but I won't let it go for lack of trying.**"

My question is how do I show I have said skills on a resume/cover letter?

Is it written explicitly ? 
Is it implicit shown in other accomplishments, job experience, etc?

3ypbxx,1,2015-12-29,UK Big 4 London vs rest of UK exit opportunities,R3us,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3ypbxx/uk_big_4_london_vs_rest_of_uk_exit_opportunities/,"Hi,

I'm looking into applying for internships (PwC to be exact). My plan itself is to work my socks of during the internship and end up being offered a grad scheme at the end. 

However, my plan after that is to exit the company after 3 years having done the ACCA and move on to something else, maybe CF. When I have asked people opinions on this they are telling me the only way of being successful in doing this is by applying to only the London branches because there is more scope of networking - something that is very important. Furthermore, was told to apply to other London finance schemes over applying Big 4 non London areas. 

I'm not really a fan of living in London in the short run because the costs are just too much for me. My question is does the location in my situation?"
3yphv0,2,2015-12-29,Audio Buzzing on Transitions (PP 2015.1),AkyrXX,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/3yphv0/audio_buzzing_on_transitions_pp_20151/,"Can't figure this one out. I'm trying to mix audio for a bunch of talking head videos and I'm about to throw my computer out the window and start New Years early.

Trying to put transitions on tracks to smooth out edits, but every time I get this horrible buzzing during the transition. Doesn't appear in exports, but it's there in the timeline when editing. Doesn't matter what effect I use, all there. Keyframing audio is not a option.

Workflow is like this: Intern and/or Producer rough cut usable clips from interview in FCP7 -&gt; XML to me for the rest. I feel like the culprit is in the FCP7 -&gt; PPro exchange, but I can't figure out how to fix it. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that there is two stereo tracks, on for left and one for right?

Only thing I can find is a bug from a couple years back. Other than that, I've been SOL on figuring this one out. It's probably something super simple I'm missing.

PPro 2015.1
OSX 10.10.5 on a Trashcan

Edit: Fixed it. Apparently XML import is completely broken right now in 2015.1. Moving to a new sequence with dual mono rather than dual stereo with one channel in each fixes that problem. Also if there is a slug in the sequence, it literally fucks everything up, and if you try to delete it, Premiere crashes instantly. 

Upside to this is I finally convinced our producer to start moving away from FCP7 and learn PPro. So that's cool. "

3ypkmm,7,2015-12-29,What is /r/personalfinance's advice on living very frugally for 5-10 years in a high-income area and using your savings to for a large down payment on a home in a low-income area?,ayolmayo,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ypkmm/what_is_rpersonalfinances_advice_on_living_very/,"I'm in my early 20s, and finishing college soon. Based on my degree, high-income area (Northern Virginia, just off of DC), and factoring in my current internship, I'm estimating my starting salary to be in the $55K-60K mark (considering that's about how much the entry-level employees with my degree in my industry make). Given that a decent 1bed/1bath apartment goes for ~$1250/month and I'll have a hefty ~$45K in loans to pay off after college, I'm definitely going to live at home, live frugally and save up.

I'd like to know the pros and cons when it comes to using your savings to buy your first home in a very cheap area. I understand that both my salary and costs of living would go down, but would this strategy be cost effective? I'd have a very low mortgage and can dedicate even more money to my savings at that point."

3yqb01,2,2015-12-29,21 [M4F] NorCal - Looking to just talk to new people. Cute puppy pictures if you decide to read my post.,TrustMyself88,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/3yqb01/21_m4f_norcal_looking_to_just_talk_to_new_people/,"I kinda suck at this whole meeting and talking to people thing which is why I am probably on this.  I know this isn't really the right place to try to meet new people but I have to start somewhere right?

I recently got out of two back-to-back long term abusive relationships and since then I sorta have been distant and not really been talking to people, more than normally that is.  I don't want to go into detail about it but if you are interested send me a PM I'll tell you the whole story if you really want to know.

Since then I have sort of forgot how to actually talk to people without making it awkward or beyond something that is just small talk or just a reply/answer.  I am still okay with talking with other guys but I do not know how to talk to females at all anymore.  I miss having actual fun enjoyable talks with females like I have had in the past.

Well I guess I need to say a little about me as well? I am 21 years old and I am a full time student in college as well with a part time job. Although most of the money I earn is spent on my puppy.  I plan to graduate by June and then go for an internship for 1-2 years before I apply to graduate school.  

A few of my hobbies/interests:

* **First of all I LOVE my puppy.  Her name is Bella and she is basically my baby.  I love her to death and I will be with her forever.  She is a 4 month old German Shepard/Pit Bull mix.  She is absolutely adorable, but don't let her cuteness fool you.  She is also one of the most destructive living things I have ever seen.  She loves people and will not hesitate to slobber all over your face every second of your life.**

* **I love to watch films, TV shows, anime, or any type of visual entertainment.  I've often been called the ""Critic"" by my friends because of how harshly I judge these films/shows.  I don't really mind because I still find watching anything that is horrendous still enjoyable.  I used to keep up with anime but with today's lack of free time I haven't had time to.**

* **I used to be an avid gamer but with the lack of free time I haven't really had much time to be gaming anymore.  I still play a few games but most of my games now reside on my phone, on a board with lots of pieces, or on many cards.  I still own an Xbox One but it is mainly now my Netflix box.**

* **I love and hate all different kinds of food.  I am usually not picky with the exception of a few particular foods.  I hate pickles and cucumbers and anything of the sort.  I cannot fathom how anyone can stand to eat those things.  I do not like to eat any kind of steak, it just does not taste good to me.  Whenever I tell anybody about this they always just stare at me like I am crazy.  I love to eat nice fancy food if I can, but otherwise my wallet directs me to more affordable options.**

* **I enjoy going to the gym and working out but as of recently I haven't had the time or had a partner to go with me.  I am still fairly new to going to the gym.  I dislike cardio a lot but I am starting to try to get into it, mainly because my puppy loves to run and I need to be able to keep up with her.**

* **I haven't really been a big music listener in the past but I am now trying to get into the music scene, although unsuccessfully.  I enjoy Electronic Dance Music and I plan to go to the upcoming EDC event next year! Woo!!!**

Anyways I'm pretty sure there is a lot more about me that I can ramble on about so if you want to talk more don't hesitate to send me a message.  Just leave your preferred method on contact in your message and I will try to get back to you.  I have most of the popular messaging apps but what I do prefer the most is a plain old text message.  I am just looking to be able to talk to someone anytime of the day especially at the dead of night which is most easily done via texting for me.  Don't let this discourage you from sending me a message if you feel insecure of sending me your phone number as I can understand.  Just message me your most comfortable way of contact and I can most likely accommodate.  [Well enough about me, this is all what you are here for right?](https://imgur.com/gallery/kpECB/new)

Thank you for your time and reading through this entire post and I wish you all happy holidays!

3yqc67,3,2015-12-29,The year is about to end and it's been my worst ever,lonelyguybroke,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/3yqc67/the_year_is_about_to_end_and_its_been_my_worst/,"Hi, thanks for reading!

Well, I've always been a loser but I always worked and three years ago I started to study a new career for the better. I had to work and study, yet living with my parents because in my country it's hard to get away from home unless you have friends or a girlfriend who moves with you to live together.
I left a job early this year for an internship due to my studies, the internship was awful and I couldn't stay there but I didn't think I would never find another chance to get a job during the rest of the year (this happened about 6 months ago). Now, I barely have any money.

Psychologically I feel really bad, I always was a lonely guy but now I don't have a job and no money even to buy cheap stuff, I'm not on drugs or alcohol btw. I'm studying CS but nobody hires a CS student unless he's doing an internship.  I've done well in my studies, including the internship even though it was such a bad company. Last time I checked my account I had like 25 dollars.

My parents are poor and we live with an aunt. The neighborhood is not good (loud music, people who sell drugs, ghettoes) but it's not terrible for our standards because neighbors don't mess with us directly. Yet I wanna leave as fast as possible because it's what I should do but I can't now. 

As you can guess I don't have friends to vent, I have classmates but not real friends. Sometimes I wanna cry but tears won't come up, I haven't had a breakdown ever since although I know I'm at my lowest point. It's as though crying was giving up or plainly wrong.

So, I'm not lazy, yet nothing works well in my ""adult life"" whereas others live by themselves, stressed, with problems but with friends and family, a partner who supports them. I'm at the bottom. If I died I wouldn't be remembered by too many people. Not that I want to die literally, there are some dreams that still put me on the move like travelling in the future when I finish my career (this year if everything goes fine academically). Reading books is the only thing that makes me forget about this shit and fortunately I live in a city where there are lots of libraries around and one of them is at a walkable distance.

Now it's new year's eve and I'm gonna go with my parents to see some relatives. I prefer that to stay in this house that I loathe but if I could afford it I would have gone elsewhere. I won't be able to tell them how worried about my near future I am, it's gonna be a nice dinner with fireworks nearby and that's it. 

I need a shoulder to cry on (and a job or a good internship). Now at least I've put this off my chest. 

If you read this thanks. I hope we have a good 2016.

3yqr0s,1,2015-12-29,He was terrible but I miss him so much. What is wrong with me?,wontgivebackstuff,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/3yqr0s/he_was_terrible_but_i_miss_him_so_much_what_is/,"I had such a rollercoaster ride that when I type it out it all sounds so bizarre to me how things happened. Sorry I just need to vent, and need support right now more than anything. Most of the time I just want to crawl under a rock.

D and I met at a workplace 4 years ago, I was an intern there and after I left from the workplace he pursued me relentlessly. I was very cautious at first because people at the workplace really didn't like him (RED FLAG number 1). But he was so charming, and wonderful to me I fell for him hard. I believe he really did love me, and I believe that we had some marvellous times together.

Half a year into us dating, he lost his job and I've been financially supporting the both of us for almost 3 years as he tried to get a job. The problem is, he's a smart guy but he's the CEO or nothing type. So I've actually relocated countries twice for him now as he tried to pursue different things and I supported him through it all. Last year he tried to do a business in a country he didn't speak the language, and lo and behold, I stupidly relocated and supported him through all of that. When the company failed, we were both really devastated.

He got a job in a different state (yet again) and I wasn't willing to relocate this time so I stayed put and he promised to come back on weekends and work there during the week. After he moved there, he would go radio-silent for most days of the week and he told me it was because he was busy. When I found out it was because he was sleeping with girls and prostitutes I was furious and threw him out of my apartment. That was two months ago.

My family and I supported him through a lot. The whole relationship is bizarre how everything even happened. After I threw him out he sent me a really indignant email blaming me for everything. 

I don't understand why people do this, I don't understand why he would treat people like this. I definitely know that getting back together is NOT an option, especially after all that he's done. But I don't get it and I just really want an apology from him or even acknowledgement what he's done. After I caught him the first thing he said was ""I thought you had someone"".

So here I am, living in a country I relocated to for him not knowing what I'm going to do with my life. I try to tell myself every day that things will get better and that I will come out of this stronger but it's so hard, I don't really trust myself.

Sorry for the rant. It will get better.

He messaged me on boxing day saying Merry Christmas. It's not even Christmas anymore asshole."
3yqz4o,8,2015-12-30,Housing in Ottawa/Carleton - avoiding scams - your advice!!,dontspotmewatchme,CarletonU,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarletonU/comments/3yqz4o/housing_in_ottawacarleton_avoiding_scams_your/,"I want to preface this by saying that I'm not a Carleton student, but I love the area and your guys' gym and will be working nearby so I have been combing through the off-campus housing section.. perhaps this would be a better post for /r/Ottawa, but I thought starting here might be better.

I'm a grad student for Montreal, doing a four month internship in Ottawa, and need to find a place ASAP (like by Saturday) since I realized that I was in contact with this scammer that started pressuring me to send him money last minute.

I was wondering how you can go about looking for housing near Carleton and most importantly - how the hell do you just *know* something is an obvious scam? I moved from BC to Montreal without having visited first and I ordered a title search on the property my apartment was in to check identity and the status of the building and everything was okay - I didn't think I would need to do the same thing for Ottawa, but after this experience I'm really nervous.

The room I found was average priced, address checked out on Google maps and earth view, everything looked okay.. so would you guys have any tips for me in avoiding things like this in the future? 

Lastly, if anyone knows of a place (room) that is up to $500 a month, could you send it my way? (Also, if uh, anyone would like to let a pathetic, starving student sleep on their couch next week I can offer money compensation and cooking skills haha.. ha.. kidding, not really)


Thank you!

I'm starting this marketing internship at this architectural heritage center and need some help preparing. I have very little marketing background and was accepted for the position based on my experience researching domestic architecture and preservation. Are there any books I should read? Blogs? I'm looking for general marketing basics but also more specific stuff related to marketiing museums and non profits through social media. The centers goal is creating awareness and attracting interest in the center. They also do some fundraising stuff which I probably won't be involved in. I was checking out the  "" guerilla marketong "" series but those seemed more profit focused for small business owners.

3yrgql,16,2015-12-30,Holiday realizations from a newly discovered SG,onlydissonance,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3yrgql/holiday_realizations_from_a_newly_discovered_sg/,"Hey everyone, first post on this subreddit, although I've been lurking for awhile.  I just recently came to terms with the fact that my mom does have narcissistic traits, although she is not formally diagnosed with NPD.  I have a couple of questions for you all, but first a story to help you understand where they come from.


For some background, I'm in the process of finishing my bachelors degree, the final component of which is a 6-month internship which I'm 5 months into right now.  I started this internship last January, but had to return home after the first 2 months due to a severe episode of depression and dynamics with my coworkers/supervisors playing out my childhood for a second time.  When I left internship I was not doing well at all, my anxiety was so severe that I was unable to perform my duties without second/third/fourth guessing every move I made.  I spent most of the spring and summer in therapy learning how to deal with everything, then I went back to my internship, and have been doing extremely well and am honestly very proud of my progress, and I feel strongly that I will do well in my chosen field.  


Being back home for Christmas is the first time I've been home since September, and even though I've only been here since Christmas Eve, I feel much more depressed than I've felt over the past 4 months, just since being here.  I can't be with my family for even 30 minutes without something being said or done that causes either my nMom or my nSis to go off.  


For example, earlier today, I come home and I'm looking for a skillet that I usually use to cook with, so I ask nMom and nSis who are sitting in the kitchen, ""Where did the skillet that I go like?""  I mixed up the words go and like.  Haha.  So funny.  nMom and nSis continue to make fun of me for this for the next 20 minutes.  I let it go even though each comment after the first 5 feels like a micro aggression, because at least it's pleasant and they're not being outright awful.  Then, nSis takes a drink of water but the way she does it looks so ridiculous that I make a face, and she says ""What's that face for?"" and I demonstrate what she did to the best of my ability, as a joke, and she immediately starts in on a high class meltdown, saying all I ever think about is making her feel like crap and can't she just drink water without being made fun of for it and I'm a terrible person and going to be a terrible therapist.  She ends this rant by saying ""I'm a good person.  At least I work.""  A comment which I found hilarious in general, because I've been frustrated by the fact that since she graduated last year with her bachelor's degree, she has not even looked for work.  She sits on nMom's couch all day ""writing a book""...however when I walk past she's always playing online poker...hmmmm.  While I am all for writing as an eventual career path, it makes no sense as an initial job choice, because life isn't free as I'm reminded at every turn by my parents.  I've had jobs steadily since I was 16, due to nMom's desire to never have to pay for a thing of mine, with the time period I've been at internship being the only exception because my hours there are unpredictable and often reach 55-60 hours/wk.  nSis has never had a job.  So I ask her, ""You work?"" and she clarifies that she contributes to the household on a regular basis by doing her dishes and cleaning up after herself.  She sounds like a child.  So I say, ""Show me the pay stubs and then we'll talk.""  At which point nMom begins to defend her precious GC baby, saying ""Oh are you working at internship?  You getting paid?""  Which is just a ridiculous argument.  The whole thing was ridiculous.  My family of origin is one who will get in arguments over stupid little things like this.  I can't stand it.  nMom also agreed with nSis at one point during this argument that to be a therapist you should be a good person, and I am not a good person.  According to nMom and nSis, that is.  My family, ladies and gentlemen.


This is such a big frustration for me right now because this in general is how they respond to me as a person.  After doing so much hard work in the earlier part of this year in therapy to put myself back together and really make something of myself, and coming out on the other side so much more vibrant and amazing at what I do (according to not only supervisors evaluations, but patient's statements), to come home to this?  Not ok.  Super invalidating.  It feels like the twilight zone, because who I am and who they're making me out to be just are not congruent.  At all.  


I was reading something online the other day where the author was talking about their life using the metaphor of having built a house.  Basically, they were saying, I've spent my whole life building this house, and now it's finally done and I'm sitting in my big arm chair in front of my fireplace and I'm drinking a hot cocoa and all I want is for someone to walk in the door.  But they won't.  They won't even acknowledge the house.  That resonated with me so much.  I wish I could remember where I read it, because I would link it, but I don't.  But that is totally how I feel right now.  Having come home from this extremely fascinating clinical internship, I have tons of stories that I'd love to share with whoever asked, but what I come home to is not a family who is curious about my life.  I've felt invalidated many times before in my life, but for some reason, this one just takes the cake.

And it started me thinking, all these times they've refused to acknowledge my ""house""...truly makes it harder for me to believe that anyone else will ever want to either.  In a typical romantic relationship sense.  I've started to realize that I just feel like I'm completely incapable of having a healthy one of those.  Ever.  I feel like my family history damages me too much.  Why would anyone want to deal with not only my emotional baggage/issues but also my completely screwed up family?  Not only that, but would I ever trust that anyone actually wanted me including all of that?


It's been a terrible week of terrible thoughts and loneliness and invalidation just like I'm sure it was for most of you.  My questions are basically:


1: How do you deal with explosions like my sister's coming from the N in your life?  These happen all too often and I need to learn how to better deal with them.
2: Have any of you ever had feelings similar to mine about relationships?  Am I alone?  If you're in a successful relationship, how did you overcome these things?  Were they even that big a deal at all?


Any advice or support you could give would be great.  I'm feeling pretty down on myself/this whole situation right now."
3yroki,18,2015-12-30,"My hopeful, positive post-Christianity sex story",laurambp,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/3yroki/my_hopeful_positive_postchristianity_sex_story/,"I wanted to take a moment to share my sex story because I know a lot of us grew up in the ""true love waits"" movement, which has affected our sex lives even after marriage and definitely affects a lot of us as we deconvert. 

I've been making a lot of progress in mine over the past 13 months, and wanted to share in case some of the things that have been helping me can help you. Warning, it's a bit long - there's a TL;DR summary at the bottom. 

Background: grew up Catholic, became evangelical at age 15 in 2002. Was first exposed to ""true love waits"" within the next year. Never officially made the pledge in church because I had to work that day, but made it in my heart. 

Went away to college and stayed pure until after my on-again, off-again boyfriend of 2 years died  from epilepsy at age 20 (we were both going on 21 - it happened in 2008). Was emotional wreck; had lots of sex with multiple partners over the next 1.5-2 years. It was a terrible cycle of desiring sex to feel less lonely on Saturday night, then going to church on Sunday morning with guilt that I enjoyed it and praying for forgiveness. Graduated at 21 (going on 22 in 2009), moved home, and spiritually became a ""born again virgin"" for the next four years at the end of 2009. 

Waited until after marriage at age 26 to have any kind of sex beyond second base. The honeymoon week was awful - sex was incredibly painful and I didn't know why, because it was never painful before. Also, I felt guilty the whole time, because I lived and breathed sexual purity for almost four years (3.5 of those with my now husband) and I felt like I couldn't flip the switch to be a sexual vixen. 

Went to my gynecologist that fall, who told me that I had vaginismus and told me to order dilators to solve the problem and gave me no further advice other than ""this is not uncommon"" and ""it takes time"". Out of the set of 5 dilators, I could only get up to the third one and not go further. It was heartbreaking. I now understood why sex was painful - my vagina wouldn't stretch to fit him comfortably, no matter how turned on I was. 

My husband and I got married in August 2013; stopped attempting intercourse by October 2013. In the meantime, we still engaged in a lot of play, which was critical for intimacy, but I struggled with the idea that I was ""broken"" and assumed it  was punishment for the wild premarital sex I had between ages 20-22. Fortunately, my husband was really supportive and said he didn't marry me for my vagina, and that one day this would resolve somehow. 

I began deconverting in November 2014 and was open to reading a lot of progressive Christian material. At the beginning of February 2015, I started reading a book called ""Damaged Goods"" by Dianne E. Anderson. I found out about it from Rachel Held Evans's blog. It's written from a progressive Christian view and it radically changed my view on sex. She goes into detail about how harmful purity movement is, and goes into a solution for how to change the harmful mindset. She advocates for full comprehensive sex Ed and emphasizes sexual ethics built around respect and consent. If teens are empowered to do what's right for them, which can include abstinence, then we equip them to make the choice to have sex when it makes sense for them and not feel guilty. She also addresses LGBTQ sex and how a pledge at 15 might make sense at that point in life, but with people staying single longer and marrying later, sexual ethics can different for single 30 year olds. This book changed my life. Once I finished it, I felt hope that I wasn't trapped in guilt forever. We attempted intercourse for the first time since October 2013 after I finished the book on Feb 11, 2015. It didn't work, but I felt empowered to make the steps to make it work. 

All of the advice I had gotten previously when I confided in people about my issue was worthless - drink some wine, relax, subscribe to Cosmo for sex tips (thanks, pastor). Even my psychologist thought I was just trying too hard because of my perfectionism OCD. I knew there had to be another answer - so I researched on my own. I discovered through the r/vaginismus subreddit (as well as other online forums) that such a thing called pelvic floor physical therapy existed. I decided I would try it out after I finished the spring semester of school. 

On June 29, the day before my 28th birthday, I went to my first appointment. The physical therapist did an exam and as she expected, my muscles down there were tender and tight. She reassured me that with massage, biofeedback, external stimulation, and gym exercises in the office, with daily dilation at home with the set I already had, with my case I could likely have intercourse in 6-8 weeks. I sobbed in her office I was so happy. This was such a wonderful birthday gift, and the idea that we could have sex around our 2nd wedding anniversary brought me so much joy and hope. 

So it turns out that I somehow subconsciously trained my vagina to clinch down there, and if I broke the habit, that would be half the battle. Also, it's possible that when I fell and sprained my knee in 2010 (during my ""born again virgin"" phase) that I bruised my pelvic muscles in the process and started clinching to relieve the pain and never stopped. It was amazing to me that the problem wasn't ""all in my head"" or a ""punishment from God"" - it was a true physiological problem that I just happened to develop. Funny how if I needed physical therapy in the muscles in my wrist I would have never related it to anything spiritual, but because it was in my vagina I demonized it. This revelation furthered my deconversion. 

I was able to have mostly pain free intercourse with my husband for the first time on our second anniversary, 6 weeks after the beginning of treatment. I was stumped that it was fine on the inside but hurt really bad at the opening, particularly in two muscles there. Nonetheless, this was incredible progress, even if the intercourse wasn't particularly enjoyable for me. 

The physical therapist kept working with those two muscles, but unfortunately, they were not getting better. Conveniently, she had recently purchased a cold laser, and using that helped, but they weren't getting much better. So she referred me to a gynecologist that specializes in pelvic floor issues. I first had the chance to see her in October. She diagnosed me with vulvodynia. At first, we tried non invasive numbing creams, then the removal of skin tags, and now I am getting steroid injections into those two muscles. The progress is slow but steadily working - I've had two injections so far and it's making a difference down there by helping the muscles relax. unfortunately the stress of full time grad school as a second year student while working a part time internship caused me to relapse a bit - we went without intercourse (and I went without dilation) for a month and now I am slightly too small to fit him, but hope to be able to remedy that over the next couple of weeks. 

I have been incredibly open about my journey to family and friends in real life because there's a lot of shame in sexual dysfunction as well as false information floating around. (Heck, even my normal gynecologist admitted at my annual exam in late July 2015 that she didn't know as much as she should about it and was glad I found physical therapy helpful! I hope she takes my advice to push for physical therapy in tandem with dilating for other patients with vaginismus.) My problem turned out to be both mental and most importantly physiological. I know a lot of us struggle with relationships and sex post conversion, so I hope my story at the very least provides comfort that this can and will get better. 

TL;DR: bought into ""true love waits"" as a teen, had sex in my early 20s, became a ""born again virgin"" for 4 years, was unable to have sex after marriage due to being unable to flip the mental switch as well as my husband's penis not fitting in my vagina. Turns out that reading ""Damaged Goods"" by Dianne E. Anderson (a progressive Christian) helped my mental mindset, and getting pelvic floor physical therapy and specialized gynecological care has helped my vaginismus and vulvodynia. "
3yrqr1,5,2015-12-30,I got my revenge on the girl that crushed my idea of love,starts_arguements,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3yrqr1/i_got_my_revenge_on_the_girl_that_crushed_my_idea/,"The story of how I got my revenge on a girl I thought I loved is a long and emotionally exhausting tale. 


I was raised in a conservative household and therefore had unrealistic and fantastical ideals of love and relationships. I genuinely wanted my life to play out like a disney fantasy. 


She was raised in a broken home, shafted from home to home and grew up with deep daddy and mommy emotional issues. I obviously only found this out too late - only after her issues had sucked me in and destroyed me along with her. 


Growing up I idolised her - our interests were similar and the fact I would only see her once or a twice a month depending on which relative she was staying with - made her even more alluring to my young heart. While I was being raised up in a loving home, getting good results, graduating from high school to entering law school - she dropped out of high school and demonstrated typical behaviours of a damaged girl - sleeping around, dating much older men, no career ambitions, financial difficulties etc. 


Obviously, I know all of this now - at the time though, I thought she was just this sweet girl who was dealt an unfortunate hand - I told myself I didn't need to know the details - I would still 'save' her. 


By the age of 22 everything was going great in my life - I was on a good future path. However, one piece was missing. Her. 

I pursued her and eventually ended up in the back seat of a car having our first kiss together. While that was all great, my unrealistic idea of love implored me to seek a sign that she was in fact the 'one', that she was special. Believe it or not, the very next day I am in the city and I walk past her having a coffee with a friend. She sees me and calls me over and all three of us have a great time together. For me, this chance coincidence fucked up my life. I was now convinced she was the girl for me. I had to have her. 

You can imagine the shock and despair that I felt then, when only a week later while on a late night phone call with her - she tells me she doesn't picture herself with me and that she doesn't want to pursue a relationship with me. From my point of view, I was perfect. What was wrong with me for her to reject me! What had I done wrong! What was missing from me as a person! Did I not deserve her love! What about this sign from above! 

To my sheltered and naive existence, this rejection destroyed me to my core. I had never been rejected before, I was always happy and never suffered from depression or anxiety. This rejection changed it all. I suffered a breakdown. I cried for nights on end picturing our lives together and how it could never be. I analysed everything about myself and critiqued every flaw searching for an answer as to why - when I was so sure this was right - this relationship failed. 


Thankfully, I reached out to the right resources and followed the rules. I cut all contact with her. While this saved face with her, I was still hurting inside, privately. I told no one about this experience. I was extremely bitter and angry, not just at her anymore, but at life and love. I started to resent women and without realising it started to passively aggressively react to them negatively. 

It just so happens that about 3 months after cutting contact, I had a planned internship overseas. It was organised through my University and I would be staying at a local families house. This was a fantastic situation to take my mind off of everything that happened and move on. It was to my unbelief (and now, looking back, unfortunate timing) that the family I was staying with had the most beautiful daughter I had ever seen in my life. One look at this woman made me forget about everything else wrong in my life. During my stay we got closer and closer and I learned that she had all the characteristics that I wanted in a partner. She was everything the other girl was not. Unfortunately, my bitterness and suspiciousness of women because of this past experience took a hold of me and I did something to this girl that destroyed any potential relationship I could hope for. 

I blamed the original girl for this failed relationship. If I wasn't so emotionally damaged and crippled by my experience with her, I would have treated the overseas girl differently and maybe developed something - but no - even thousands of miles away - this girl was still ruining my life. It was now time to get my revenge. 
 

Another year past with no contact - when through our social circle we finally met each other on a night out. By this time, I had improved myself considerably. I had addressed what I thought were my flaws to ensure she could never reject me again. That night we kissed again. She seemed so impressed with me now. 

We slowly reconnected and started hanging out more. All the while, I was subtly getting her to fall in love with me. During the years of no contact, I had been in other short term relationships, I had slept with women and started to understand how to get them to click. It was exactly the opposite of what I was taught growing up. Respecting women, appreciating them, giving compliments - none of that worked. You had to be a man. You had to give off the impression that you were with three or four women on the side for them to respect you. I hated everything about this - but it worked. 

I eventually managed to get so close with this girl that she finally let me sleep with her. Immediately after she told me that no other man had ever made her cum that fast. This is the beginning of getting her attached to me emotionally and physically. She opened up to me and started to pour out her past. This is where I began to learn about her troubled past - it shocked me how little I knew of this girl. I had fallen in love with an idea of her - she was nothing like what I had pictured originally. 

The more I learned about her, the more I despised her past. The more I despised her as a worthless person. I felt ashamed I had let someone so weak affect me like she had. She was now in my hands to do with her as I will - and I wanted to make her feel the pain she had made me feel all those years ago. 

As months past, our relationship grew stronger and stronger. I got her to open up to me sexually, making her do things she had refused to do with previous partners. She was now wanting to please me. She was now seeing everything she had missed all those years ago. She was proud of me. 

This all culminated in a conversation where she wanted us to take the next step. During all of this - knowing I had no intention of having a real relationship with her, I had not told any of our friends or family about our relationship. She was now putting pressure on me - wanting to make it official to the world - wanting to tell her parents that we were now serious. Wanting to flaunt me to all her friends. Isn't it funny how things change.  

It was during this conversation that I told her I wanted nothing to do with her. I told her she shouldn't tell anybody about us because there wasn't an 'us'. I left her crying and cut all contact with her. That was over 9 months ago. We have not spoken a word or even seen each other in 9 months now. 

I only bring this story up because we have a mutual friends wedding coming up in the next week, and I am sure we will run into each other. I don't know how either of us will react or what will happen. 

All I know is that I wish I never kissed her in the back of that car.

3ysnio,11,2015-12-30,"Here's my six month story, I'm posting it maybe to help others.",dylang92,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/3ysnio/heres_my_six_month_story_im_posting_it_maybe_to/,"Alright, here we go. Six months ago the girl of my dreams and I broke up. She was going away to a different country indefinitely, and there'd be no way to determine if we'd talk or when we'd see each other. A couple of weeks of arguing we realized we'd break up separated by countries anyway and it'd hurt us both. So we ended it, and wanted to remain friends because we were kind of each other's best friends. Of course next day I decided to say that we could try long distance and she wasn't having it. She was afraid that she couldn't ""immerse"" herself there and would just want to come back as fast as she could. Somehow I understood this, and while I was angry and hurt, I left. I never wanted to do the friends thing with my ex, mostly because I had a feeling it would end bad for me. But something about this seemed different. ""It was mutual, it's not like we broke up because she was done with me."" After about a week I opened the contact again and we were friends. My biggest mistake ever, but I'll get into that. 

For 4 months it was nice to talk to her. I had my friend and could still laugh at the inside jokes. In fact it felt like business as usual, nothing changed. Well except she wasn't my girlfriend, but overall it didn't bother me all that much. But I noticed I wasn't moving on. I wasn't finding interest in other girls, but I couldn't figure it out. Anyway a couple of weeks later i decided to boot up my Tumblr, because ya know for the lels, I was still following her because it had been a long time since I used it. And there it was. Her posts were popping up and all about someone else. Then it all came to me, I was still quite in love with her and her moving on was like a stab to the heart. It really freaking hurt and she didn't have the audacity to even tell me. So here I was, drunk at a basement show and depressed because the love of my life had moved on. The only reason I was friends was to hope that we'd get back together. 

The next day I messaged her. I told her that I no longer wanted to be friends. I said  that I missed her and us and I was still in love with her. I told her I couldn't truly be her friend and I wasn't happy and I wasn't moving on. I didn't blame her for this fact because it wasn't her fault, it was mine. She was pissed at me because it was while she was there and was happy and that I surprised her. Either way she hurried the convo and that was it. I erased all the photos I had. Deleted the messaging app, my tumblr, my Instagram app and blocked her on Facebook. I still looked at her tumblr page a lot because I love being hurt I guess. 

For a couple weeks I was severely depressed. More depressed and self destructive than I had been in the 4 and a half months prior. I was drunk and/or high on something for that time. It finally all built up to being drunk at my friend's house the night before thanksgiving and screaming on the ground about how much I hated her and was hurt. My friend stayed outside with me while I screamed and cried and I got up. I drunkingly messaged her, she read it, didn't respond, and that was it. Probably showed it to people, and laughed. Whatever. 

I still had gifts of hers that she made me in my house. I gave them to my friend to do ""something"" with. No idea what he did with him, we don't talk about it. I had my friends password block all of her pages on my phone. I had a really good web page blocker on chrome and used that for my laptop. No more looking at her social media. 

Anyway another month went by and slowly but surely things were getting better. I started working out again, I started writing again, I started being less of a nuisance again to people. 6 months to the day I found a picture of her in my wallet, I completely missed it. I looked at it, I remembered the fond times and when the picture was taken. I actually smiled when I thought about us, something I hadn't done in months. I decided to do something I guess was a bit crazy, but whatever I didn't have anything to prove anymore. I used to go to her house a lot, no i didn't go to her house. There was a bar in her town that we'd go to a lot. I sat in the same spot I used to with her, but without her, and I had a drink. Then I left and there was trash can, I took the picture I had, the last real tangible piece of our relationship, and I threw it in the garbage. 

Today I feel decently good. Life's looking up and I have some awesome internship interviews coming up. I have my friends still, I have my ever supportive family and of course I have my health. I work out more and sing and do what makes me happy. Perhaps I shouldn't've kept in contact with her because it's obvious it was just a bandaid. I knew that but I did it anyway, we all make mistakes and this was a result of it. I have no idea what the future holds, but if I know one thing is that the last six months have been basically a long list of self destruction and pain. I hope the best for her, I do. But I think I can say that I'm moving on.

What I want you guys and gals to know is that whenever it seems hopeless and sad and that you'll always be sucked into this person. Know this, it's not forever. I thought it was, but things are improving. If you ever have a situation with an ex, whether it be friends or whatever, and you know you don't want to do it, **DON'T**. You'll be much better off and remember that at the end of the day you need to make yourself happy. Find your hobbies, find your happiness and it will be okay for you. And who knows? There's someone better out there and you may meet them some day soon, make sure you're emotionally ready for it, but take your time. It's not a race to find them, just a crazy journey. "

Does this seem like a workload that could be completed aptly in two or three terms? I'm planning on studying 20+ hours a week with a possible job or internship on the side. If I do decide to commit solely to studying, I'm looking at 40+ hours. It goes without saying that I won't be too familiar with a lot of the material in some of the courses and that's what is leaving me hesitant in applying for a job or internship right now; I don't want to bite off more than I can handle.

Any input is appreciated."

3yva80,0,2015-12-30,Reason why I have Opie and Anthony's back,InputAboutEverything,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3yva80/reason_why_i_have_opie_and_anthonys_back/,"I will always defend Opie and Anthony. They are great people who get a bad rap and who are not really understood(even by the most hardcore fans it seems).

So I grew up in Philadelphia, and grew up very poor. The reason why I mention where I am from is because when I visited the studios in 2007, I was looking to attend college in a few months but I had trouble getting college aid. While telling my story to Sam and some interns, it was sort of a joke around the studio how I wasn't going to be able to attend a college -- at least not a respectable one.

Opie and Ant somewhat knew the running joke, and I guess asked questions about me and found out my story. Opie then knew I was from Philly, and I guess took a liking to me because by the end of the day both he and Anthony had set up some payment plan for me to attend college that THEY were paying for.

Growing up I didn't ask for much, or expect much, so I am not afraid to say I started crying right then and there. Opie and Anthony were walking through the halls and saw me crying and told me to fellow them into a room that looked like a closet. Once we got in there, they both were like...cum hair you big fukin babey and suk on our peckas.you thught uz waz gunna go to collage for fre? get sukin poor boi. I must say Anthony was well hung. So this is why I will always stick up for them as they were great people.

I hope I changed at least some minds today, and if not oh well. I know what great guys they are."
3yvdod,5,2015-12-30,"My [21 F] Boyfriend [21 M] of 3 years has been too busy to see me enough, and now wants me to ""handle it myself"" as I'm going through a hard time.",sudburty1285,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3yvdod/my_21_f_boyfriend_21_m_of_3_years_has_been_too/,"About 4 months ago my boyfriend became very busy. We are both in college, He is involved in a lot of clubs, and I am not. I am on a sports team, I have friends I spend time with every week, and I am happy with the amount that I am busy. He, lets call him James, has meetings almost every night and only has time to see me briefly once or twice a week. 

James and I went from seeing each other 3-4 times a week to once or twice. This has caused a lot of problems for us. He loves everything he does, and I would never ask him to quit any of his activities, but I am unhappy with the level that I see him. He is perfectly happy with seeing me less. 

He has to reschedule and cancel dates on me about twice a month. He gets angry whenever I act upset about him canceling, saying that I am not being flexible enough. I used to be okay with the occasional cancel, but not that I barely see him it hurts much more when he cancels. 

On the night of our third anniversary he went out with co-workers from his internship to drink before our big anniversary date. Yes he did have about an hour between work and having to meet me, but going out and drinking, not even changing from what he wore to work or getting ready, coming home just in time to meet me to go out, that doesn't seem cool. I was so upset because I left my internship an hour early that day so that I would have time to do my hair nice and look good for our big date. And he decided to use his time to drink at a bar.

One week my friends I was supposed to hang out with on Friday canceled, and I knew he was free because we had previously talked about hanging out that night before I made plans with friends. I had not seem him all week, so I texted him all excited that we would actually get to see each other. He then told me that he didn't want to see me even though he was free. I was very hurt and upset. We had a big argument. He told me that he doesn't feel sad when he doesn't see me for a while. He then preceded to tell me that he thought I had nothing going on in my life and that I just spend all my time waiting around for him to be free. That hurt a lot. He later apologized, but I still think about it often, and his face as he looked into my eyes and told it to me. 

Right now James and I are at our respective homes for christmas break. I am having a very tough week. We just had to put down my dog two days ago. She was my dog for 16 years, and I am very upset about it. I also am sad that I haven't been able to re-connect with any high school friends while I've been home, so I have basically been alone all break. I tried to talk to him today about how depressed I feel right now. He told me that "" I just want you to handle it yourself"" and then stopped answering my text messages. I feel so hurt because I always go to him for emotional support, and I really need it right now. I just feel like he isn't being there for me. All I asked him for was a phone call. 

We had a lot of fights since he has become so busy. And we have always talked it out and tried to work through it. He has written me two very nice and thoughtful letters about how much he loves me and how much my support means to him. But I still find myself constantly feeling unimportant and second rate in his life. He claims that things will be better next semester, but I don't see how anything will change when he has the exact same busy schedule as last semester. I just don't know what to think anymore. I know I should be flexible to his schedule and understanding that he cant spend time with me because he is busy for legitimate reasons. I also know that I can't always use him as an emotional crutch and that I should be able to handle problems without him. But I keep feeling hurt by him. Am I crazy? Should I not be so emotional about all of this? Or are my concerns legitimate?


**tl;dr**: My boyfriend is too busy for me and not emotionally supporting me. He acts like he isn't doing anything wrong. Am I being overly emotional or are my concerns are legitimate?"

3yvy8h,17,2015-12-31,Feeling frustrated that I can't enjoy myself on my own time because society,nyyankees1237,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/3yvy8h/feeling_frustrated_that_i_cant_enjoy_myself_on_my/,"Hey all, I don't know where else to get out all this frustration so here goes. 

I've been involved with cannabis for the last 3 years or so and it has been an invaluable relationship. It helped me in so many ways: with depression, becoming more creative and falling in love with more hobbies, getting the most out of my friendships, relaxing and rewarding myself after a rough day, etc. 

Well, I'm studying engineering in school and I'm (fingers crossed) just about to land an internship with a local natural gas company. It seems as though my love affair with the plant must come to an end eventually and not by my own choice. With the career I wish to pursue, I know that this upcoming drug test is only the beginning. 

It sucks that people are able to drink a beer or smoke a cigarette at the end of the day (which is completely unhealthy) but I can't vaporize a plant in the comfort of my own home because society has deemed it an evil deed, a dangerous drug that should be feared and that characterizes people with no goals nor ambition to succeed. 

Well fuck man I get good grades, study my ass off with a difficult major, have worked a lot in the past, and I can't even enjoy myself by relaxing a bit with cannabis. FFS my family smokes pot, my friends smoke pot, a ton of people do but just because I want to pursue a particular career path it is something I will probably never be able to do in MY *free time*. 

Drug testing for and the illegal status of marijuana is completely insane. What I want to do on my own time (as long as it doesn't interfere with my ability to do what I have to do) is my business and I should be able to do what I want, especially concerning something as harmless as a bit of weed. 

For people who are in certain careers or fields that prevent them from consuming cannabis due to pre-employment/random drug testing, how do you deal with it? If I had to choose recreational use or my career aspirations I would obviously choose the career but it seems a bit unfair that the two can't coexist.

3yvyl8,6,2015-12-31,Love is complicated. How do I [28F] re-date an old BF [27M]? I'd love some insights. [Long],mscrapants,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3yvyl8/love_is_complicated_how_do_i_28f_redate_an_old_bf/,"Tom and I dated for 2 years. It was a good relationship, and healthy and meaningful to me in a lot of ways; however, we didn't really seem to fall in love. We loved each other deeply and got along really well, but amicably broke up when he got an opportunity to go abroad. 



Tom and I are both uni students. When we first dated, we were together for about 4 months before we moved in together. We shared a room and had roommates the majority of our relationship (which I think says something for our maturity and our dynamic). We moved in together not because our relationship was going in that direction (though we were rarely apart most nights, my place or his all the time gets old) - but because we were broke students. We saved some money by moving in together, but really, it just made our lives easier. We got to share our lives together more completely and it was awesome.



Also, we are both very independent from our families, and so don't have a ""home"" outside of where-ever we live. We both wanted to do a study abroad, and so ideally one person would stay in the room while the other left, and then have a place, at the very least, to crash whenever they returned.



Thats exactly what happened, and we decided to break up when he got the call he was going to Europe. We were kind of rocky a few months before he left (even before finding out), and were pretty much FWB those last 2 months. At this point, we loved each other deeply but I could see it turning more plationic. 



I think it was a good relationship, and it didn't really even end ""badly"", but he acted like a bit of a cocky dickhead in the weeks and months before he left. He was open about his excitement to leave and meet other girls (wtf, don't say that in front of me?!), and we overall just didn't get along in little ways. Sex was a big issue for us soon after we moved in together; he was often too aggressive for me, didn't take my feedback well, and we rarely ever ""clicked"". Basically, he had such a big ego that he wasn't comfortable with me not loving everything he did. I think he blamed our sexual incompatibility on me, and I didn't want to keep fighting him. I'd voice things I did and didn't like, and he rarely took any pointers to heart. It was lousy. It's sensitive and complicated so I hope you get the gist of what i'm trying to say. It was never awful, but it just became less and less frequent - which sucked and made us both cranky, because we both seem to have high sex drives. 



So by the time he left, I was convinced we were not meant to be, and comfortably embraced staying friends and supporting each other once he was gone.



I also embraced my solitude, shook off the relationship, and moved on. I dated a bit and worked on myself, and got pumped about meeting someone better suited.



But of course, we stayed good friends. His ego did not work well for him in France, and he did not get to live out that fantasy of hooking up with hot ladies while abroad. *eyeroll* 
He ended up getting upset/frustrated/ disappointed and then sad, that he couldn't seem to connect with anyone. This lead to a lot of introspection and he grew a lot in the first few months abroad. Our sex issues/ his maturity was by far are biggest and one of the only issues we had; otherwise, he seemed pretty perfect. 



So 4 months after he leaves, I go for a visit him. I've never been abroad and he encouraged me to visit before he had left. He helped me arrange my flights, I stayed with him for the 3 weeks I was out there, and we traveled to a few countries with some other friends during the that time. 



I figured he might want to hook up, and I wasn;t sure what it was going to be like, seeing an ex under these circumstances - but it ended up being pretty amazing.



We had a ton of fun and got along like never before. It was refreshing. As soon as I got in, he took the first opportunity he got to say something really important (the morning after I arrived): he apologized, a lot, for random issues in our past. I wasn't mad and didn't hold a grudge about things, but he felt it was important to explain he realized the error of his ways. I appreciated his words, and he continued to apologize casually throughout the trip - I always said thanks and I appreciate it - but you don't have to keep apologizing. He clearly had been thinking about this a lot and apologized for many little things that I had forgotten about. He had definitely been a jackass at times. :P 
... He was trying to hint towards something more, but I didn't realize at the time. 



About halfway through the trip, we were alone for the first time (travelled with friends the 1st half), in a super romanic beach town, with a nice hotel room. Here, he brought up mistakes from the past again, and reiterated how nice it would be to ""re-connect"". We had been flirting and having fun, but I had brushed it off. He got more serious. He felt really bad for blowing off my needs through our relationship, and really want to do better, to share something better. I was impressed with what he said, we went for it, and it was incredible.



Absolutely earth shattering wonderful. (We both agree this was some of the best of our relationship).



So throughout the trip, he hinted towards getting back together (I brushed it off mostly as flirting?), talked up all the fun we were having, how he felt like he had a new perspective on life, etc. He asked a lot of hypothetical situations about ""us"", and by the end of the trip he spelled it out for me:
He realized how great I was, how much he loved me, and where things had gone wrong. He wanted to get back together, when we returned.



The trouble was: I wasn't sure how I felt about him now.
And I had just started seeing someone back home.
And Tom could be abroad for another 2 months or 12 months (it ended up being 14 months, which was his goal.)



I didn't know what say? This was entirely unexpected prior to leaving for this trip - we stayed in touch and talked every few days and it definitely was not indicative that he had feelings like this. He said he came to this realization ~1 month before I got out there.



So long story short - I told him I loved him and that we should stay in touch, and see what happens. Neither of us wanted a TDR and we agreed we cared about each other a lot. 



I went back home, and casually dated (mostly 1 guy, Jared) for the next year. 



Tom and I stayed in touch, almost daily. We were best friends before he left, and stayed in close contact the whole time he gone. Jared knew 90% of everything: that we chatted almost daily, that he was one of my best friends, and even that Tom had confessed to wanting to get back together (someday). I just didn't tell him any details of my time in Europe with Tom, because I really just didn't know what to make of it. I totally had feelings for him, but he was too far away to do anything about it. I had to live my life. Kind of complicated... Jared and I essentially dated on and off. We got along great but had some weird differences, and I mostly pulled away. I didn't want a serious relationship with Jared without some changes to his lifestyle, and so... I eventually broke things off for good this summer. (Though I felt like a lot was left unsaid.)



I had planned another Euro trip to visit Tom that summer, only this time he would be returning back to the states with me! We met up and travelled Europe and Asia for 2 months before heading home for good.



When we planned this trip, we agreed we would date and ""see how things go - no expectations."" 



But of course, there were expectations. We both wanted to fall in love (finally), and both of us anticipated this to be an unforgettable trip together. We were excited for what could be.



A lot had happened to me in the year since I had seen him last; among a few things, I was in a bad accident. My health was rocky for months (bad back, disc &amp; nerve issues) and my life was flipped upside down. I barely healed up in time to go on this trip, and had been under a lot of stress. Tom knew about all of this, but I left out a lot of the harder moments from our chats; I didn't want our time together to be all about me and all these bad things that kept happening. It would drag him down, drain him, and probably make him not wanna chat with me. I shared things with him, and by all means, I called him crying a few times - but, I was optimistic and tried to sound strong. 


We planned this trip hoping I would feel great by the time summer came, I worked to regain my health, and we agreed we'd make the best of it regardless. He anticipated and was very mindful of my physical needs and limits. 


But he was expecting the girl from last summer. The happy, **healthy**, carefree, sexy girl who blew him away. I was a shell of that person. I thought I would be happier and more excited, but I was drained. His expectations made me feel bad and well, its complicated. We both dated other people for the year we were separate - I was happy to date Tom now and be with him in that moment, but he was eager for me to be declared his girlfriend RIGHT when I got there. That came as a surprise. That started things off on an awkward foot, and while we had an AMAZING time together, we had a lot of hard talks about how I felt he was moving too fast. 



When we got ""home"", the plan was always to have him crash back at our old apt (now totally my apartment, with all his stuff in storage). *He* was hoping to move back in and basically back into a relationship. Its a 2bd place, and we discussed him taking the other room. (We had always had a roommate before, and we both agreed it would be awesome but also necessary to not have a roommate again, if we ever did end up living together.)



Throughout our travels, we discussed our living situation when we got home. I didn't want to say that he could move in, but it seemed likely he would, so long as things progressed that way by the end of the trip. It was a maybe, but probably - lets see how we feel throughout the trip. 



He kept pushing these topics, and it made me feel pressured, and I was honest - I didn't have an answer. Worst case scenario, he would stay there while he found his own place. No problem.



--- So! We got back in September. The morning after we arrive, he asked ""so are we moving back in together then?!"" and I was like "".. umm, ... no? I think it would best if we had more space."" I'd like to think that I was open to discussing things, and it was definitely really hard to actually let him leave. 


He was really hurt that I had him go. I explained he had pressured me throughout the trip to define our relationship, and that I felt I needed more space than this after spending 2 months being inseparable. He felt like I wasn't living up to the promise of ""always being there for him,"" althought he only left once he had found another place (with a great friend. Best end result. ever.) 


So since October when he moved out, things has been totally complicated and weird. 


We are trying to date each other, but we've hurt each other so much recently. He's dated other girls and slept with a mutual friend casually. I've seen Jared a few times (unresolved feelings that are now resolved). Tom moving out was rough for both of us: he was upset and disappointed, but I was also upset that I felt backed into this corner, and felt I was only making the healthiest choice for us. 


I made a mistake, and firmly broke things off with him right after we got back, and before he moved out. I just felt too pressued and worried if we tried to ""work through"" our issues, we'd implode and ever recover. I was so stressed and overwhelmed in life outside of Tom, and didn't want to get into this serious, committed relationship while all of my being seemed compromised. (I am financially ruined from this accident - I afforded the trip because it was a travel internship for me, and Tom actually fronted 90% of the costs in the end.) My emotional health is a wreck, and I just needed a little space. 


Tom wanted to work through it, but I didn't quite feel up to the challenge. Does that make sense? I absolutely loved him, but was not sure about ""us"" still, and didn't want to take the risk of losing him for good - I needed a teeny bit more space, and now a little me time to recollect myself.



We have spent a few weeks not talking, but maybe we still just need more time. 



We started really dating again about 3 weeks ago. My life is still as wacky and stressful as ever, and it clearly drags him down. He doesn't want a girlfriend who is in this state, and I don't want to be someones GF quite yet either. 


But I've gotten some time and space, we've come a long way, had a lot of good talks, and I would love to date him, as best as I can. I feel open and ready now. 


Maybe it's too late though? Because he's not ready to date me. He doesn't know what he wants. We talked (lightly) about getting married and a long term life together. He's reevaluated all of that in the last few months. 


I'm still a little overwhelmed with life and the aftermath (lawsuit) of this accident. We both graduate uni next year, and are in our final semester in school. We are so busy. Life is so crazy. 


We are still best friends, more than ever. We want to be there for one another and we clearly love each other a ton. 


So, advice time: I just want take it really slow. I've never done this before, but we have both changed so much; it's kind of tricky dating you already know so well. I want to be this bright, seductive side of myself, but it can be hard to reconnect after a stress-filled day, and especially after a hard talk with Tom. 


I think it should be low-expectation, there should be a time-frame, and we should be very honest and with open with our feelings. 


How do we go back to dating? How do I handle this crippling fear of love and intimacy with someone who has hurt me? How do I manage his fears and insecurities knowing how badly I've hurt him? 


**TL;DR: Tom and I have a long history, and its mostly filled with love and good times. We want to start again, but we're still sifting through the dust of pains from the past. We have hurt each other pretty equally, but love each other immensely and want to be together. I didn't feel ready at first, and he doesn't feel ready now. How can we do this? Where do we begin? We've distance ourselves, worked on ourselves, and have been taking things lightly and casually right now - easy does it lol. We have got something special and do not want to let each other go or mess this up - what are we doing? How can we make this work?

3yw0a1,2,2015-12-31,Help with upcoming internship interview,squarecompass,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/3yw0a1/help_with_upcoming_internship_interview/,"I'm a non-traditional (25-yr old) student in university studying software engineering, and I have been applying to various internships. I've had two interviews with this one company so far - and despite feeling like I blew the second interview, they've asked me to come in for a face-to-face meeting. I would go to the career center at my university for a mock interview, but they are closed for the holidays until the day before my interview...So, I was hoping to get some advice here.

I have always felt like I do poorly in interviews. I remember showing up to an interview for a temp job at wal-mart in a suit. I over-dressed in a couple of other interviews and eventually realized I should go with something a little more casual yet still dressy - but I digress. I just don't know how to talk about myself. In the last interview, the guy asked me to, then remarked that I was ""very thorough."" I don't know if that was a good thing or if I was too verbose.

Anyway, the recruiter told me to be prepared to talk about my skill set, group projects, extra-curricular projects, and what I want out of the internship. The thing is, I could go on and on about my personal projects and skills - that's easier than talking about myself. However, I'm afraid of coming off as arrogant or starting up a monologue and lose them in a very detailed explanation of my projects. I can't talk about those things *and* monitor social cues. It's too much to process.

Any ideas? One thing I thought of is bringing my laptop and asking if I could demonstrate some of my personal projects. What else could I do to prepare? What do I do when they inevitably ask if I have any questions for them?"

In the past 4 1/2 years the financial advice and expertise you've provided has opened my eyes to a future I couldn't have dreamed of before. I wanted to share my success and offer my story/help to anyone else struggling financially this year. I promise things can and will get better with patience, a little perseverance and of course hard work :)

**My Life Before PF (2011)**

In the interest of keeping things clear and concise... i'll just give you the key bullet points. 

* $20k of Debt (Student Loans - BA in Sociology)
* Unemployed (Lost Social Work Job during the recession) 
* Credit score - Around 350-450? (BoA would not give secured CC to me)
* Broke and on food stamps  
* Only income was selling T-shirts on the street

**Moment of Revelation**

The moment that pushed me to take control of my financial destiny was being denied a secured line of credit and needing to sell my favorite surfboard for rent on the same day. I had never had a credit card before, knew nothing of credit scores and didn't understand why I was denied. I also had no money in the bank and $20 in food stamps for a week of food. 

I realized I needed to understand the financial forces in the world to live the life I dreamed of having. I also realized that those forces were already working against me.  If I didn't learn to make them work for me I realized I would be destined to a life of insecurity, doubt and fear at every unexpected expense. 

I was 27 years old. 

**Creating a Plan**

1. I started reading and learning as much as I could about personal finance, credit, loans, debt, etc.  
2. I discovered /r/personalfinance and immediately posted about my financial situation and asked for advice. 
3. Based on that advice I did the following:
       * Decided to transition careers and started applying for                               internships and entry level positions in new fields. 
       * Requested my free credit report and created a game plan to tackle outstanding debt/negative marks    
       * Organized student loans according to interest rate and created a plan to aggressively highest interest loans and work my way down. 
       * Once I had steady income, resolved to establish an Emergency Fund that would give me a 3-month cushion should I lose my job. 
       * When all of the above was completed...start saving for retirement and building credit

**Step #1**:***Increase Income and Career Potential***

Increasing my income potential and career prospects longterm were of utmost importance to get my finances under control. As such, **I resolved to start from the bottom and work tirelessly develop my skill set.** No matter how much pride/sacrifice it might take... I decided I would find and excel at a new career. I jumped right in and...

* Identified my transferable skills and polished my resume 
* Decided that I wanted to work with startups/companies developing exciting new technology 
* Immediately started applying and interviews. 
* NO JOB WAS ABOVE OR BELOW ME...If it seemed interesting and like I had even a few relevant skills I would apply. 
*  This process was essential in refining my personal pitch and honing in on the positions/areas that interested me the most.
* Not to mention all of the phone interviews/in-person interviews we invaluable training for future job searches 

After a few weeks I was offered an internship and a great company for 20-hours a week at $10 an hour.  All of the other interns were still in college, most couldn't even drink and despite feeling like an OLD ASS MAN at 27... I knew this was a great opportunity and jumped at the offer. 

**Step #2** : ***Work Hard, Move Up***

From the interview my internship it was explicitly stated that no interns would be hired. I decided my new goal would be to change their minds. My performance would convince them to keep me around.  **SO I PROCEEDED TO WORK MY ASS OFF!** By the end of the internship:

* I'd learned more than I could have imagined
* I had two full-time offers on the table from companies I'd applied to over the internship 
* When I told my intern supervisor, he said ""Do not accept another offer... we want you here."" 
* The next day I signed an offer letter at the company I interned with starting at $50k a year. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: 

I've continued working with the same zeal and dedication. As a result, I've been promoted several times and my salary has increased from 50k a year to 100k a year. I believe a strong work ethic can make anything a reality. 

**Step #3** : ***DONT LET MONEY CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE. LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS***

My new salary allowed me to immediately start saving and tackling debt...BUT ONLY BECAUSE I DIDNT SPEND THAT MONEY ELSEWHERE. If I was living on food stamps before... I should be able to keep my expenses low right? 

I continued to live well below my means and put all of my extra money into paying down debt, then saving. **This meant no new cars, no new debt, and no frivolous spending sprees.** I had to keep my eye on the prize even if I wasn't under such intense financial pressure. 

Within 1-year I had:

* Paid off ALL OF MY STUDENT LOANS

* Increased my credit score by over 100 points

* Established an emergency fund of $1000

* Begun utilizing my companies 401k match

* Promoted and given a pay raise   

**Other Essentials**
1. I have found that YOU HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE to increase your income, salary and position. 
 * I initiate salary reviews on a yearly basis with my superiors
 * Jump at the opportunity to take on new responsibilities
 * Being proactive doesn't mean forcing you're way on others
 * I always look for the right and appropriate moments to further my career goals while remaining teachable
 * I NEVER FORGET THAT EVERYONE IS REPLACEABLE and work hard to be an asset to my company 

2. Pay CC off in full every month and don't take on new debt
 * If I want a car... I buy used and wait until I have the cash on hand
 * Same goes for any consumer product 

3. I now MAX OUT ALL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS THAT I CAN
 * 401k
 * ROTH IRA

4. I maintain a liquid emergency fund that will cover EVERYTHING AT MY CURRENT LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE for 6-months  
 * I dont touch it

There is so, so much more I could add... so if you have any questions at all please ask away... I love helping people with this stuff since it the advice I was freely given here literally changed my life. Anyone can do it! I swear! 

Last but not least... THANK YOU ALL AGAIN. If it wasn't for /r/personalfinance I'd still be lost in life!

EDIT: WOW..the skeptics are strong... I didn't immediately respond to comments with questions because i posted this at 2am... then went to bed. I am going to go through today after work and respond to everyones questions one by one.... even if it takes me till 4am.

EDIT #2: I did not win the lotto or inherit any money

EDIT #3: Job progression and salary information ... 

* Assistant Community Manager: $50,000 K
* Community Manager: $66,000 K
* Operations Manager: $80,000 K
* Head of Operations $100,000 K

NEW YEARS EVE EDIT #4: 
I just realized its new years eve so I just wanted to let you all know that I plan on hammering through comments tomorrow afternoon/evening... I have not forgotten about you. You all are my first priority for the new year.

3ywt4n,0,2015-12-31,(CAN) I'm a 20 year old international student in Canada and I want to graduate debt free. How can I do this?,planningforthefuture,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ywt4n/can_im_a_20_year_old_international_student_in/,"I'm an international student in Canada at the University of Waterloo, studying Computer Science. 

My program has 8 study terms, each of them costs $14k (CAD) + 3-4k for living expenses. My parents have paid for the first two terms. 

I'm in the co-op program which means that I have a work term (4-month paid internship) after each study term except for the first and last one. So 8 study terms + 6 work terms which most people do back to back (4 years and 8 months, including summers).

I've had some experience in programming before so I managed to get a good position and got paid 4k/mo. I saved 8k but then I spent 2k for a flight back home and some purchases ($1800 for the flight because I was starting to feel extremely homesick). This term my parents paid 11k and I'll hopefully take care of the rest. 

My parents are by no means super rich, they're just making huge sacrifices because they know that staying in my home country is really bad for my future. They may run out of ways to pay for my education soon due to the messed up situation of my home country and I really need to find ways to pay for my tuition on my own.

Are there any ideas you can suggest?"

I'm the one with the higher income since she just started an internship.
Our problems are basically related the way she perceives our relationship.

I see myself working hard for this family: I found her the internship, I helped with her job the first days (while doing mine). I clean the house and cook when needed.
She does the same, not less.

However, in most of arguments, she doesn't lose chance to label me. For example, I introduce her to Internet/banking security to persuade her to improve her safety measures and labels me paranoid (e.g who is going to mess with your accounts?).
I get frustrated from work and I nag about politics or colleagues  and I get called nagger (now that she has started working is done similar things). 
Finally, I told her I wanted to buy a PS4 (we've restricted budget) and I got called childish because husbands don't play video games (we have no kids) and I should invest my time in gym (currently I'm muscular fat).

I mean it's alright arguing about my fault since I'm not exactly an example of perfection. What I found annoying is being labelled all the time.
I don't feel a fair relationship. And it's like being alone in a courtroom.

Apparently is very difficult for her to understand my perspective since she is convinced that her discussions are for improving our relationship.

What should I do ? Run as fast as I can ?!"

I have a year of experience and I'll be getting my bachelors degree soon. My working environment is great and I don't have any complaints, except for one thing: the work is really hard.

I work on a team that maintains the software for a storage array system. My job is to fix bugs in our codebase. Sometimes it's easy but sometimes it's hard. A lot of my job involves reading through dense, confusing code, and figuring out why it isn't working properly. It's not fun.

So I was wondering, what other kinds of jobs are there that would be easier? I want a job where I can just come in and sit down and do it without trying too hard. I'm tired of having to push myself so hard to focus and get my work done. I guess I could do web development, but I haven't enjoyed the web development I've done in the past because it's really finicky. But maybe that's just cause I'm bad at it. Maybe I could look into network stuff or sysadmin stuff? Although I don't have any experience with that.

Do you guys have any advice?"

Dont get me wrong, I have friends, love to chat with my classmates etc. I even had my first girlfriend this summer(yay!). 


I mean I am quite satisfied. I have picked up a few new hobbies, got nice internship in a well known engineering company and I am propably going to spend few months abroad as an exchange student this year. Doesnt sound bad, does it? 

Another change I made was cutting all meaningless activities. I used to go clubbing ~ every second week, because I hoped to finally meet ""the one"" girl. I dont seek the approval anymore I just do whatever I want. Turns out sometimes I just want to watch my favourite tv series instead of clubbing or hanging out. When I think about it, I feel like I am missing something...

  So its NYE and Im just sitting home with my younger brother and dog - not like its bad or something.


tldr: Feel much less needy but less social too. Does anyone else experience this?"
3yxhkn,0,2015-12-31,Should I take out a student loan for a new computer?,Tomminator95,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3yxhkn/should_i_take_out_a_student_loan_for_a_new/,"I am a 21 year old college student, I'm in my junior year of an engineering degree. I intend to get my masters as well, so I am looking at a good 3.5 years of school still to go.
My current computer is 4 years old and starting to fall apart (cd player cover has fallen off, hinge is getting unstable, ect.), but still runs ok for now. There is no way that it will last all the way through my education, so I will definitely need a new computer at some point.

I have been able to stay out of debt thus far. I have scholarships that have covered my tuition and I live at home in order to avoid paying for housing/rent. I have always had a job while in school, but usually with very few overall hours. After my normal expenses (gas, food, phone bill, ect.) I usually have very little money left over, so I have pretty much no money in savings. I would have to cut a lot of expenses for a long period of time to save enough money for a new computer.

So my question: Is it worth taking out my first (and hopefully only) student loan in order to get a new computer? In engineering I use my computer a lot and I need something relatively powerful to run some of the software I use. I would ideally like to get something like the Surface Book ($1700) or maybe even the Surface Pro 4 ($1300).

TL;DR - I am an engineering student, I need a new computer, I have no debt but also no savings. Is it worth taking out $1500ish in student loans to invest in a good computer?



EDIT: Thanks for the comments, let me clarify one thing: I have looked at building a pc, but I definitely need a laptop more than anything right now. It does me no good to have a powerful computer at home when 90% of the time I use it will be at school. I know building a pc is the best way to get bang for your buck, but its just not what I need right now.
The impression I am getting is that regardless of whether or not I get a student loan to pay for it or get an internship or something, I should be looking for something cheaper. I guess there is no need to get something that nice when something cheaper would do all that I need it to do.
Thanks for the input y'all!

EDIT 2: My school does have labs with computers, but there are computer classes that use those labs during the day so I can't consistently rely on them."

As mentioned earlier, I am currently a tutor for math and science courses as well as SAT and ACT prep. I am also willing to housesit and babysit. I am also a creative person that likes to paint pottery and do other art related projects.

A little about myself.

 I am 22 and going to UH starting in January. I have two engineering internships under my belt with a 3rd coming this summer. The reason why I need extra cash, is because I am a student on the GI BILL. The Winter months are the hardest since you only get paid for when you go to school. I won't be able to renew my benefits of UH until mid January, and not seeing them until late Feb or even March. 

I am a hard worker and punctual. If you have any questions about my work or myself. Please feel free to PM me. I can send a resume if necessary.

der Jahreswechsel ist für und alle der Zeitpunkt, auf das abgelaufene Jahr zurückzublicken, Bilanz zu ziehen, Erfolge zu feiern, und zu versuchen, Fehler zu erkennen und zu beheben. Und wenn ich so zurückblicke, sowohl auf meine Amtszeit als Kanzler als auch auf den MBundestag im Allgemeinen, muss ich sagen, dass meine Bilanz dabei sehr positiv ausfällt. Mein Kabinett und ich haben uns inzwischen gut in die Regierungsgeschäfte eingearbeitet, und blicken zuversichtlich auf den Rest der Legislatur. Wir sind uns bewusst, dass wir große Teile unseres Programms noch nicht bearbeitet haben und viele Fragen noch intern zu verhandeln sind, aber so ich kann versichern, dass uns die Themen nicht ausgehen werden. Besonders glücklich bin ich über die Zukunftsperspektiven in der Außenpolitik, wo wir jetzt durch unserer gute Arbeit im MBundestag in der Lage sind, auch international verstärkt aufzutreten. Nicht nur unser Engagement in der RMUN, sondern auch die Mitarbeit und Abstimmung auf anderen, auch bilateralen Zusammenkünften sehe ich als Zeichen unserer neuen außenpolitischen Rolle. Ich hoffe, dass ich in diesen Fragen auch weiter auf die Unterstützung aller Parteien und meines Kabinetts vertrauen zu können, und auch, dass sich dieses Engagement auch in einer Bereicherung der Arbeit auszahlen wird.

Unser Subreddit sehe ich auf einem guten Weg, auch wenn wir im internationalen Vergleich nicht durch eine besondere Größe beeindrucken, so doch um so mehr durch unsere Stabilität und Qualität, die wirklich ihresgleichen sucht. Natürlich ist weiteres Wachstum begrüßenswert und sogar  notwendig, um neue Aufgaben schultern zu können, aber die Arbeit dieses und des letzten Parlamentes spricht doch für sich. Durch die Hilfe und den Einsatz so vieler Menschen, die mit Spaß, Anspruch, Kreativität und Witz dabei sind, haben wir es geschafft, eine Gemeinschaft und Regeln für diese Gemeinschaft zu schaffen, auf die wir stolz sein können. In diesem Sinne freue ich mich aus ganzem Herzen auf die weitere Zusammenarbeit mit Ihnen und allen weiteren Menschen, die sich uns anschließen wollen, und wünsche ihnen ein gesundes, glückliches und erfolgreiches Jahr 2016.

Ihr Bundeskanzler Quillsandsofas"

The name's Mike. For starters, I'm 21. I'm in the Eastern Time Zone, and I work day shift. I enjoy story-driven roleplay that's heavy on the smut. I like 1 or 2 paragraph-length responses, at least once a day if possible. I'm posting here in hopes that I can find someone interested in one of my prompts. I'm flexible on most if not all of these, and I'm happy to include any kinks that you're into as well. Characters and such are negotiable, just let me know which of them, if any, grab you!

Please put your name, age, and your favorite color in the title of your reply so I know you read the above. 

Kinks: Noncon/Dubcon, Blackmail, Anal, Rough Sex, Light BDSM, Taboo/Forbidden Roles, Sci-fi/Fantasy, Celebrities/Rule34, Bimbofication, Cuckold/Cheating (As a bull) And just about anything else, really. I'm not too picky. I'm dominant, though I've never really explored my submissive side.

Limits: Scat, Extreme Ageplay, Snuff, Excessive Violence, Futa, not too many others.

Without further delay, my prompts:

**Let's talk about your man...**
We both know he doesn't satisfy you anymore. Maybe he's too vanilla, too gentle, or even, well, too small. Who we are, setting, and characters, is up for discussion. Am I your boss? Your coworker? Your friend, or your man's friend? Maybe I'm a stranger that you meet one day. However it happens, you give in to your urges and give yourself to me.

**1985/Stacy's Mom**

Like the songs. You're an older woman (Anything older than me is fine) looking for what she missed out on in life. You're unsure, self-conscious, and a bit skittish. I'm confident, young, and headstrong. I lead you down a path of lust and depravity, letting you relive your teenage fantasies.

*Blackmail*

Blackmail. However you want it. Maybe I'm your coach or teacher and I find some weed or cigarettes in your locker? Perhaps I'm your boss, and you've been messing up at work. Maybe you just need an extra buck, and I'm a rich dick who couldn't care less? However you please, as long as you've got no other choice.

**Naive Model and Sleazy Photographer**

WANTED: Models for a photoshoot!

EXPERIENCE: None Required. I am an established photographer and I will guide you through every step of the process, including helping you set up an online portfolio and page. I will walk you through basic outfits and poses and give you essential guidance and tips to make it in the industry. Who to work with, what names to look for, what brands to wear, how to negotiate for a bid, the works!

WORK: As described above, we will shoot several different outfits in many poses. Glamour, Action, Fun, and anything else we decide on.

PAYMENT: All will be worked out between you and I at our first shoot. Accepting trades, work for photos, etc.

CONTACT: Submit your work history, a photo of yourself, and your measurements and physical description to this Email address. If I think you fit my needs, I'll be in contact with you soon.

DON'T MISS THIS CHANCE TO CATCH YOUR BIG BREAK!

**Kidnapped Celebrity(ies?)**

I'm a shadowy, powerful media mogul. You're a celebrity who's been enjoying too much time in the spotlight lately, and it's time I reminded you of your place. Nonconsent and roughness to be found here. I'd love it if you were capable of playing multiple women. Favorites include: Taylor Swift, Scarlett Johansson, Christina Hendricks, and Jennifer Lawrence.

**Doctors Office**

*All ages to be discussed in PM*. It's your first time at the doctor's by yourself. Why are you here? Maybe your period just came, and your mother is either too busy or too anxious to explain it to you herself. Maybe you're constipated, and your poor parents are at a loss. Maybe it's just a routine checkup, but regardless, this is all new to you.
Tell me about yourself. Why you're in my waiting room today. Ideally, you're innocent, if not completely naive. Describe yourself and list any kinks and limits you might have. Everything is negotiable.

**Xiylux Corporation: Corporate Administrative Assistant**

Position: Corporate Administrative Assistant - Executive Level

Hours: 40 Hours per week. Overtime common. Late nights. Travel required.

Pay: Performance Based. Bonuses available.

Description: Xiylux Corporation is in need of an Administrative Assistant for a Senior Level Executive. Applicants must be professional, discreet, intelligent, and know how to fulfill requests typical of this job. Experience recommended, but not necessary. Will be expected to maintain corporate and personal confidentiality and to sign a Nondisclosure Agreement. Applicants must be hardworking, with a good work ethic. Must take pride in one's position. Must be able to handle large packages and loads during the course of office work. Must be willing and capable to travel and to represent Xiylux Corporation in the company of your assigned executive.

Application: Name, Age, Credentials, Height, Weight, Measurements, Picture.

Followup: If interested, Xiylux Corporation will contact you at our convenience for an in person, oral interview.

Student Internships also available, inquire if interested.

**Ravishing an older woman**

I'm looking for an older woman. I have the fantasy of being really rough, dominant, and degrading with her, fucking her senseless and making her do all sorts of nasty things that she has never done with her husband.

I could play as your son's old high-school bully, come to pick on him one more time, only to find you home instead. I could be the intern at your husband's office, looking to get back at him for the way he treats me at work. You could be my professor, and I'm a student you don't get along with. Maybe I'm a complete stranger who invades your home, or watches you get too drunk at the local bar?

We'll find a set of characters and a scene to play together, I'm sure.

Bonus points for: Busty, thick, curvy women with plump asses. Redheads. ""Good, Christian Housewives"" who haven't been kinky in the bedroom at all, and would be embarrassed by any of the things I make her do. Reluctance. Doggy Style.

**Send me a PM with the prompt you like, and some information, and we'll figure things out!**

I have degrees in the social sciences at both the undergraduate and graduate level. I consider the scientific method to be my trade. I have done data science/ analytics consulting for one high profile NGO, and one smaller operation as well. When it comes to inferential statistical methods etc., and the principles of data, I consider myself an expert.
I have had a difficult time finding permanent full time work in this field (of course many of us have). I do however have a permanent fulltime job in sales/banking/finance that pays OK, but of course it is an extremely challenging job and requires some shitty hours.  
At any rate, I have high functioning autism/ autism spectrum disorder, and my poor social skills have certainly been a barrier for me finding fulfilling employment in a job that matches my education and intellect. With that said, most people won’t assume that I am someone with a disability when talking to me. They will just assume that I am a weird dude that they don’t want to associate with.
About a year ago, the extent of the liability presented by my social skills dawned on me for the first time, and I spent months in reflection trying to map out what I should do that would be my best strategy for finding fulfilling work in the long run.
What I have come up with is that I need to get better with programming languages and the information technology side of things, in order to pursue a career in data science.
I am currently studying programming languages and the principles of computing, non-stop. My intention is to compliment my research/data/analytical skills with programming and computer science skills. 
My theory is, that armed with this knowledge, I can pursue a career as a data scientist/ analyst and circumvent the barrier presented by poor social skills. As soon as I am confident in my ability with C programming and SQL I am going to pursue an unpaid internship if I have to in order to start building a solid reputation etc.
Am I correct in thinking that Data Scientist/ Analyst is a good field for people who are socially awkward? And honestly I’m not the type who is going to do a whole ton of nutty inappropriate shit in the office. But I desperately need an environment where I can be a quiet person who keeps to themselves, and is allowed to sound a bit awkward or odd when I give a presentation to co-workers or discuss some findings with my manager.  
Or perhaps you people out there have some different advice for me? Perhaps I should pursue a different field where social skills are not as imperative, or maybe you think I should invest in improving those skills.

I have degrees in the social sciences at both the undergraduate and graduate level. I consider the scientific method to be my trade. I have done data science/ analytics consulting for one high profile NGO, and one smaller operation as well.
