My company, AetherQuest Solutions, is looking to add either one full-time or two part-time interns (unpaid) to work on our event management platform. We develop the registration platform that drives a number of major conferences and events in the tech space. As an intern, you'll work directly with me, the software architect, at our office in Burlingame. You'll gain experience with the following:

* LAMP application development on a highly available, highly configurable content and data management system built on top of the Zend Framework
* Local development working with MAMP and OS X
* Agile methodologies and workflows
* Issue tracking using Atlassian Jira, a leading enterprise-level issue tracker
* Modern version control using Git
* Practical problem-solving working with a complicated piece of software that has gone through several iterations
* Best practices and design patterns working with object-oriented PHP5
* Front-end development using modern CSS and the jQuery JavaScript framework
* Complex build processes using Phing
* Quality assurance using continuous integration, single-issue testing, and regression testing
* Working in a team to complete various facets of a single major feature
* Possibly even onsite support for some of our local events

You don't have to be a computer science major or have any prior work experience for this position, but it will be a huge help if you know how to build a basic end-to-end site using LAMP technologies. We're really looking for good communicators who are self-motivated. 

If you're interested in this opportunity, send me a private message.

Thanks everyone!"

First off it's not anti-American, it's anti TSA (and a joke)
My friend has had the dream of getting into Husky training, and a couple of months ago he got a place in Alaska, he was incredibly excited about going.
He has used drugs in the past (mostly weed and MDMA) but he didn't have any inclining on continuing that in Alaska.
When preparing for the airport he was thorough about making sure he didn't by mistake take anything with him.
He got to Missouri and was stopped by TSA agents, not liking the looks of him they stopped him and detained him on suspicions about the truth of 'husky training'. They searched him, and then took him to a private room to be questioned, to which he answered....very truthfully (i.e. revealing a history of drug history), they then re-searched him and after when he was putting his gloves back in his pocket a bag of white powder fell out.
Keeping in mind he has already been searched twice (once in England the next in Amsterdam) he claims this was planted, I believe him.
The TSA agents gave him the option of getting the next flight home or getting put in a cell and prosecuted. So he came home.
He has now started his internship over in Sweden and is having an amazing time.

I made this with my rudimentary Photoshop skills, hope it will make someone else smile, maybe even post some of the stuff you've made for your friends using photoshop

fvt2u,1,2011-03-02,Why didn't anybody tell me about this? High school edition,shutitalldown,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fvt2u/why_didnt_anybody_tell_me_about_this_high_school/,"I am about to graduate a prestigious college in may( after a couple parlaying transfers but only a year late) with a 3.9 GPA. I went to a high school that offered over 20 AP classes and made you feel like your high school ranking was a number that would follow you for the rest of your life.

High school is the shittiest thing that ever happened to a lot of people. I was among those people. I always had great grades and high expectations. But my grades, and general well-being, went into sharp decline somewhere in my freshman year and a total nose dive as a senior. After which I experienced an amnesia that I ever had been successful at anything. The only reason I was not a drop out is I was at a public school that was desperately trying to avoid high drop out statistics. 

There are a lot of smart kids that at a certain point fall into an existential pothole when they realize that none of it fucking matters. And the secret they never told you is, it really doesn't.

This is not to say you should drop out, I am so very thankful now that I was able to get that diploma in one go. But ultimately, the experience of knowing what it is like to fuck up, seeing behind the curtain of failure, and then recovering was the most valuable experience of my life. Those that expect a grading criteria in life discover quickly a non-linear and regressive path that is post-college existence. In other words, the same shit high school fuck ups realize when they're 16. And are past by the time they are 20. When you do come out of the self-hating fuck up hole, and for some this takes longer than others but you will get there, you are so much farther ahead then the valedictorian. 

Being really smart is much like being a great athlete. There are those naturally athletic people and those people, most of us reddit, that suck at sports. But anybody, regardless of where they start, can work hard enough to become at the very least a decent athlete. If you feel like you're smart but are not understanding the things they are teaching you, realize it's a skill. Which for some reason they don't tell you. 

Sitting in a classroom or at home for hours staring at words is not natural, and seemingly impossible for an angsty teenager. It takes awhile to learn to sit down, especially if you have ADDish tendencies like almost all of us. You learn when you can finally calm yourself to sit down, your vocabulary comes from looking up *every* word you don't know in the dictionary when reading. And the comprehension of difficult material is experience. Nobody intuits Hegel. 

A lot of it is literally just getting yourself in a mind set where you want to know everything you don't know and looking that shit up. If you retain half of it you're doing better than most. 

And finally, lose the fuck up mentality. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.This takes awhile, and only later did I realize how much of it came from the people I was with.  I would have done great in that class if I had tried but I chose not to. I can't apply for this internship because it's for people with their shit together. Fuck it, if I mess this up that's what I do anyway. 

Another thing, when you stop fucking up and start valuing yourself and doing well, which will happen. **You won't be perfect.** Don't get discouraged by this, though it is the terrifying thing you feel like put you in the hole in the first place.

You need to make peace with first try shittyness. Because the third, fourth, fifth time you write that paper or story, or make a movie, or whatever. You start to see some quality. You start to recognize what will be fucking awesome in 3 or 4 years and you can strive to it. And along the way, you'll write a transcendent paragraph, or make one scene that could've come from your favorite feature. And then eventually, you get there. But you never move forward if you're standing still. Make peace with beginner's shittyness and you're more than halfway there.

**TLDR, High school isn't life. If you screw up in high school, you can and will still succeed at life.**

fwsik,1,2011-03-03,Any advice for a clueless college grad?,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fwsik/any_advice_for_a_clueless_college_grad/,"I'm normally not one for bitching and moaning, but I'm graduating in a couple months and have no idea what I am going to do with my life.  Not even the slightest clue.  I have a very broad major, and only picked it because it was the easiest (communications).  I live and go to school in nyc.  
   I've been bummed lately, because not only do I not know what I want to do in a few months, I don't even know what I wanted in college.  I had a good time at school, but classes weren't all that interesting.  I don't have anything that excites me in my life.  Sure my girlfriend is great and all, but other than that, I don't even really have hobbies.  I try to go to the gym and eat well, spend time with my gf, and do well in school, and that is pretty much my life atm.  People keep telling me to get internships, but I don't even know what type of field I am interested in.  I have no direction, and not even a reason to get up in the morning.
   I'm not depressed at all, I'm just not happy.  I'm bored all the time.  I have great friends and they mean the world to me, and a lot of them have their lives figured out and know what they want to do.  I'm jealous.  I work well when I love what I'm doing, but I'm really bad at pretending to care.  Even though my social life is great, I feel like it only is because I am faking it.  
   Everyone keeps asking me what I want to do or what my plans are after college, and I tell them I have NO IDEA.  
    Has anybody been in this boat?  I can assure you I am not depressed, and the other aspects in my life are good.  There just seems to be a huge void, because I have no purpose, drive, or direction.  I am 21, in great health, workout frequently and eat a stellar diet, don't drink or do drugs. 
Any advice?


TLDR: About to Graduate college.  Absolutely clueless about what I want from life."
fwma5,5,2011-03-03,Am I being paranoid or is she trying to politely let me down?,newinnyc1,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/fwma5/am_i_being_paranoid_or_is_she_trying_to_politely/,"I'm a little confused by this girl I've been dating.  We first made contact when she messaged me on OKCupid about 2 days before I moved up to NYC for a job. (me, 23. her, 21)  After a little bit of back and forth I asked her if she'd like to get a drink and introduce me to the city a bit when I got in and she agreed.  We met up and had a great date, lasted about 3 hours and ended with a kiss in front of her apt.  Went to the museum of natural history with her two days later and then did some more just walking and talking.  This time she had to leave after a few hours because she had a school concert she had to attend with a friend, but she did say she wanted to come hang out back at my place, so at this point it's safe to assume things are going great.

The next week we met up a couple times (once for dinner and once for drinks / to help her with a project for school) and those went pretty well, but I should note that this whole time we didn't do anything more than an innocent kiss on the lips and some arm-around the shoulder/waste walking.  That Friday I asked her if she wanted to hang out, she said she did but didn't have much money and wasn't feeling great, so I suggested she come over to my apartment and watch a movie.  This time I was sure we were going to hook up as we were cuddlig on the couch and flirting a lot, but right as the moment seemed to come, she said she didn't want to kiss me becasue I had the sniffles and she was already getting sick and had a big week of schoolwork ahead of her.  I'm pretty disappointed but I still trust her reasoning because we're having such a good time.  It's getting late and she's a cab ride away from home so I tell her she can sleep over if she wants, and she seemed to seriously consider it, but eventually declined and got a cab and went home at about 2 am.

That was the last time we've seen each other.  On Sunday I asked her how she was feeling and she said she got sick and to give her til Thursday to get over her sickness and get done with her midterm and other work.  The next day I asked her if she wanted to get lunch sometime this week because her school is like 3 blocks from where I work, but she said she couldn't because her internship didn't end until 3. So I suggested we go bowling Thursday night and she agreed.

This is where I start to get a little discouraged.  For the last week and a half up to this point we would text a lot, she would pretty much always text back immediately, shit like that.  Now texts were much more spaced out, and she started showing signs of not wanting to see me.  Tuesday night after I fell asleep, she sent me a text saying she couldn't go bowling anymore.  In the morning I ask her what's up and she gave me a bunch of reasons such as she was still sick and had a bunch of assignments due friday.  I say sorry to hear that and I hope she feels better.  Here's where I'm hoping she'll reschedule because I've learned in the past that usually when girls cancel a date and don't offer a re-schedule it means they're probably blowing you off.  Well she didn't so I caved and asked if she wanted to do anything this weekend then.  She said she can probably hang out saturday, I say cool and leave it at that.  

Last night she texts me and says she wants to hangout Friday instead.  She has a birthday dinner she has to go to on saturday she forgot about so she's not free then anymore.  I agree and then she says ""we can get drinks with Charles!"" who is one of her best friends (I haven't actually met any of her friends up to this point, by the way).  So now it sounds like less of a date and more of her inviting me out to hang out with her and her best guy friend. 

Basically, I can't tell if she's keeping me on the backburner or if she really has been legitimately busy.  I just feel like in the last week all progress toward a relationship has reversed and now I'm being friendzoned.  What should I do?  I'm really not used to this slow of a pace in the beginning of a relationship and I think that alone may be freaking me out.  Tell me I'm being paranoid and way overthinking this, please.

tl;dr: dating new girl, haven't done anything more then give her a peck on the lips in 2 weeks, can't tell if she's legit busy with her rescheduling dates on me or if she's trying to give me a hint to stop asking her out

PS: I should also probably mention that this past weekend I ran into a girl from high school up here (which is crazy because I'm from Florida) and she seems really into me.  We've hung out a few times and I like her but I also like this other girl. So that could be contributing to my worries as well.  I don't really know what to do :/


edit: she dumped me tonight..good timing"
fwbrm,1,2011-03-03,Vindication in the Texas House of Representatives ,AcumeNTX,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fwbrm/vindication_in_the_texas_house_of_representatives/,"Today, 3/2/2011, was finally a damn good day... Oh don't they come so few and far in between.  But when they do, it's certainly nice when it's sunny and 70, as well...

Like hundreds of other potential and well-qualified applicants, it was scorched-earth, pavement pounding at the Texas State Capitol during the weeks prior to the beginning of the legislative session for potential jobs.  Qualified potential staffers ranged from student interns looking for credit hours, to recent conquerors of the Texas State BAR. As I sat somewhere in the middle with a Bachelor's Degree in Government from The University of Texas, I need not say competition was fierce... and abundant.

Actually, I had garnered great relationships with many people at the Capitol, mainly because my fiancee has worked there for almost 6 years.  As they say, it's who you know... however, it's also always about timing.  The Texas House of Representatives saw one of it's biggest incoming freshman classes in almost half a century, mostly Republicans, obviously.  Therefore, chances of finding a spot on some new Rep's staff was potentially better than normal.  Not many know the Texas Capitol is actually bigger than the nation's Capitol in DC; I mention this not to condone the typical Texas euphemism, but to elicit the slightest bit of sympathy in identifying with a man who dropped off nearly 200 resumes, in person, to any office door that wasn't locked.  I don't like having to resole my boots while having no income...

Through miles walked down those granite hallways (beautiful as they are), you get recommendations from people... ""Hey, I think this person's office might have an opening."" So, on to the next office.  And where do I happen to end up, but Rep. Byron Cook's office.  He isn't a new Rep, and in fact was made chairman of State Affairs, a very important position dealing with critical issues.  On a Friday morning, I find myself interviewing with Toni Barcellona (female), Rep.  Cook's Chief of Staff.  Within minutes, the interview was over, I walked out of the office and actually worked the rest of the day.  Took a lunch break, and everything!  First ""lunch break"" I'd had in quite some time.  So who could refuse a deal like that?!  That was my ""foot in the door,"" and with a military background, solid resume and references, and a decent sense of humor to boot, I had never been fired from a job; surely with my work ethic, resources, and knowledge, I'd succeed at this job, get my career started, marry my girlfriend (now fiancee)... start working toward a great life in Austin.  So, I was happy.

I began mainly doing clerical work around the office- calendars needed mailing, envelopes needed stuffing, boxing needing packing for the move to the new office.  Perfect!  Can't screw this up... I'm in.  I finish everything they had for me in 3 days, and in fact was sent home early on the last day because there was nothing left to do.  As I walk in the morning of the 4th day, I sit down with Toni Barcellona at a small table in the main office area.  Now I am a man rarely caught off guard, or at least I'm able to maintain my wits the majority of the time, and I place great value on logic and common sense.  By the end of our 45 minute conversation, I had lost my job and been told it was clear I couldn't handle stress, whatsoever, all the while still sitting in the main office in front of the rest of the staffers.  Now 1) it was the most unprofessional display I'd ever seen, let alone been involved, and 2) you simply don't tell a former servicemember they can't handle stress... that makes us very angry.  If it had been a prior-service female in my place, I have no doubt Toni would've been on the floor.  I withheld my anger for a little while, wrote down my address so they could mail my 3-day paycheck, and walked out of the office.  My girlfriend drove me home, and then left abruptly as I attempted to soften out granite counter tops with my fists.  So, I was mad...

Now I do not write this to simply slam an crazy woman who likes to play games with peoples' jobs and lives.  I'm writing about a glorious case of vindication.  There are only so many people that can piss you off in a way unlike any others, be it your significant other, husband, wife... Toni Barcellona was riding awfully close to #1 on my shit list.  But, of course there was nothing I could do.  I still needed a job, and hopefully I could manage to get an interview at another office.  Upon witnessing the career sodomy performed on me, a friend at the Capitol called and almost immediately got me a job, which I still have today and love.  It honestly took me awhile to get over my complete hatred of Toni... but I did.

There are many more details to the 45 minute conversation, but I think proof and sweet vindication are more noteworthy.  After my stint in the office, another man was hired, then fired a couple weeks later.  Subsequently, he was hired to work a committee on a senator's staff, and has done great work.  But most recently was the sweetest news I'd heard in awhile.

Toni recently hired a woman to be the office's General Counsel; she's 40 with a law degree, LLM and MBA.  She's qualified.  She lasted 1 day.  This was a woman hired to work the all-important State Affairs committee, but Toni let it be know that she wanted to not only be the Chief of Staff, but the Committee Clerk, as well. For those not in the ""know,"" let's just say that no offices in the Capitol do that.  It's too much for one person, period.  This poor woman left for a brief moment to go pick up her badge from Human Resources, and came back to Toni telling her to go home, because she never gave her permission to leave.  

This is three qualified people within 2 months, thinking they're going to be making a living, then right back in to the job search.  Well some call it karma, but I'm just a fan when purely bad people get bit in the ass.  

One of the bills this session that got put on ""emergency"" status was the Sonogram Bill, a highly controversial bill regarding certain patient/doctor responsibilities when considering an abortion.  Needless to say, much attention was going toward this bill, and no one was enjoying it more than Toni, since she was the head clerk of the State Affairs committee, which handles this bill.  Well, she was enjoying it until today...

In short, the bill came out of committee and onto the House floor for discussion, but because of some questionable tactics used in taking witnesses' testimonies, a point-of-order was called and the bill was shot back down to committee.  This is a bill declared an ""emergency item"" by Governor Rick Perry, because he wants it passed through, like all the other Republicans... like her boss, Rep. Byron Cook!  But because she chose to take testimony before the bill was actually ""laid out,"" they now have to start all over on the bill, which throws off the entire legislature.  Accident?  Well, ask anyone who's met her, and they'll tell you how Toni has bragged about being a lobbyists for 23 years, then becoming a State Rep's Chief of Staff.  Again, for those not in the ""know,"" that's the OPPOSITE way it's supposed to go.  I'm sure there will be more stories tomorrow, but here's an example:

http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/03/rules-and-the-delayed-debate-o.html

Remember that woman hired to be General Counsel and work the State Affairs Committee?  I bet if she had been around, Rep. Cook and his office wouldn't look so foolish right now.  And this time, there's no one else to blame it on.

Ahhh... sweet, sweet vindication. And on Texas Independence Day, too!  So, I am happy, again."

fx8wr,5,2011-03-04,I finish my software engineering degree in April. I may have to move from Montreal to Ottawa/Gatineau after that. How is the software industry there? Are there good opportunities?,Fondateur0426,ottawa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/fx8wr/i_finish_my_software_engineering_degree_in_april/,"**TLDR: ** girlfriend will probably get a job in Ottawa in April/May, and we'll move there. I finish my coop software engineering degree in April: how is the job marked in software development in Ottawa/Gatineau at the moment?

Hi,

I'm currently finishing my software engineering degree at ÉTS, in Montréal, and I'll be graduating in April. I should then pass the test to become a junior engineer in Quebec.

While I'm currently working part-time at a mobile marketing company (doing Java development), I haven't really decided on what I want to do after I get my degree.

Here comes the interesting part. My girlfriend, who's a translator, got an offer from the translation bureau in Ottawa, where she did an internship a year and a half ago. Being the government, the benefits/perks that are offered for a job like that are really great. Nothing has been confirmed, however, but it is highly probable that if everything works out fine, she'll quit her current job and move there (or in Gatineau) in April/May. Of course, if she does that, I'll move there too (we've been together 6 1/2 and are thinking about founding a family).

What I want to know is how good the job market is for software engineering graduates. I'm not in the process of seeking employment right now, but I'd like to know how the market is should I really have to find a job in Ottawa. My degree was a coop one, and I did some internships when I was in CEGEP (Quebec's version of ""community colleges"") too, so I have a total of 5 internships (roughly two years of experience) under my belt.

We would probably be living in Gatineau, but if I start looking for jobs, I'd probably look both in Gatineau and Ottawa.

I did some preliminary research online, both on this subreddit and on Google, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of resources to get me started. Monster.ca seem to a few interesting job listings, but I don't want to dig further until my degree is completed.

Montréal has a thriving tech industry, but I don't know about Ottawa. I know the federal government is one of the biggest employers there, but the recruitement process seems to be quite long. Are there any other big organizations?

How about small companies. In Montréal, there are a lot of small companies specialized in software development. Is it the case with Ottawa?

Job-wise, what should be my first move if we move there.

As I said earlier, nothing as been confirmed right now. The translation bureau's hiring process starts in April, but since my girlfriend already worked there, and got a recommendation from her previous supervisor, there's a high probability that she'll get hired.

Thanks for your advice!"

But most recently was the sweetest news I'd heard in awhile.

Toni recently hired a woman to be the office's General Counsel; she's 40 with a law degree, LLM and MBA. She's qualified. She lasted 1 day. This was a woman hired to work the all-important State Affairs committee, but Toni let it be know that she wanted to not only be the Chief of Staff, but the Committee Clerk, as well. For those not in the ""know,"" let's just say that no offices in the Capitol do that. It's too much for one person, period. This poor woman left for a brief moment to go pick up her badge from Human Resources, and came back to Toni telling her to go home, because she never gave her permission to leave.

This is three qualified people within 2 months, thinking they're going to be making a living, then right back in to the job search. Well some call it karma, but I'm just a fan when purely bad people get bit in the ass.

One of the bills this session that got put on ""emergency"" status was the Sonogram Bill, a highly controversial bill regarding certain patient/doctor responsibilities when considering an abortion. Needless to say, much attention was going toward this bill, and no one was enjoying it more than Toni, since she was the head clerk of the State Affairs committee, which handles this bill. Well, she was enjoying it until today...

In short, the bill came out of committee and onto the House floor for discussion, but because of some questionable tactics used in taking witnesses' testimonies, a point-of-order was called and the bill was shot back down to committee. This is a bill declared an ""emergency item"" by Governor Rick Perry, because he wants it passed through, like all the other Republicans... like her boss, Rep. Byron Cook! But because she chose to take testimony before the bill was actually ""laid out,"" they now have to start all over on the bill, which throws off the entire legislature. Accident? Well, ask anyone who's met her, and they'll tell you how Toni has bragged about being a lobbyists for 23 years, then becoming a State Rep's Chief of Staff. Again, for those not in the ""know,"" that's the OPPOSITE way it's supposed to go. I'm sure there will be more stories tomorrow, but here's an example:

http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/03/rules-and-the-delayed-debate-o.html

Remember that woman hired to be General Counsel and work the State Affairs Committee? I bet if she had been around, Rep. Cook and his office wouldn't look so foolish right now. And this time, there's no one else to blame it on.

Ahhh... sweet, sweet vindication. And on Texas Independence Day, too! So, I am happy, again.

fy3ip,0,2011-03-05,IAmA (soon to be) college graduate with a $130k job that I got without networking. AMA,jjmeasure,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fy3ip/iama_soon_to_be_college_graduate_with_a_130k_job/,"Recently, I've seen a real sense of despair when it comes to the job market in the US -- to be fair, this is entirely legitimate, and I don't want to downplay how shitty the unemployment situation here is. Being what I think is an outlier in the current job market lead me to posting this AMA. Unfortunately, just to avoid any chance of my identity being revealed, I decided to make this post with a throwaway account.

I'm not really sure what I should say before I ask for questions, but I figured I'd give some background. I am from Alabama originally, going to a top five university (let's say, one of {Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Yale}). I am a Math major, although I have taken as many CS classes as I have Math and basically consider myself a CS major at heart, as well (though I will only graduate with a CS minor). 

I will be working in the proprietary trading industry -- think high-frequency trading. Before my junior year, I had no intention of working in this field; in fact, until late my sophomore year, I was originally planning on getting a PhD or possibly working in the tech/startup industry. It was my junior year that I applied to one of these firms on a whim, and was lucky enough to receive an offer from them for a summer internship. It ended up paying (significantly) more than my other offer (which was just a programming job), so I decided to go with that instead. After working there, I realized that both the pay was greater and the material seemed more interesting, so when senior year came I focused primarily on trying to get a job in prop trading instead. I had no prior exposure to the industry before that summer, and I didn't use any contacts from that job last summer to get my current offer (other than having the name of the firm on my resume, of course), so I think I can safely say I got the current job without networking. 

I'd be happy to answer any questions about the interview process, as well -- all of them were very, very technical, and few (if any) behavioral, or ""fit"", questions were asked. I also applied to some tech companies (Google, MS, Palantir), so I can answer questions about those as well, which had somewhat similar interview processes. Many of the questions I got asked were very interesting, and I'd be happy to talk about any of them. Moreover, I think my interview experiences were fairly unique -- for example, I think the most formal thing I ever wore to an interview was jeans, a polo, and some Pumas shoes. 

Anyways, I'm rambling. Ask away!"

my (M27) long-term relationship is not doing so well - my girlfriend (F26) of three and a half years says see she sees us without future and that she does not love me anymore (which, I guess, is in itself enough in a sense). Yet things have not yet collapsed completely and she seems just as loving and tender as ever.

We have been together since fall 2007, when we were both students (we've both graduated with masters since, I'm working on my PhD now), and have had an extremely loving relationship, for the most part. We've had our issues - mostly. She was a student of social sciences, and did an exchange, an internship and then an another short term (three months) job in southern Africa, from which she recently returned. On the first occasion she went alone and cheated on me, twice, but I forgave her, and it hasn't been an issue since.

On the other hand we've had other issues, which have been more significant. They have been mostly about what I've done, and to be honest she has been rather upset several times - we've been on the brink before, though I've been break-up angry at her too.  She demanded that we go see a therapist, which I refused on the grounds that it's pointless and thinking that we could solve our issues on our own. What actually happened was that while I expected that we would talk about them they got brushed aside by all the happiness we had, at least to a certain extent.

As I mentioned, she went to and came back from Africa. Our communication really suffered while she was there. During her first trip we communicated excellently, during the second I was there with her. And last November I set up a WoW account and other things we could do to stay in touch. Unfortunately she didn't seem so eager to talk, and stood me up a couple of times among other things. I got upset too, and we spoke maybe just 5-6 times in the whole of December. In early January we started speaking again, and sort of mended our relationship, agreeing that the plans we had for when she came back were still going through.

We kept in touch pretty well for a while, then less, and had to have the same talk again in early February, ending up with the same results. Then came the week when she was supposed to come back. She sends me an SMS saying that her coming back has been postponed for a week. Ok, I think, I can wait. Then she actually comes back, and a bit later ends up telling me that despite all what she's said, we're actually done for - that she cares for me, but has been thinking on her own, and that the problems we didn't discuss before are just too big. Most importantly, she refused to really talk them through anymore, despite me really insisting.

We obviously discuss things quite a bit, and finally she agrees that we will look at how things go for a month - that if things are somehow good (I wish I knew how) at that stage, we will go to therapy and try to fix the problems. Before that, we would try to talk about them on our own.

As further ""clarification"" of the situation - besides the fact that we have this crisis almost everything is as normal. We've fucked just as much as we would have if she'd come back ""normally"" from a 3-month trip, been to the movies, had dinner etc. Heck, we've even got a nice day trip to a nearby city planned for tomorrow. 

And that leaves me at a loss of what to think and do. Reddit, do you think we are doomed, as she says? To be honest I find her signals rather mixed. If not, can I do something more than I already am by being as loving as I can?

Edit: I've sent her the link to this discussion - please keep that in mind when replying."

fzcky,4,2011-03-07,Today I rejected Christianity.  This is my story.,genobeam,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/fzcky/today_i_rejected_christianity_this_is_my_story/,"IN THE BEGINNING

Since birth I was predetermined to become a Christian.  There was no choice for me.  Raised by Christian parents, church every sunday, heavily involved in my youth group.  I was pulled out of public school in grade 4 to be homeschooled, eventually I went back to public high school.  I enrolled in a Christan college even though I had a better offer elsewhere, just because I wanted a nurturing environment to grow in my faith.  I started an internship with my church the summer after my senior year, teaching middle/high school youth about how to be a good person, how to stay away from sin, how to respect your parents, etc.  I taught group lessons and mentored kids one on one. I was a devout and content Christian.

SEEDS OF DOUBT

The first year of college is when my perfect Christian reality began to cave in on itself.  My parents had been at eachothers throats since I could remember and a seperation was imminent.  No parent should put their child in the middle of a marital argument, but as many of you can relate I was often asked on whose side I stood.  When my father left I became very cynical.  I decided that I would never be able to maintain a marriage because I would naturally develop the characteristics of my parents.  While I was a confident, funny, outgoing person in high school, I became insecure and isolated.  

I put on a mask.  I convinced myself that I was fine.  I made friends.  I was social.  But there was a void deep inside of me, growing every day.  

Maybe it was because I knew, KNEW, that no relationship I ever had would last.  Maybe it was that I felt like I had to pretend to be more religious than I was to fit in.  Where once I felt like a confident Christian leader, now I wasn't Christian enough to feel accepted.  I didnt' have the Christian resume, the pedigree, of some other students.  

Many students at this college had been homeschooled for life, or private schooled.  They had never heard any message besides the Bible.  They didn't understand that maybe, just MAYBE, there are alternatives.  Christians are taught from a very young age that the Bible is the only way, if you reject it you're going to get tortured forever.  This is a very effective way to brainwash young people!  

WORLDLY EXPERIENCES

When I turned 21 I became an average college student, i.e.  I went to the bars on weekends.  You would not believe the amouth of scorn and judgement I received.  Why do Christians have such a hard time grasping the ""water into wine"" parable??  I was not an alcoholic, I just wanted to have some semblance of a normal college experience.

Needless to say I am very glad I got out of there.  I had zero relationships in college, in fact I went all those years without a single kiss.  WTF kind of college experience is that.  

BACK TO REALITY

Summer after college I feel great.  I'm out of the bubble ready to start living my own life.  90% of my college friends get married and are doing their own thing now.  I wish them all well.  I get to second base with three girls that summer.  Christian colleges are not a good place to pick up chicks.

JOB TROUBLES

At this point I'm a college graduate with no job.  The job market is shit so I'm applying to a ton of places (as an engineer).  To all of you who are in this place my heart goes out to you.  It sucks way more than you get credit for.  I get a crappy minimum wage job.  

Needless to say I'm stuck at home.  Living at home when you're in your 20's is not glamorous but lots of people are stuck in that situation.  No shame.  But what does suck is being treated like you're back in high school.  All of a sudden you have someone who wants to know where you've been, what you're doing, 24/7.  I was again being judged for not going to church, but now its worse.  All of a sudden its not about feeling accepted/rejected.  Now the woman who brought you up is telling you that you're a bad person.  The person you most need love and encouragement from is picking out all the areas that you are inadequate.  ""you're just like your father"" is commonly thrown around like it was nothing.  That shit cuts.  Deep. 

ON MY OWN

FUCKING finally I got an engineering job.  I immediately move out.  I want to learn if I really am inadequate.  Do I have what it takes to be a man.  Can I make it on my own??  These are huge questions.  Let me just tell you doubters out there.  YOU CAN MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN.  No matter what anybody fucking has you believing, YOU ARE A FUCKING MAN.  Living on my own taught me this.  I am self reliant.  I am interesting.  I have quality.  Manly fucking quality. 

Lets fastforward to my conversion:

This story may have been a little vague on this point but let me make it very clear.  My mother was the driving force in my life for a long time.  She is fucking strong willed as shit.  She is an alpha woman.  

I had been really starting to question why I was a Christian now.  The whole self reliance thing really contradicts the ""you need Jesus"" message.  So I began having a series of debates (not angry debates, just discussions) with my mother about some points in the Bible that seemed the most questionable.  For example my mother believes in a literal creation and no evolution.  So without using science I try to tell her why she should believe in evolution.  At first I'm trying to tell her how it fits in a figurative translation of Genesis but then I think, WTF heres a point: ""If Noah's arc was x cubits by y cubits by z cubits, and we have millions of species of animals today, how the fuck did they all get on the damn arc?? Theres not enough fucking room!""  

She tells me to ask somebody else.  WHAT???  If this book is the most important thing in your life, then you better fucking care about this kind of shit!!!  We had a couple more arguments that ended this way, about gay marriage, speaking in tongues, etc.  Last week when I was leaving after the gay marriage argument she jokingly said to my sister ""Geno has no values"".  I laughed it the fuck off because this was exactly what I needed to push me to the other side. 

MY CONVERSION

No values??  Because I think gay people should be able to get married?  Because I take the time to think about how scientific evidence fits into the framework of the Bible?  Because I dont go to church?  

Over the past week I've been on reddit a lot (particularly seddit), and I am for the first time in my life feeling really confident about myself.  I believe I have an intrinsic value just for being a human.  I've been going out meeting everyone I can.  I've become so outgoing and what have i learned?  EVERY HUMAN HAS VALUE.  But wait don't Christians believe that?  

Christians belive that God, creator and sustainer of the universe, breathed life into us, loves us, and is going to send most of us to hell.  FOREVER.  FUCK THAT SHIT.  Today I released myself from the shackles of Christianity.

WHAT I LEARNED

DONT LET **ANYONE** TELL **YOU** WHO **YOU** ARE.  
Who you are is not what you look like.  It's not what color you are, how old you are, or what the fuck anyone else thinks about you.
Maybe you are a piece of shit.  But no one really knows except you. You can be whoever you want to be.  Dont let anyone define you except for yourself. 

BELIEVE IN YOURSELF

**THINGS THE BIBLE GOT RIGHT**

FORGIVE
everyone makes mistakes, everyone does shitty shit.  It takes a big person to forgive.

LOVE
The world is fucking beautiful.  SO ARE YOU.  Love yourself.  Love your neighbors.  Love nature.  Love life.  FUCK it is awesome to be ALIVE!

**THINGS THE BIBLE GOT WRONG**

""The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom"".  History is a good indicator that discoveries are made when people have the courage to challenge accepted ideas.  Fear has never brought about new ideas.  Christians are taught not to challenge, to blindly follow.  DONT EVER FOLLOW ANYTHING BLINDLY.  I'm looking at you reddit.  Dont be afraid to make spelling mistakes, listen to Nickelback, go to digg, vote for Sarah Palin, be a Christian.  But make sure you know why you're doing it, and let the reason be that you're doing it for yourself.  I'm not saying to be selfish.  In fact I think that being selfless (volunteering, helping old people, putting others above yourself) is the BEST thing you can do FOR YOURSELF.  

The whole Noah thing.  WTF?  Also Jonah?  maybe...


Hell.  
I wrote a paper in college about hell.  The Bible has many descriptions of it.  Is it eternal seperation from God?  Is it a firey pit?  Will we be there for eternity?  Will God rescue us from it eventually?  It says all these things.  (well it says that God will rescue all the jews from hell at least, its like romans 13 or something).  Writing the paper was when my doubts about Christianity became overwhelming.

ALL SCRIPTURE IS GOD BREATHED

The Bible was written by men.  Not God.  I know that God Breathed doesn't mean it was written by God.  But the men that wrote it weren't perfect.  Neither is it.

PREDETERMINATION

God does not have a plan for you.  YOU are the master of your own fate.  Life is whatever you want to make of it.  CONGRATS ENJOY!

One last thought: The Christian Church today is not the same as it was in Roman times.  Christians are no longer fed to lions or crucified.  They have become self righteous, blind, unquestioning.  BUT, they are a product of deception.  Dont hate Christians.  Help them.  I'm looking at you /r/atheism.  The best way to get through to Christians in my opinion is to demonstrate that yes, it is possible for non-Christians to demonstrate a high moral character.  Be loving, be merciful, be faithful.  Also show them that it is possible to have joy! without Jesus.

Thanks for reading!  I can not express how good I feel today.  Also thanks to reddit for building my self confidence and giving me the courage to make this decision.

TL;DR
I rejected my 24 year old commitment to Christ today, and I feel great."

fzwko,5,2011-03-08,What would you advise me to do in this sensitive situation?,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/fzwko/what_would_you_advise_me_to_do_in_this_sensitive/,"I will try to make this concise for your benefits. I am a 22yo male, college grad living with his parents. Never been in a relationship before due to anxiety/self-esteem issues--these have been mostly resolved but there is still work that could be done. Sexual history? Only one drunken make-out/grind. So, to go on...


Had class with girls A (Now 20) and B last year. Asked Girl A to help me with an internship project sort of to find out if I *liked her* liked her, she agreed. We didn't communicate perfectly and I wound up dating Girl B afterwards instead (just once really). Girl B and Girl A and I all sat in close proximity in class that spring, making for some very awkward pre-lecture conversations. My shitass phone would also pocketdial Girl A randomly for some reason the entire semester even though I was not pursuing her, definitely not helping things out.


I was sort of a dumbass--still sort of am--and didn't understand that Girl A actually liked me throughout, retrospectively made obvious by recollecting each conversation with her starting with a compliment to me. I stopped going to class after Girl B rejected me due to my air of desperation and the shame I had surrounding all of it.


Fastforward like 8 months to this winter. I see Girl A in a drugstore dressed plainly, no makeup and just sweats on. This is a big deal because she is usually one of those girls who really does herself up each day and I tell myself to compliment her on looking great. She compliments me first and even though I want to say so much, I freeze up and can't find anything useful to say much other than hi and bye.


That was a couple months ago and this past weekend I courage-wolf'd up and asked her out over the phone, nothing specific, just requested to see her. She acquiesced and after she flies back into town from spring break this coming weekend we are going to meet up. I am going into it with the ""itprobablywontworkdontgetyourhopesupohmanihopeitdoes"" and if I have no idea if she is just playing with me or is really interested still. 


She is quite smart, what most would consider attractive, and I think our personalities would be an intriguing if not compatible match. 

**TL;DR:** I got a date with a girl I like a lot, who I haven't talked to really in almost a year.  I know she used to have an attraction to me but there is no clue of her current feelings.

*I want a long-term thing out of this if things go well.* **Tips, advice, things definitely not to do?** I remembered to compliment her about her diminuitive outfit while still on the phone with her and she appreciated my thought (at least got her to laugh).
Also, no one has to tell me not to be upset when it doesn't materialize because I get told that all the time already by my family no matter the girl.

Thanks in advance for any help."
fzv3d,7,2011-03-08,I tried killing myself when I was younger. Here are some thoughts/suggestions.,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fzv3d/i_tried_killing_myself_when_i_was_younger_here/,"I admit that I  haven't really contributed anything to the Reddit community (I don't really vote, I just sort of click the links and move on), but after seeing a lot of posts about suicide/depression, I figured I should just share my experience. Bottom line is, I think a lot of people just misunderstand what it actually means to be depressed so I hope I can shed a little bit of light with my story. I'll try not to keep it **too** long.


When I was in my early 20's I started getting really depressed. Everyone around was out there living life, getting jobs, getting married, buying houses, and basically showing some sign of progress. I was stuck not finishing school and ended up moving back with my parents. I had no direction. I wasn't the type to mope about it or tell people I was depressed. I acted the same, but I just lost whatever little interest I had in anything. Everything just became gray and it was as if life lost all flavor. *Typical stuff I suppose.* A family member noticed my behavior and tried to get me to see a psychiatrist (or therapist, Im not sure what the difference is). It was probably the biggest waste of money and time ever. I wasn't the type to talk about my feelings so it was pretty insulting to see someone get paid $325 an hour to BS with me. 


Anyway, at some point I decided to do some research and googled sleeping pills and suicide. I remember reading something about a lethal dose being 3 grams or something, but I figured if I could down a whole box of over-the-counter stuff containing diphenhydramine, and mix it with a bottle of wine. I took in a pill every 5 minutes with a swig of wine. I think I was watching anime at the time too. I barely got in the 27th pill before I felt like throwing up. I literally felt my body just giving up. It was incredibly strange, all my muscles just felt like jello. Then I collapsed on my cheap IKEA futon mattress, which lay on the floor. Needless to say, my math was hilariously wrong and I woke up the next day suffering from a psychotic episode (at least that's what my psychiatrist told me afterwards when I described the experience). And for those that don't know, a psychotic episode is basically being schizophrenic for a short period of time. I thought I was being attacked by mosquitos and I saw bugs in the carpet. I even tried to burn my moles off thinking they were insects burrowing into my skin. I tried taking several showers but I still felt the incessant tingling all over my body. I could barely talk because my jaw wouldn't move properly. When I drove to ""escape"" the bugs, it felt as though the road was swaying from side to side. Luckily I didn't crash into anybody. I woke up the next day and it was all gone.


The funny thing was, after that all happened (literally like a few days later), I somehow got accepted to this art/design school that I applied to just weeks before. I just packed up and left, without really saying a word to anybody. Obviously my parents knew but I really didnt give a shit about anybody else. After what had happened to me, I thought, ""Wow, I can't even die. I failed at dying. I couldn't even get that right"". So I stopped giving a fuck. What else could I possibly have to lose? Long story short: I met great people and made very lucky connections; I landed prestigious internships; I got a shitty job but with ridiculous pay; I met a wonderful woman and started a family.


Now, here is where I will set the record straight. I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying that everything turned out great and all you need to do is motivate yourself or try this or try that or follow my footsteps. That's complete bullshit. Anybody who tells you to ""just look on the bright side"", you punch them in the face. THOSE THAT HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH IT KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU. I'll be honest with you, there's a part of me that still believes that none of this is real. It could be parts of that psychotic episode or schizophrenia lingering in my system. But I just found it funny that between that incident until now, fortunate things have happened.. almost too fortunate, too coincidental. This is what happens when I watch movies like Vanilla Sky. *BTW side note: Tom Cruise's suicide scene - SPOT ON.* So, deep inside, there still exists that part of me that thinks its still OK to die, again. Or, perhaps this is all a simulation or I'm stuck in a dream-like coma in some hospital. Who knows. But for the time being, I have a beautiful family and I have responsibilities now. So I just learned to live with my psychotic-ness in check. Sort of like how A Beautiful Mind ended. It's all there, but just dormant. 


So, here's my advice. If you know someone who is suicidal, there is nothing you can do to help them. Trying to help makes it worse because you can not possibly imagine what that world is like. These two worlds speak entirely different languages. Suggesting to take them on a road trip to Vegas or some shit is like the worst idea ever. It may be fun for YOU, but to them you're only proving their dissatisfaction with the world. You have no idea what it's like to have zero interest in existing. The best thing you can do is to keep them busy, not intentionally obvious, but if they are good at one thing, just focus on that and keep them preoccupied doing it. Start off asking for a favor, like ""hey can you fix my computer"" and then have it turn into, ""oh Im thinking about taking down Geek Squad, you want to go into business with me?"" But dont ever say it like ""Heeeyyy... I know you're depressed and all, so why dont you try doing this? It will make you feel better, I promise."" That's like trying to cheer up someone in a wheelchair by forcing them to watch an inspirational documentary about wheelchair heroics. And if you can't come up with anything good then just leave them alone. 


If you are the suicidal one, then try to keep your ass fucking busy as shit. It doesn't matter what you do. Just start something. I understand it's incredibly tough. But it's amazing how not giving a fuck can work miracles. Just stop caring. There's really nothing to stop you at this point. And don't let others guilt you into thinking anything else. I'll admit that I don't know how to help individuals with relationship depression. I've never gone through that. My depression was mostly, ""Oh we are insignificant ants living on a tiny sphere with limited resources and all our species cares about is trading commodities through this imaginary monetary system... and one solar flare could wipe us all out."" But just from my experience, I can tell you that keeping myself busy for a long period of time made me eventually lose track about what I was truly depressed about. It didnt make me forget, but just displaced my focus. It's like smoking. You don't think to yourself, ""oh I'm going to quit today, I'm going to quit today."" You just distract yourself long enough to question your initial desires. Oh, and watching movies like Vanilla Sky, Shutter Island, Inception, Fight Club, Matrix proooobably doesn't help all that much, but whatever, they're good movies. 


Please send me any questions if you have any. I'm not trying to do an AMA here but I will be glad to help any way I can. 


**tl;dr** If you are depressed, and are seeking help, try to keep yourself busy. Sometimes turning to others may not be the most comforting solution. My experiences have taught me to just start something random and keep myself so busy that eventually my depression (suicide attempt) became a memory... that I would ultimately share with Reddit. And feel free to ask any questions you may have. I'll try my best to help.

As part of the program there is a really nice 1year long internship. I’ve researched the companies that hire interns/graduates from this university and something that really caught me was along the lines of research analyst (in the sense research on the biotech/pharma industry) for a company involved in investment banking, capital acquisition, merger&amp;acquisition etc. etc.  So I’m wondering how much knowledge should someone who has this position would need to succeed?  Like should I know the major products of the big players; Pfizer, roche, eli lilly etc off the top of my head and what kind of areas they focus on in addition to having knowledge of smaller unknown companies? Just wondering if someone out there might have experience in this. "

* &gt;Dear Family and Friends, 

God has given me an exciting opportunity that I need to share with you. The Society of Anglican Missionaries and Senders (SAMS) has accepted me as a Bridger (missionary intern) in Cochabamba, Bolivia as a youth worker.

-Bolivia borders Brazil and Argentina. Cochabamba is situated right in the middle of the beautiful Andes mountains.

-From May 20 to August 20, 2011, I will be working with SAMS missionaries Frank and Shawnee Lyons. Bishop Lyons oversees the Anglican Diocese of Bolivia. Mrs Lyons will be my mentor.

-I will be working with and spreading God's love among young adults in Cochabamba through the Diocese's youth programs!

Redeemer Anglican Church in Chicago, my home church, is my sending and supporting congregation. I am also contributing financially to the trip; but I also need your prayers and financial gifts. I need to raise $5,600 by April 20 in order to pay for transportation, housing, and other costs associated with the mission. Please consider contributing to my mission in Bolivia. Here’s how you can help:

-Send donations by mail. All gifts are tax-deductable and should be made out to SAMS with my name in the memo line. You can send donations by mail in the enclosed envelope to:

SAMS
P.O. Box 399
Ambridge PA 15005

-Contribute online. Go to www.SAMS-USA.org and click on “Online Giving” in the upper right hand corner of the page. You can click on “Create an Account” if you choose to create an account where you can manage your gifts and contact information. If you prefer not to have an account, you can click on the “Give Now” option. In the pull down menu, choose “Bridgers/Interns.” In the new pull-down menu, find “Andrews, Jacob.” Put in your donation amount and complete the online donor information to make your online donation. It’s that easy!

-Prayer. God accomplishes great things when His people work together. In addition to financial support, I need your prayers, before, during, and after my time overseas. If you would like to commit to praying every day for me and my mission, please tell me. I would be happy to send you periodic updates and prayer requests while on the field. Once in Bolivia, I will also be using my blog (chiasticsarcast.livejournal.com) to chronicle my mission.

This opportunity to share the love of Jesus in Bolivia thrills me, and I thank you deeply for your support. God will bless you for your gifts and prayers. I will continue to update you on the progress of my mission; I look forward to share this experience with you.

In His service,
Jacob


* I replied, 

Since you contacted me via facebook message, I think it is fit and appropriate to respond to your request for money honestly and fully. Let me begin by saying there is absolutely nothing I sympathize with in your letter, let alone can begin to accept as valid. While I of course respect you as an individual and old schoolmate, you sound utterly delusional, corrupt and fearfully misguided.

You may be the archetype of modern day religious indoctrination and so I expect any appeals I make to reason will be lost in a cloud of lies, fantasy and god. I cannot blame you for this; I know these ideas were saturated into your being from such an early age. So, I hold no grudge or distaste towards you personally besides the intrusion and audacity of your request for money. A request I could not properly respond to without reminding you there is no god.

You and your letter are the product of a 2000 year old lie that history will remember only as the grandest tool ever used to control the dimwitted and gullible masses whom history has used as pawns. If you are entirely oblivious to this truth, which I imagine you are, it is a consequence of your god-constrained mental spectrum, not its lack of veracity. 

Your request for money is appalling and inappropriate considering it is nothing but a sham for a summer vacation in Bolivia. I or any other reasonably minded person would dare not request money for a trip to spread the word of Darwin and Dawkins because the inherent nature or missionary work is corrupt and self guided. No one will gain or be enriched from your trip except for you. In fact, you can only do harm and stall the real and mental development of a community as Christianity has done to all of the Western world for centuries. God is a plague that stunts mental growth and stifles freedom, justice and intelligence.

As the world forgets more and more about god, I hope that you can allow yourself to think critically and freely without constraint or predisposition, or you can waste your numbered years wandering this world living and preaching a lie.

I apologize if I have offended you,

Svein

**Edit**

* His response,

Not offended at all. Actually, I'm touched you took so long to write such a well thought out response. Clearly you think religion is just as important as I think it is, and worth spending time, if perhaps not money, to promote. May God bless you for your commitment!

However, I do take issue with your questioning of my moral standing. You say that I'm delusional in believing religion does anyone good; but you also say that I am corrupt and selfish for spreading religion.

If I'm delusional, and truly believe that religion does good to people, then I'm not being selfish, because I truly believe that what I'm doing is doing good, even if it's not.

On the other hand, if I realize that what I'm doing only hurts people, and am just looking to get money for a vacation in South America, then I'm not delusional, because I realize that I'm hurting people.

As a matter of fact, I do believe that missions does good to people. In my confused, brainwashed mind, I'm acting out of altruism. So I'm just delusional: corrupted perhaps, but not corrupt."
g0nkg,13,2011-03-09,IAmAn (undercover) atheist living with an Opus Dei. AMA.,godawini,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/g0nkg/iaman_undercover_atheist_living_with_an_opus_dei/,"Hullo r/atheism. I've been a fan/lurker of yours for a while (and an atheist even longer), but only recently did I decide that the time was ripe to dedicate my life to FSM and eating babies :)

Though I'm posting this as an AMA, I hope to be answering a lot of questions (and entertaining people) with the story-like prose that follows.

**A short introduction before I cut to the chase:** I'm an American currently living in Spain doing a post-graduation internship before I start real life (a job) in September (really, just as an excuse to travel while making money and international friends). I'm working at the University of Navarra, the university founded by the priest who also founded the Opus Dei (Josemaria). I was raised Catholic (and was even an altar boy!) but shed those chains as soon as I realized I could think for myself.

**Alright, to the meat:**
First, I know exactly what you guys are thinking: ""Like that guy who whips himself in 'The Da Vinci Code'?!"" Well, yes, but no. The crazy in the movie was an Opus Dei, but neither my roommate nor any of the other Opus' he or I know (and there are plenty here) practice [mortification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortification_of_the_flesh). For a reasonably accurate (after crosschecking with my roommate) summary of the objective facts about the Opus Dei, [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_Dei) does a pretty good job.

As for my situation... I have been to church exactly twice with my roommate, who has assumed that ""being raised Catholic"" implies ""being Catholic"". AFAIK, he is unaware of my religious ""leanings"" (and I will probably keep it that way as it's not worth it to me to either get the boot from the apartment at the worst, or make it an awkward 3 more months at the best). My roommate goes to mass 7 days a week (I kid you not), and has asked me a handful of times if I wanted to go to mass with him (maybe once a week). I respectfully decline every time (except the first time, which was for bonding and curiosity purposes), and he doesn't seem to mind. However, he seemed particularly interested/concerned that I make it to the Ash Wednesday mass today, so I thought, hell, I'd humor him. My only concern was a rumor I've heard about bless'd ashes burning through heathen skin, but I figured it was worth the risk. Hilariously enough, the priest missed my forehead and hit my hair when applying the ashes - I think it was a sign/protection from His Noodliness.

Outside of church, my roommate is actually a very cool and bright guy - without a doubt, I would consider him my friend. He has a Ph.D in Computer Science (Opus Dei work ethic is pretty intense). We play MarioKart pretty regularly. He drinks, and even made it until 8:00 am this past weekend, partying with my friends (to be clear, he doesn't lose control). That being said, I definitely wouldn't ""come out"" to him (see above).

I think that's it - feel free to ask any questions you might have!

**TL;DR: I'm an (undercover) atheist living with an Opus Dei. I also went to an Ash Wednesday mass today and didn't burn in flames.**"

I've been going to school for Computer Networking Management. Classes were boring, and way too early, but I slogged through them, came out with a 3.5 GPA, and moved on to my internship.

Problem is, the school sent me to some place in West Hartford that does computer recycling. My first day(yesterday), first 3 hours I spent replacing RAM sticks in 50+ IBMs, then replaced a few power supplies, and then checked in the next batch of computers, to do the same damn thing today. As you can tell, not a thing to do with networking, other than checking in a few routers.

The school sent me to one other place for interview, but they declined both me and the other student they sent.

I know computers, I know the software, but I just don't have hands on experience. So I ask you, Connecticut; does anyone here know/have a company, any size, that would be willing to take on a computer tech intern, for 9 weeks? Free labor, I'm easy to get along with/get along with most people, and can guarantee I won't get in your way.

tl;dr Computer Networking Management course sent me to an internship that doesn't have anything to do with Networking or Management. Discuss.

How should I even feel about it?",praisethefallen,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/g07x9/im_being_sued_in_the_ironic_suit_of_the_decade/,"The suit is over a motor vehicle accident from more than a year ago.
In brief, I roll through a stop sign on a clear street and get side swiped by a person going almost twice the speed limit.
His truck was fine, my car was totaled.
Then my car rolls back over me; he, the cop he was friends with, and my brother shove the car off of me. I need to relearn how to walk for the next few months, after half a million in medical debt. It prevents me from taking any jobs or internships during that precious post college year. No legal action or charges pressed. Only reason why I was deemed at fault was my brother stated that I ignored the stop sign to pull out, while I claimed that I was making legal turn and slowed appropriately. Cop didn't exactly trust the kid under the car.

Today I find out he's trying to sue for mental anguish and back pain, among other things. Insurance will likely cover most of it, but frankly, I find the suit absurd. Honestly, my only thought is that his back pain was probably caused by him willingly trying to move a car off of me, if it wasn't entirely made up. But it's hard to not feel like a prick saying ""You get nothing, sir! Your pain was your dumb fault for helping me stay alive!"" (not that my brother and the cop wouldn't have been enough)

So in a way, he fucked up my life and then saved it. And now is coming back to fuck it up again for a few dollars. To quote a popular adage: Wut do‽

(Already calling insurance adjusters, and will call cop tomorrow, despite his relation to the other driver. Also I know I am likely half at fault, I'm mostly just bitter that I'm getting a frivolous lawsuit to drag me back to one of the more difficult moments of my life)"

brief media video interview on our ordeal :

http://www.newsnow.lk/index.php?option=com_jomtube&amp;view=video&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=75

                 DETAILED VERSION OF OUR STORY 


We are two sisters on the run, to save ourselves, from the very people , that in the conventional society would be referred to as ''Family''. We were born in an ultra-conservative Muslim family in United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi. My younger sister was born in the year 1994, and I in 1988. Our family is originally from Pakistan; hence, that makes us Pakistanis.


 I was a victim of severe childhood abuse till the age of 13, my parents being the abusers.  My mother was an extremist and always wanted control of our lives and if things weren’t done her way, if we didn’t oblige, we’d suffer the consequences through beatings.  Just to quote a few of her beating rituals; she’d dunk my little brother and my face in the toilet, threatening to kill us at that very instant if we didn’t promise to abide by her rules.  At another instance , she grabbed my tongue and held a knife in her hand, and told me that she’d cut if off and peel off my face to the extent that no one would be able to recognize me , if I were to ever have a bite of food again.  We are three siblings, and we all got our beatings for different reasons.  I was beaten, just because I was overweight as a kid and that to them was not acceptable because according to them, it meant, that I’d have a hard time finding a suitable partner, which by the Islamic law they would find for me. My sister on the other hand was beaten for having a sharp tongue, even though she was the youngest,  nevertheless  she was aware of what was going on.  My brother would be beaten up because he aspired to be a soccer player instead of becoming an Engineer or a Doctor or any profession that was respectable in their eyes.  Us sisters would never get beaten by our father, instead he would stick to verbal abuse, in public , as well as at times like family dinners.  My mother had three brothers and three sisters.  One of the brothers and one of her sisters had molested,  three of my first cousin’s, and I became aware of this when I was 14, as my cousins had warned me to stay cautious for myself and my sister. Both of us never got molested from the family, but we got molested by people outside the family.  I never discussed my case with our parents, and these were the last people I could rely on. My sister’s case on the other hand, was reported to the police and I believe the case is still on-going. 


Now I want to jot down the most current events that came into play, leaving me no choice but to flee the country. After being a victim of severe childhood abuse at home, sexual harassment in public and at my university back in Pakistan, at the age of18 I got my chance to go to Royal Holloway University of London, England, to graduate. By the year 2010, I had completed 2 years of my Computer Science course.  Spending time away from my parents helped me discover myself and things I truly believed in.  I was no longer a Muslim, rather an Agnostic. My little sister on the other hand, started questioning the idea of God at the very tender age of 12 and gave up religion and stopped believing in God at the age of 13. This was something we kept discreet, as if our family was to find out about any of it, they would have locked us up. Moreover by this time, how our parents treated and dealt with both of us, and our brother had completely changed. They now support him with his dream of being a cricketer , whereas, our dreams are futile and meaningless to them , as at the end of the day all they care about is for us two to be wedded to wealthy families. 


 After having completed 2 years at the University, I had decided to take a gap year, before graduating, in order to pursue my dream of becoming a performer (singer, songwriter) instead. I had planned on using the tuition fee for the third year, provided by our parents, and strictly saw it as a loan that I would return overtime, to enroll myself in a music college. Our family is one of wealth and I couldn’t come forth with this desire of mine as in our family’s eyes it was sin and something that would completely devastate the family’s honor.  Also over the time spent in England, I had met a Polish man, Lukasz Sitkowski , and we had planned to elope soon, though when I mentioned it to my mother, she didn’t find it acceptable as he was an Atheist and wanted him and his family to convert to Islam first , if I was to marry him. I was no longer a virgin and this was something again my family was and still is unaware of. If they were to find out that I no longer was a virgin, I’d be stoned to death.
My sister and I would always communicate with one another through e-mail, and Skype.  Our mother hired a computer guy to find out what it was that we discussed most of the time. Through him, she found out about my future plans, along with the fact that I was an agnostic, and my sister an Atheist. She never uttered a word of it to anyone. 


During the summer of 2010, I didn’t want to come back, thus I didn’t. I worked as a waitress at Nandos instead. I didn’t tell our parents about my job as a waitress at Nandos, because to them, again, it was something that was condescending and scorned upon by the family. Therefore, I told our parents that I was doing an internship in the I.T department.  My mother convinced me to visit for 2 weeks, using our fathers’ made-up illness as a mere excuse to visit. I expressed to my sister that my instincts lead me to believe that something unfortunate awaited me in Pakistan. Regardless, I silenced the voices in my head, and chose to visit, because I wanted to see her.


During this period of time, our brother, who too was studying in London, had come to visit our parents, as well. My sister arrived in Pakistan on the 4th of September,2010. After a week, she realized that her passport was missing. Our mother made us believe that it was stolen at the airport, or that my sister was a victim of black magic, and that ‘’Jins’’ (spiritual beings known to Muslims) had misplaced it. After two weeks, since the disappearance of the passport, my sister, was convinced that our mother had the passport, and had us almost believe a lie. Our mother had gone to the extent of advertising for the lost passport in the newspapers. As to my sisters’ suspicion, we found the lost passport, in her storage space. She called my brother right away, and let him know that our mother had stolen it. He believed us right away. We had had thought that our father wasn’t involved in the whole situation, thus, we planned on telling him that we had found the passport. When they returned from the airport, we told him. He ended up strangling me, because I wouldn’t give up my passport. They managed to take away the passport anyhow. I had suffered several minor bruises. My mother told us that “Allah” had lead her to all of this and not her nosiness. My father told me sister dishonored the family by merely being a waitress at Nandos. Our mother on the other hand told us that she desired to kill both of us; me for wanting to become a performer and being an Agnostic, as that was seen as a sin and something ‘’haram’’ (Impermissible) in Islam, and my little sister,  for being an Atheist. She said it would be the right thing to do to save us from the fire of hell, and also to help us avoid the committing these so-called sins in her eyes.


For two straight months, we were on a curfew. They had 6 servants working for them, and they were all strictly instructed that none of us was to be allowed to leave the house. During these two months, we didn’t leave our room. After two months, one of our first cousins’ named ‘’Osama’’ came for a visit. After a short period of time, in his presence, they allowed us to go out, and we availed this opportunity to the maximum. I applied for a new passport, and received it. Over the next month, we kept planning our escape, including our source of funds, all the documents we needed such as our birth certificates, passports etc. Over time, we found exactly where each document was placed in her room. My sisters’ boyfriend tried getting a loan for us, but it didn’t work out. Being desperate, as nothing seemed to fall into place, we planned to steal her gold jewelry. We discussed the fact that if countries for their freedom kill and plunder, because our means justified our end; that being freedom of speech, expression, and thought. We managed to sell the jewelry and receive enough money to escape. We knew we wouldn’t have enough time to apply for the visa once we were out of the house, because they would track us down. My mothers’ brother knew a lot of politicians, and the head of the police department. They had bribed them before, and had asked them for many favors previously, and the police would do so, again without question. 


 We decided to go to Sri Lanka on a one month tourist visa that would be given to us on arrival. We escaped on the 28th of January, and now reside in Sri Lanka. As we suspected, our mothers’ brother contacted the head of the police department, and the head of the ministry of interior, and, convinced them to put us on the Exit Control List (ECL). This meant that we wouldn’t be allowed to leave Pakistan, if we even tried. Fortunately, it was issued the day of our escape, so it was too late. They have sent us a threat to contact them, and told us that if we do, they will help take our names off the ECL list.  We still have the mail as proof. Our visa for Sri Lanka expires within less than a month. 


Once I received the mail, I had no option but to contact UNHCR and seek for asylum, as I though that being on the ECL wouldn’t allow me to get approved for any sort of visa for, any foreign country. Our case at the moment with UNHCR is pending, though due to undue pressure from the Pakistani government, brought on, because of my uncle being influential with the Pakistani government; our application was made a priority. The UNHCR usually takes about 5 to 6 months to call in for an interview, and we were called within a month. I don’t know whether that is in our favor or not, as I am aware that there exist a comradery between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, hence I fear, that I application might get rejected. Now the current situation is that, my uncle and my mother, arrived in Colombo, looking for us on the 4th February. The contacted the tourist police, and made up the story that me and my sister came to Sri lanka for touring purposes and are now missing. The police managed to track us down, but after having shown them the asylum seeker certificate issued to us by the UNHCR, they backed off. During this period, we were forced to confront our mother at the police station, and she denied to have done anything and threatened me that I would never be able to leave Sri lanka and that she would stay here until I am here. My younger sister is 16, a minor, and my parents are her legal guardians. My mother now wants to take my sister back and use her as a bargaining chip to get me back to Pakistan as well, as that is the only card she has left to play. She will torture her, and her knowing how much I love my sister, would come back to save her and so they will have both of us back in Pakistan. At present there is a court case going on where me and my mother are fighting for my sister custody. The next date is on the 14th of march. My sister and I , just want a chance at life , at freedom, and the opportunity to be able to make something of our lives. We need advise on what should we do and if there is a possibility , that me and my sister can somehow settle in the UK , without declaring asylum either in Sri lanka or in the UK. We are capable enough to make something out of our lives , if given a chance. We are fighting hard for our freedom and we really need help. We have limited funds, but enough to spend a few months in the UK, until we manage to get jobs. But the real problem is how do we get to the UK?. Please for all who would be reading this, we need a helping hand, advice , anything that can help us. Any response from any one of you would be appreciated.We need to be heard by all governments, and we need help with spreading out the word. I’m trying to get hold of news channels like CNN and BBC, but it might take time.

g2b8q,1,2011-03-11,My life is awesome.,gerusz,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/g2b8q/my_life_is_awesome/,"Hey, Reddit!

My life sucked ~1.5 years ago. But now it's awesome!

1.5 years ago, I was after a rough breakup. I didn't believe I could find anyone who accepts me as I am. Now I have a girlfriend who is hot, smart, sane and cool. I hit the fucking motherload with her!

My academic life wasn't horrible back then. But now I know I'm awesome at anything if I invest some time in it. 1.5 years ago I was just another university student living off their parents. Since then I've completed a 1 year paid internship. It was one of the best experiences in my life. Now I know that I'm capable of pretty much anything in my field. While I might not finish college this semester, it's pretty much guaranteed that I will finish it next semester. So my academic life rocks too.

And my professional life? Well, I'm currently designing a software that will fill a rather large, and as for now empty niche. So I'm probably going to earn a six-figure amount (in EUR).

Conclusion: my life rocks!"
g2v00,7,2011-03-12,Tearful discussion with boyfriend; still have misgivings,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2v00/tearful_discussion_with_boyfriend_still_have/,"Long time listener, first time caller. This turned out a lot longer than I expected. 

CONTEXT: My boyfriend and I (both 21) have been together about a year and a half. We go to different schools about an hour apart; I am living at home and commuting to school. I am applying to his school (not primarily to be with him; it's the best school for my major, I was accepted a few years ago but decided not to go because it was so expensive, but I realize now it was a mistake). Mainly, I drive to see him and spend most of my time at his school, as he doesn't have a car. I see him every weekend and sometimes in the middle of the week. We have never fought per se, but occasionally have mature discussions that end with one or both of us in tears. This is the best and longest relationship either of us has ever been in, largely due to how well we communicate with one another. We have always practiced ""real talk,"" in which are able to bring up anything that's bothering us, no matter how petty, slight or irrational. It's a system that has worked extremely well for us.  Never any built-up resentment or misdirected irritation. Until now. 

THE TEARFUL DISCUSSION: Yesterday we went out to lunch and got coffee afterwards. After staring pensively into his lap for a few minutes, he looked up abruptly and asked me, ""Do you think we're getting boring?"" The ensuing discussion covered a couple of points: 

*I have a lot of shit going on (school full time, work part time, two internships, really demanding volunteer work, transfer apps) and I look to this relationship as a source of stability, whereas he might look to it as a source of excitement. When we first started going out, I was working full time, but still had a lot of time and energy to come up with fun shit for us to do. In the first six months of our relationship, I arranged for us to go caving, see a dressage show, planetarium shows, Shakespeare in the zoo. All kinds of adventuring and exploring. I don't have the time or energy to arrange that kind of shit now. 

*He's frustrated with the distance and ""wants to be able to call me up to come over on a Tuesday night."" 

*He wants me to be closer to his friends and to have my own on campus...I have finally built up a rapport with his friends to the point where I'm not struggling at parties to keep myself socially occupied so as not to be at his elbow the whole time. His friends universally like me. He tells me they tell him how smart, articulate, beautiful etc. I am. 

*He feels that we're falling into a routine, but because we live so far apart and seeing him entails so much time/effort/gas money on my part, there's little opportunity for spontaneity. 

*Midway into the conversation, he said ""Sometimes I feel like we're just really good friends."" I fucking froze and started getting pretty upset because that sounds really bad, although I didn't cry, because we were still in the coffee shop. He noticed, but I told him not to react to my emotions, because it was important for him to verbalize this now. I asked him if he was attracted to me. He said yes. I asked him if he loved me. He said yes. 

He says he can't really trace the disquiet he feels to a specific source and that's why it bothers him so much.  I told him that if he needs time to figure his shit out, we could ""make adjustments"" to our relationship (ie take a break), but he declined. He said he needs to see me more, not less. 

We ended the conversation with him acknowledging it could just be the drudgery of winter, and that he wasn't sure if he was just projecting his own ennui on to our relationship, but when I asked him if he was feeling bored in other areas of his life, he said no. I told him to continue monitoring his feelings about it and told him I was glad he  brought it up with me, even though I was upset and a little scared. 

Even though I wasn't planning to, I went back with him. We had pizza and beer, filled out some summer job applications, fucked emphatically, got up in the morning and went for a two hour hike. He told me he loved me, that I had a beautiful soul, that he's glad he met me, etc. Everything felt normal. 

**One thing is still bothering me, and I can't shake it.  His comment about ""sometimes it feels like we're just friends."" That sounds really bad, right? When I repeated it back to him and asked him to clarify, he said I was twisting his words. Am I overemphasizing the importance of that statement and freaking out over nothing?** 

FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS: 
*I left school due to major depression. I have come a really really long way, in some part due to him. I have told him more than once that he played a role in my recovery process, but he's expressed discomfort with it before. I don't think he wants responsibility for my sanity. I have assured him that he doesn't, and am pretty independent and self-sufficient. I decline most compliments when he knows I'm feeling bad because, as I tell him, I don't want him to have to reassure me. 

*We only get to have sex 2-5 times a week, because I only see him once or twice a week. Both of us wish we were having sex more frequently. However, it's great when we can get it. I am the only girl who's been able to make him come from head, and he thought he couldn't until me. I know this isn't a line, because I couldn't even get him to come from head until about a year into our relationship, and I tried my damndest. 


TL;DR: Boyfriend begins conversation with ""Do you think we're boring?"" and also mentions ""sometimes it seems like we're just really good friends."" Insists he loves me, is attracted to me. Sex is good, although infrequent due to distance (2-5 times per week). After wrenching discussion, things return to normal, but I am still fixated on the thought that he thinks of us as friends. "

Looking for bridge / tunnel near atlanta! My gf and I grew up in the Suwanee area and we know bit and pieces of Atlanta. We both go to Georgia Southern and recently I got an internship in Douglasville. So we've been doing a lot of things in Atlanta that we have never done before. 

Question: 
A couple of months ago I remember looking a picture of under bridge or tunnel and it was well lit and a small boat was going down it. I can't remember if I saw stores along side the river under the bridge or reading that stores are near by. 

Any ideas as to what I'm talking about? This is really just a shot in the dark. 

Also does anyone know of cheap things to do while my girl friend is on spring break?

Thanks for all you help,
Alfa 

**Edit**:

Just got back. 
Turns out that we drove though that tunnel earlier today. I didn't realize that tunnel had flooded in the photograph. We got there and drove through tunnel again the drove around looking for something like a river. Took us 30 mins then asked a guy going out to his car where this river / tunnel was. He then told us how the area had flooded and how that's the tunnel.

/facepalm


Thanks guys for the help. We're heading back there tomorrow to visit some of the shops. Any recommendations?

g3l35,134,2011-03-14,I live in Sendai and am OK. I'd like to share my updates to counter some fear mongering.,johnwalkr,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/g3l35/i_live_in_sendai_and_am_ok_id_like_to_share_my/,"I'm moving to a new location so I'm just quickly copy-pasting this from multiple facebook notes/[blog posts](http://www.inertreactants.com/?p=237). There might be some repeated statements, etc. I'm in Japan on an internship related to a [google lunar x-prize team](http://www.whitelabelspace.com/2011/03/rover-prototype-body-complete.html).

**update 1:**
I am OK in Sendai, as is everyone I know here. Thank you everyone for the messages.

They are already starting to restore power and water to the city of Sendai.

The earthquake itself was pretty scary but afterwards everything is very well organized; we waited outside after the earthquake and eventually were allowed to grab our stuff from the lab. We left quickly after an aftershock and possible gas leak. At my dorm we are staying together in a group.

Where I am located in the city I don't have running water or power but we are safe with lots of food and water.

Although the shaking was quite violent, there are no buildings in the city itself that collapsed and flooding was confined to the subway system as far as I know. We knew it was serious right away as it was the first time we heard the early warning detection alarm (3 seconds before) and it was impossible to stay standing.

It was much worse to the West where soil conditions are worse and to the East where tsunamis hit. We weren't aware of how serious things were until we heard news reports.

In the city today, restaurants were giving free food and people were in good spirits, although you can see smoke from fires near the coast and there are smaller fires in the city.

Local groups are also making rice and soup for people. Basically the same food I've been eating since I arrived, but it's not lukewarm like at the cafeteria!

Convenience stores were open today, where people patiently lined up in the dark to buy a couple of day's worth of food each. I got food there, and was also given food by the school, as well as flashlights and batteries.

Amazingly, a handful of stores and bars where even open by the main station this afternoon.

There are buildings designated as refuges where people in tall and evacuated buildings are staying.

The news images are not from Sendai city, they are from surrounding areas. The aftershocks were quite large and frequent until this morning but have subsided now.

The nuclear reactors are not posing a serious risk according to local media, and despite the recent explosion widespread fallout is not a strong possibility for this type of plant and failure.

We are not sure if/when we can go back to the lab. Many experiments were damaged but our rover was OK when we left it. I am uploading pictures from the lab and city now.

I'm currently with friends in the city centre where we found power and 3G internet. I should be able to update occasionally directly and via friends (email is sporadically working on my phone).

I want to stress that I am OK and in a safe place.

**update 2:**
Update: the rover is ok and in my dorm. Many are leaving Sendai by (free) bus, but the lineups are up to 500m long and you can only go North (ish).

The journey to Tokyo is indirect and about 20 hours. It looks like convenience stores and supermarkets are out of food but military trucks are starting to arrive with supplies, and there are neighborhood food storage buildings. Today more restaurants were open, selling take-away versions of their food but selling out quickly.

Where there is power, ATMs and vending machines work. Bicycle stores are booming but I haven't heard of the gas station situation one way or another.

Life downtown is pretty normal. Inspections appear to have started today and some are back at work.

Still no power or running water in my area but we have lots of supplies.

A main concern is aftershocks of up to M7, but that's 100 times less energetic than the original earthquake. People are also concerned about the nuclear reactor failure in Fukushima but my understanding, with Rob's (nuclear medicine specialist) help, is that it's not very dangerous for us, 80km away.

**update 3:**
Many people are leaving Sendai, but it is very difficult to go South to Tokyo, which is where most need to go. At the moment it is a 500m bus lineup followed by an apparently 20 hour long journey. They will run out of fuel in a day or two but I think it won't take long to start getting more, as food only took one day to start arriving.

I'm the only english speaker left at my dorm, so I am heading to stay with another group of people on the ground floor of an apartment building.

I already had a bus ticket to Tokyo for this weekend. I have no idea if I can get on that bus. It will need to be rerouted as normally it goes though Fukushima.

University is closed until at least May. My internship was supposed to end in late April. My current plan is to get to Tokyo when I can, and then make a decision on staying to finish my work or leaving.

There is a small amount of work to get part of our GLXP rover to Europe for testing and demonstrations. I will be bringing those parts to Tokyo in order to ship them. The rest of the rover is safe in my dorm.

If I get stuck in Sendai I should be safe. There were a couple of large (M6?) aftershocks today and they are expected for one month up to M7 (100 times less energy than the original). There is plenty of food and water available and my dorm now has water, power and internet.

The main concern is nuclear fallout but from what I understand of the design and situation of the reactors were are reasonably safe. Preventative medicine is available if it is needed and the worst case scenario does not involve danger at short-term exposure lengths.

Many thanks to the heroic nuclear workers who have sacrificed their lives keeping the country safe."
g4o88,2,2011-03-15,"Paralegal desperately seeking employment anywhere that will offer me a (paid) position - lawyers know other lawyers, so please help",notwetodded,nyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/g4o88/paralegal_desperately_seeking_employment_anywhere/,"Long time lurker here, and I wish I had a post-history to verify anything I am about to say. I am in desperate need of a job, preferably one in the legal market. I posted this in r/jobs and, due to my geographic location, was referred here. I can see the comments now - ""The law market is saturated as of right now."" Yeah, that's true, but so are other markets. I can be an invaluable member to any legal team, and therefore I should be always be in demand.

My background: Graduated SUNY Oneonta May, 2010 in the top 10% of my class with Magna Cum Laude honors, received a Best and Brightest nomination my senior year, and was on the Dean's list every semester. My senior year was also my busiest: I took the LSAT, GRE, and four (yes, 4) independent study classes, and still maintained a 3.85 GPA. I was expected to enroll in law school after graduation, however the tuition bill arrived and that journey came to an end. I still wanted to work in law, so I decided the next best thing was to pursue a career as a paralegal. I started applying for positions in August, 2010 with no luck. After one month I enrolled in Fairleigh Dickinson Universities post-baccalaureate ABA paralegal certificate program just to help my chances. I am excelling in the program with a GPA of 3.9. This may change after my final courses, but I am expecting A's.

My present: I have done prior unpaid internships and mentorships (same things) and have developed a paralegal work history, however I am usually let go so that other interns have a chance to gain experience. I am currently working for a global pharmaceutical corporation. I was expecting to work at this company full-time after graduation, but for various reasons the company has decided to go in another direction (outsourcing the entire non-lawyer staff is the main reason). I have work experience. I have been applying to 10-20 firms a day, however with little-to-no luck. Over the past 6 months, I have done around 10-15 interviews, and submitted close to 300 resumes. I am sure if I counted I can give redditors an accurate number. Lately I have been calling legal recruiters, and every time I am told they will call me back (and never do) or to send a resume (and no one calls back).

My future: Starting in April I will have the pleasure of paying back my undergraduate student loans at $1,200.00 per month. I do not have a job lined up after March. My home after this month is either my mom's couch or my friend's couch. Getting a job that is unpaid is relatively easy, however it is finding something paid where I experience great difficulty.

Before I go any further let me clarify that I AM NOT LOOKING FOR HANDOUTS, only advice and referrals. Seriously. Keep your money and donate it to someone who deserves it and needs it - I am looking for a job so I won't have to depend on other people. I know Reddit is an extremely generous place, but I don't want that kind of help. I have the internet and food in my fridge, so I'm in better shape than most people.

What I am asking for is simple: If there are any lawyers on here, lawyers know other lawyers. Help me - read over my resume, refer me to friends, heck I'll work for you (or someone you know) for free as a test run. Perhaps you are a paralegal and you know you're department is recruiting. Perhaps your dad is part of a Fortune 500 legal team and could use an extra hand. I just need a job so I can pay back my loans and go to law school. If you feel you can help, I will PM you a resume, writing sample, newspaper clippings of all research presentations, etc. My salary request is modest, about 6K-10K lower than what many firms are currently offering to start their paralegals.

The program is a collaborative venture between the Department of Economics and the Rotman School of Management (business school). Prior to coming to Toronto I completed a Bachelor of Commerce in Finance at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. I'm also a CFA Level II Candidate writing this June having completed Level I last June. Over the last three years I've worked internships at BP in Calgary as a trade analyst in market analytics (fundamentals) for their natural gas trading group, as well as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) in commercial banking. This summer I will be doing another internship in Sales and Trading at a major Canadian bank.  

**Daily market summary report:** Back in October as a way to learn how to better use a Bloomberg terminal, keep up on the markets, and keep my classmates informed I began creating a daily market summary report. Since then it has continued to grow and I now distribute it to approximately 400 people (primarily students). Everyday I send an email to my subscribers with a brief overview of the days major events and news and link to ""The Daily Roll"" which is the report that includes data and commentary on global equity, commodity, fixed income, and currency markets. The report definitely has a Canadian (and North American bias) and is fairly high level but I think gives a really good snapshot of the previous days happenings. I recently created a website for it and am now posting them on the internet (please see link below):
http://individual.utoronto.ca/parrent/DailyRoll/

So that's about it. I would love it if the Reddit finance could check out the Daily Roll and provide me any feedback that you have. Also if you want to sign up to receive it just send me an email and I'll add you to the list (its free).

I've sent about 20 applications so far around the US and willing to locate, and only heard back from 3.  

The issue is, I am graduating next year and yet I feel like I don't know how to program.  I feel like I have only lightly scratched the surface of Java, C, C++.  I had an on-campus interview with Microsoft too, and didn't make it to round 2 (The competition was tough too, I saw 3 of my previous TAs also ahead of me in the first round). 


It really is all about who you know.  I have friends who got internships who are worse programmers than I am and going in again this summer.  The issue is, they don't get any sway to get me in, and I have a small family who are mostly teachers.  Any advice apppreciated

Thanks!"

I am an undergraduate human geography/GIS student from Simon Fraser University (in Vancouver, B.C.) and am currently doing an internship where we are working on developing an online emergency mapping service.  I'm concerned with data in British Columbia.  

The geographic coordinate system the web mapping system uses is WGS 1984, Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere.  The data we are putting in is either in the GCS North American 1983 or NAD 1927. 

To go from a NAD 1927 datum to WGS 1984, I need to use the NAD_1927_To_WGS_1984_10 geographic transformation.  However, this option isn't present when I attempt to do the transformation in ArcMap.  I don't know the geographic transformation I need to use to go from GCS North American 1983 to WGS 1984 (again for British Columbia); can anyone point me in the right direction?"

They are driving me insane and I can't stand it anymore!,infcow,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/g4xsw/how_do_i_end_a_relationship_with_a_client_they/,"I'm a sophomore CS student at a small university which has a radio station. At the beginning of the the year, during the club fair, I got talking and (being the nice guy that I am) offered to help them out with their radio station website needs, as they haven't been able to get anyone with the know-how to update the website for years! I explained that I could make a new site that looked better and was simple for them to update the pages (WYSIWYG editor) without the need of a techie to do it for them.

Little did I know they had already gotten a graphic designer from the university to do an ""internship"" with the radio station. Apparently, that means making a design in Photoshop, slicing it up, and using Dreamweaver to make a demo page for me.

I sucked it up and did what I offered them, and made it everything work.

The shitty part is, I have become their #1 speed-dial whenever they break the website layout. Even though it's the fault of the graphic designer who clearly shouldn't have been solely responsible for a production website's new design.

Additionally, they stream their over-the-air broadcast on their website. The hardware they use to get the audio from the broadcast is in WMA format, which makes the only options for web streaming either: Windows Media Player plugin, or Silverlight. The old site used WMP. I went with Silverlight because it is better than relying on people having the WMP plugin installed and MIME types set properly on their PC. Of course, as soon as I do, the station manager says to switch it back to WMP because they don't have Silverlight installed. So I did.

Every so often, including today, they email me telling me the web stream doesn't work, or the website is fucked up looking, to which I have attempted to force the site to work for their specific update, or tell the specific person their computer is fucked up.

I just can't do it anymore. I did this out of my own free will. The station never offered me any money, nor am I under any contract to help them.
How do I tell them I'm done helping them out without sounding like an asshole?"

She isnt a real therapist yet, still an intern, so she had her adviser come in and talk with me as well.

I told her the same story, how low ive been feeling, and how im haunted by suicidal thoughts. They both seemed to freak out, telling me that they wanted me to be put on a 5150 and be hospitalized. I told them I had done that before and it was more hurtful than helpful.

I also told them about if I even step near a hospital I will be bankrupt. With no insurance and very little to my name, if I was admitted, I would be financially ruined.

We agreed to have twice a week sessions, and that I would sign an agreement to call them or a suicide hotline if things got really bad. (I dont know what good a suicide contract really is, if someone is going to kill themselves, do you really think a signature on paper is going to do anything about it, im sure it has to do with liability).

Anyhow, im going to go see her shortly and I dont know what to do. I want to talk out these suicidal feelings and urges, but I dont want to make things even worse. I dont really know this woman too well, and she seems to be rather green."

g6jwy,1,2011-03-18,Would you go to a overtly Christian University if it was the best school for your program of study?,[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/g6jwy/would_you_go_to_a_overtly_christian_university_if/,"  I recently took my little sister to visit some universities in Florida.  She wants to study Marine Biology, so these are some of the best places for her.  One of the schools we toured was Palm Beach Atlantic University, which is an extremely Christian school.  

  On the tour they said, ""Students are not required to be Christian, but the teachers here all must be, and all classes are taught from a Christian point of view.""  I was perplexed by this, how do you teach biology from a christian point of view without skipping half of it?  I talked to one of the tour guides about it.  I started by saying I am not christian and then asking if they skipped evolution, or something. ""What do you mean by Christian point of view?""

  She said this, ""We have to each evolution to be accredited, but we don't teach it as if its true.""  But when I asked her more questions, it became rather clear that all of the hard science professors will never tell you evolution is false - because they probably believe it but can't say so because of their agreement with the school (Don't stop reading here!)  

  The great thing about this school is that everyone is amazingly nice.  When my sister turned in her application an actual person called her. She didn't get an automatic email, or generic call.  The people here know her and seem to care about her.  They reserved a parking spot for her, they were excited to meet her, and they really want her to come - not just her money. The teachers are all very connected with their students.  Also, because of the religious affiliation, students have to do volunteer work (which they call Workship, heh).  But this always works to the benefit of the student because they build a network of places to be hired.  They are also extremely committed to getting every student the best internship possible.

  There are some ridiculous overnight rules in the dorm - no boys in girls dorms at night, no girls in boys dorms at night - but my sister would be a transfer student so she would get to skip that.  She would have mandatory chapel credits, but thats the worst of it, and they provide ways to get them by listening to speakers instead of going to church.  They don't try to convert you, they just try to make you a strong, confident person.  

  I'm not religious but I think if it was the best option for me I would do it.  

tldr:  If you had to deal with the religious affiliations of a school to get one of the best educations available with a real personal connection, would you do it?"

IAmA college grad, she is still working on a degree. Weve been together two years and lived together for 1.

Our sex life has been good. Six months ago she asked if I had any unfulfilled fantasizes so i admitted I always wanted to try anal. Really embarrassed to tell her that. Most of my friends say that guys who like anal are secretly gay so I was nervous she might feel the same. No, though, she insisted I tell her so I told her and she was really supportive and into it. We did research about how best to do it, things worked out. Since then we do it about once every couple of weeks.

Last month I realized I never asked her the same question, if she had unfulfilled fantasies. She told me she wanted dirty talk during sex and even try some sexting with dirty talk since she's out of town a lot for an internship. I come from a strict religious backgrond that would frown on this so I was nervous to try but did my best. I love this girl and want to make her happy the way shes made me happy.

Found out last night my attempts have not satisfied her. She told me staright up during a chat that I'm not being mean enough in bed. She wants to be called all sorts of bad things. Whore, slut, bitch, worthless, stupid, cunt. Those are her words, the things she wants to be called.

I played it off like I understood and will definitely do it the next time we make love once she gets back home tomorrow night. But I can't imagine saying these things to her.

One thing that worries me is that I think she was sexually abused when she was younger. While drunk she once told me a story about a ""friend"" of hers who was raped by a cousin. She was a lot drunker than I and said ""FRIEND can never tell a bf about it! It'd be to sick. Her bf would dump her, Right?""

I told her ""No if he loves her he'd support her.""

The next day I asked about her friend and she looked at me like I was high. Said she never said anything like that but I swore she did.

Fucked up situation I guess. Any advice would be cool.

tldr: My gf who might have been sexually abused in the past wants me to call her terrible names in bed. Advice?"

Unfortunately, the english versions of many university web sites are rather confusing and I don't speak any Korean whatsoever. I was hoping I could get some tips and answers to a few questions from the nice r/korea people.

* I would like to study in Seoul. Currently I'm thinking of applying to Yonsei, KAIST (not in Seoul, but it's so famous, I just wanna give it a shot), Korea University if I can still make it (application deadline is end of march @.@) and Sungkyunkwan University. Is there another university I might wanna take a look at? It doesn't need to be a top ranking school, maybe a smaller one with a nice student community or an up-and-coming school with some cool unconventional programs.

* My understanding is that the academic calendar in Korea starts with the spring semester. Would it be a good idea to postpone the application to next spring or does it not make a difference?

* How is the student mentality in Korea? I'm all for hard work but I'm a little afraid of the asian academic stereotype: test scores are everything, competition is ruthless and don't even think about takin a weekend off every once in a while. This is not supposed to offend anybody, it's just that I don't know much about Korean society. I've just been to the general area Asia once during an exchange semester in Singapore. The koreans I met there were business students with a very similar work attitude to europeans.

* My impression is that university rankings are very important to Koreans. Is there a big gap in opportunities (internships, jobs etc) for students other than the SKY universities or KAIST and PosTech?

* For you Europeans and Americans that have learned Korean, what do you think how long it takes to learn the language reasonably well? In my high school time many students went abroad to France or the US for a year to learn the language among other reasons. The rule of thumb was that by month 3 you start to slowly get the hang of it, after half a year you start to be able to hold conversations and by the end of the year you are pretty much fluent. Does this sound like a reasonable time frame to learn Korean?

Thanks to everybody that took the effort to read all this text. It's appreshiated!

My bf spends a lot of time hanging out with this guy and practicing with his new band. I didn't care for these last couple months but now Im staring to get frustrated because I feel like he never wants to hang out with me and we live together.

I have expressed these feelings to him. I asked him if when it comes to the weekend that we can go out together with out our friends to spend time together. He replied with well I come home to you everyday during the week and we watch movies and hangout. And one time I wasn't going out and he was just going over to his new friends house to practice in the band and I asked to go and he said NO I should just stay home. We argued about it but he still went alone.

I just feel like he spends to much time with his friends. I'm not trying to make him never see them but I want us to ""DATE"".

When my wife and I first started dating, she got pregnant within a few weeks. I wasn't satisfied with sticking with my crappy retail job for the next 30 years, so I decided to go back to school. To the horror of my extended family, I quit my job to focus on being a full-time student. 

It had been a long few years without steady employment, but last summer I got a job working part-time as a work-study at my college. This January, however, that also fell through and I was left completely unemployed. I was forced to apply for food stamps and things got pretty dark. I also found out that due to an advising hiccup, I was going to be forced to attend another quarter to graduate because I needed to take another few math classes.

For the last of my technical courses I was going to have to do an unpaid internship at a place about an hour away. With no income, I was uncertain how I was going to be able to afford to do it.

Last week was when the insanity began. I found out that in an unprecedented move, the place I was interning at was going to give me a gas allowance. A few days later, my best friend texted me and told me to send my resume to his supervisor, apparently they had an unexpected opening. Later that day, one of the chairs of IT at my school emailed me and said that my math situation had been resolved. They're accepting a class I took as all the math requirements for my degree, meaning that I'm once again back on track for a spring graduation!

Several days and a few interviews later, I was called with a job offer. I start tomorrow as a network technician, and my internship begins this week as well. I'm really looking forward to working off my debts and being able to support my family again.

g8iof,1,2011-03-21,Unemployed 24 year old American with a degree from a top tier University,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g8iof/unemployed_24_year_old_american_with_a_degree/,"I am 24 years old, graduated a top tier university in 2009 with a degree in Finance. I have been stuck interning for 8 months at a boutique finance firm aka not a top tier bank. I have applied to over 50 different jobs, with little to no response. I had a high GPA and played college athletics, which also means I never did an internship during college and have no work experience besides what I do now. My internship will not be leading to a future job.

I watch the news, CNBC, read articles about the job market, or lack there of and everyone says it is coming back and this is proved by the ""numbers"". I want to say that is 99% false. I have come to realize that during the recession many large companies were forced to cut their workforces in order to continue doing business. This allowed companies to run at ultimate efficiency and survive the recession, but after that companies started seeing record profits, basically doing what they were doing before but with much less people.

Now, you hear about ""We are out of the recession, we need more jobs, bla bla bla"" and companies replying ""We are vastly growing and we plan to add more jobs"". Here is the reality, if you listen closely almost every company will say they are growing, but WHERE are they growing. The answer is overseas. So in other words they are expanding their businesses and operations overseas, so yes they are hiring, but NOT in America, unless you speak Russian, Mandarin, Portuguese or Arabic. The hot button term is ""emerging markets"".

So, this leaves me as an overqualified, underpaid and extremely frustrated American, who grew up eager to make my own American Dream. I guess there are jobs out there, bad ones in my mind, or better yet ""bridge"" jobs that can bridge the gap from bad to good and good to great. 

I am the only one who feels this way? Why did I go to college? Why did I try in college? Why do I even apply to these jobs on these websites for companies, when nobody is looking anyway? Are things really changing or are things actually getting worse, but just masked by all the money being thrown around by the Federal Reserve and the Government to distract Americans from the harsh reality?

It really is amazing how fast you can go from being in such a wonderful place in life with everything going so well to how shitty you can feel in a matter of moments. For me the high lasted for about a month, and the low feels like its just beginning.

About a month ago things really started looking up for me. Everything was going well at my university, I was single and loving it. I had living arrangements with one of my best friends who happens to be a girl (i'm a guy), Sports we're going well, my mom was recovering from her surgery, I feel strong, confident, friendly, and held my shoulders a little higher as I walked around. My roommate and I called the feeling ""swag"". That little extra pizazz you have when you feel so good you look around and feel like any challenge can be taken on no matter what. I had my swag and it felt great.

I guess things started to switch a little as soon as our Spring Break started. Me, my best friend, and my roommate decided to go on a road trip around my home state and the whole thing went really well. Unfortunately, at the end of the trip, I realized that i just spent an extra 10 days with my roommate which is cool cause we always got along well, but we never got the separation that we normally get. As soon as we got back to the University, he seems to have left the house a little and i will go days without talking more than a sentence or two to him. Another one of my best friends jumps back to his X (which is an awful idea for him but he's blinded by sex and doesn't notice its killing him on the inside). I try and get him to notice but he just can't see it.

My professor who told me he thought i could get a job in my home town talked to the businesses he knew and so far I haven't heard anything positive back from them along with any companies i talked to regarding job positions or internships, something that I need to have for this summer. Running out of time...

On top of the rest of it, my future roommate and I go out to a party Saturday night which leads to a fooling around session like none that I have ever had before. Long story short- It was awesome. The day after it was like nothing had happened (which i am 100% okay with) and we still were the same friends as we have always been. However, she decided to come over tonight and stay here (she's stayed here with me a lot but we don't ever fool around). Neither of us can sleep, which has happened before, but this time she decided to just get up and leave without saying a word to me. I call to make sure shes alright and she ignores the call. I try to be the bigger person and make sure shes okay and she tells me she doesn't want to talk to me and that she would have started ignoring my texts sooner but she couldn't find parking at her apartment. Kind of a low blow if you ask me.

So 3 best friends no more... not a big deal unless that's all you have at your college (like me.... unfortunately). I can't talk to any of them about the issues since they're all not around or pissed off and its just getting bottled up more and more which at some point will have to explode. I wish i could go talk to my friends I have here, but they never seem to understand where I'm coming from on issues like this which is why my best friends are my best friends. I can honestly say I was never so emotionally upset with life as i was tonight. Something about all of the events happening in such a small amount of time really is getting the best of me. 

Tonight was the first time the thought of doing something horrible to myself crossed my mind... I know i still have my family at home and my friends in other places so that kept it away but not having them and knowing they are there for me... I don't know how people could handle it. Everybody needs to remember that all it takes is one kind gesture and you can really change somebodies life.

Hi Redditors!




What a whirlwind journey it has been. A little over half a year ago, I joined r/starcraft as a bored summer intern trying to find something to browse at work that would look vaguely productive to my employer. What I did not realize is that I would find a vibrant and fast-growing community with enough memes, discussion, and news to occupy me beyond my mind-numbing workday. Then I decided I’d like to give back a little and occupy my free time with organizing events. My first foray into the world of eSports was organizing the SCReddit Open, an event that has doubled in size since its inception, has swelled to a weekly prize pool of ~$200, and regularly enjoys viewership in the thousands.

Frankly, I didn’t expect SCRO to grow at the rate that it did, but as the event became more popular, I realized that eSports is something I really enjoy being a part of—as is creating a source of entertainment and a narrative for the Reddit community. For myself and many of the other people, the motivations behind organizing were and still remain very simple--we want to see eSports grow.

Soon, with the help of a long list of people who shared a similar passion, we formed the SCReddit organizing team, which has since then helped organize a number of regular events, including the popular King of the Hill series. We started as a small and dedicated core of individuals with big ideas and simple means, and through hard work we managed to gain the clout and reputation to put on events this community can be proud of. The team became not about any single person, but the collective making decisions together. To me, the chance to work with individuals of such a high caliber is what this community is all about, and it is to that group that I owe the biggest thanks.

Then there was the SCReddit Invitational. The SCRI represented the perfect storm of passionate, scary-intelligent, and talented people, the full list of whom you can view here: http://screddit.com/invitational/event-staff/ . We got more attention than many thought an amateur-run event could get, more accolades from the scene from the anticipated, and more support from this community than I could ever dream of. I also got a thread about my picture laden with borderline sexual comments that caused my introvert side immense discomfort along with a little bit of me gusta.

It also meant the start of some serious changes for the SCReddit organizing team, which had truly come into its own. All of a sudden we were being courted by big names with big plans, even though at our core we were just a group of Redditors who liked games and probably had too much free time on our hands.

So now we have an organization and plans. Big plans. But unfortunately for myself and the team, which consists of all Redditors, it also means that it is time for us to move on to different endeavors beyond this community, and although we will always be a part of it as readers and participants, we will no longer continue to organize SCReddit events.

The good news is that we have something huge in store for the StarCraft II, and, at the risk of making an announcement of an announcement, I will say that there’s no way you will want to miss out on what we are planning, and you will know about it when it arrives. Yes it is related to NASL. Yes it is related to IGN. Yes, consequences will never be the same.

So this is a goodbye from me personally as an organizer for this community, although I will retain my basic moderation duties for the time being. I haven’t always been the perfect organizer, the most patient administrator, or the nicest person, but I’ve always tried to do right by this community and hopefully everyone enjoyed the fun while it lasted. I hope that I and the team I have worked with will have left a legacy that some other individual or group of individuals will pick up with their own name and event series in the future, and I will always be available to help them in whatever way I can.

Thanks for everything Reddit! We hope you enjoy the final SCRO, which our team has worked hard to put together both as a last hurrah and a thank you to the community that has supported us. We as individuals will always be a part of the Reddit community and look forward to seeing it grow alongside all of you. This is both a bittersweet end and a reinvigorating beginning, and once you hear about what we have moved on to, we hope you will be as excited as we are to see what a group of Redditors can accomplish. 

Peace,

FearGorm and the SCReddit team

g9d6w,11,2011-03-22,What the hell is wrong with me?,whatsthepoint351,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g9d6w/what_the_hell_is_wrong_with_me/,"I used to be a book fiend. I could pick up a book and read for hours straight until I finished it. Nowadays, I normally fall asleep if I try to read twenty pages. I generally also lose interest and stop reading the book after one or two tries.

I used to play in a band, and jam with friends if I was out of a band. I could be counted on to spend several hours a week playing guitar. I can't remember the last time I picked up a guitar.

My favorite part about parties used to be just getting to meet a lot of random people and converse with them. Now I am afraid of parties, I don't feel like I have anything in common with everyone and everything seems intimidating.

I really feel no emotional connection with anything or anyone these days. Everything just exists, if anything there is only despair. I can't cry when I really want to.

And there seems to be no chance for getting better. I'm trying to keep my shit together in school, when I can't put my laundry away within a week or make myself three meals a day. Everytime I meet with my psychiatrist at the student health center, he just ups my dose of Prozac slightly. I don't even know what it does anymore, I feel just like I did when I went in for that first visit. But I do know how horrible things can be if I stop taking it. Last time I abruptly stopped taking it, assuming I could handle everything myself, doctors thought I was bipolar.

I don't even know what I'm asking or trying to say. Everything just seems fucked. Not just me, the world, humanity, etc. There don't seem to be any doctors that can actually help me. There isn't a single psychotherapist available to me under my ""top of the line"" health insurance.

It's not that I want to end my life, I just don't see a point to living. I wake up every day and it seems like a chore just to exist until I can pass out again. I really don't look forward to the rest of my life. For the longest time, I assumed I knew what I wanted to do in life. I recently discovered that I actually have no fucking clue, I just listened to what everyone around me said I should do, and decided that must be the best course of action.

My dream was to join law enforcement or the military, but I imagine my chances for that are completely fucked. Between depression and some lifestyle choices I have made(recreational drug use), I'm pretty sure no agency would even look at me.

Right now I am in CS, because I've always been good with computers. But I don't know if this is really what I want to do in life. Recently, I have been thinking about becoming a doctor, either psychiatry or internal medicine. But I'm already about 2/3 through a degree and committed to an internship for two more semesters, it seems like I am locked in. I don't even know if this is what I really want, I really know nothing about becoming a doctor or med school, or if this is just another stupid fucking desperate impulsive idea.

I just want to give up. I want to set this laptop down, lay in bed, and never get up again."

ga933,5,2011-03-24,[Wanted] A couple of Web or and/iPhone developers for paid internship in Northern Jersey,binarydev,newjersey,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/ga933/wanted_a_couple_of_web_or_andiphone_developers/,"Hey guys, not sure if this is the right place to post this, but since it's a local job thought it would be. My company is looking to hire a few web and/or iPhone developers immediately as paid interns (part time or full time is up to you and your availability) in Northern NJ, specifically in Parsippany, on Route 10. This is usually meant for college students, but if you're looking for some experience or are still in high school and want to learn more about the industry then by all means reach out to me. You just need to be of legal working age, which I think is 14 in NJ. Specifically what we're looking for is someone who fits this criteria:

For a web dev: HTML or XHTML and CSS, if you know JavaScript it helps but that is always easy to learn, and knowledge of PHP, .NET, Ruby on Rails, or any other dynamic language is a plus but not required. There's always time to learn new things. You basically just need to be able to take a Photoshop template and convert it into valid HTML &amp; CSS.

For iPhone/iPad devs: working knowledge of the basics of native Objective-C (simple memory management with retain and release, if else statements, etc.), experience with the XCode Interface Builder applications (XCode 3 is great, XCode 4 is even better but not expected as a requirement), and basic experience of using the iOS framework (even if it was just playing around).

Again, this is an internship, so it is meant to be a learning experience, but if you bring any kind of experience with you already, then it is definitely welcome. Hourly wage depends on experience and motivation to learn more, and it has the possibility to become a full time job.

Our client work usually is a mix of projects for the government, pharmaceutical companies, and small to medium-sized businesses.

If you're interested or have any questions feel free to comment or send me a pm on Reddit. I started out as an intern myself and am now a full time employee on salary while continuing my college education part time, so I'll answer your question the best I can and tell you where to email your resume. Thanks, guys!"
gbkz0,0,2011-03-25,Using iPad 2 for Business,mynameisNEO,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/gbkz0/using_ipad_2_for_business/,"I am doing an IT internship for an engineering company. My boss likes Apple products and he had a crazy idea to buy some iPad 2's to test out the iPad's possible use for business. He thinks that they could replace company laptops for people only needing basic functions. These are my stories. If you have any tips for using iPads for business please comment.

**1) Good luck activating an iPad on a corporate Verizon (or AT&amp;T) account.** 

It has been a mess. My company had no idea how to connect an iPad to 3G. We provided serial numbers and ""meid"" numbers for the iPads to our main mobile contact in another state (corporate HQ). She contacted Verizon support who emailed her this ""Verizon does not currently support the iPad. You must purchase a Mi-Fi device and connect the iPad using Wi-Fi. Sorry for the inconvenience.""  Somebody's customer support scripts need updating.

After a couple days we were told by corporate to activate the iPad's by setting up a prepaid account just like a regular customer would, and expense the cost of one month. Supposedly at some point we will be able to transfer these prepaid accounts to a post-paid account that the mobile people at corporate HQ will handle. The first iPad connected without issue. The second iPad required a new account (meaning new email address and password) but allowed me to use the same credit card for billing that I used for the first iPad. You cannot have more than one prepaid account tied to a Veruzon username/password. The third iPad won't connect period. We thought it was Verizon's servers being overloaded with activations, and now we think it is an iPad problem.

We are waiting for three more iPad's to come in that we will be connecting to AT&amp;T. I hope it is a little smoother process. (It was my boss's idea to try out both carriers.)

**2) What do I do about Apple ID's?**

Right now we are using our personal Apple ID's when setting up these iPads. My concern is what is going to happen when an iPad needs to be assigned to a different employee? Any purchased apps are tied to the Apple ID and can't be transferred. Should I be creating generic Apple ID's for the iPads? I don't know yet, but we could eventually rely heavily on productivity apps like SharePlus ($15) or the Apple productivity apps ($10 each). Not being able to transfer the apps to a different Apple ID concerns me.

**3) Email on the iPad is amazing.** 

I have to hand it to Apple on this one. Using email is great on the iPad. So much better than using Novell GroupWise and an Outlook Web access (its weird but that is the setup that most of us are stuck with here.) Setting up email was a little tricky but that was just because of the mail server setup that my company is using. My boss is loving the email on iPad and I have to agree.

That's it for now. If anyone is interested I will post updates. Part of me wants this experiment to fail so that I can just keep the iPad that I am testing :) There are some things that make me nervous about having to support the iPad. Thank you for any input.

**TL;DR My boss bought some iPad 2's for business use and I thought I would share my experiences so far.**"

I know its a long internship but the circumstances worked out that way.

My question is:

Is there anything I should clear off my computer? I know i'll clear history and simple things like that, but I have paid bills and such on my work computer and I want to know if there is anything that is a bit more through than just clearing history, uninstalling and deleting obvious stuff. Any suggestions no matter how obvious you might think it is would be helpful. Thanks in advance for any advice!

Stats: 
OS: Win 7 Home edition (If you know any win specific tricks)
Browsers Used: Chrome, Firefox.
Also made use of Win 2000 (not sure of edition) on my Virtual machine.

Edit: nothing I want to hide (besides a few programs I made when maybe I shouldn't have). No particular reason in wanting to clear stuff off except for I wanted to know if there were any ""Oh shit you should have known to do that"" rules. First time leaving this type of job and want to do it right."

gc328,1,2011-03-26,How do I get over this defeatist attitude?,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gc328/how_do_i_get_over_this_defeatist_attitude/,"The following is a bit of back story. I will try to be succinct. If you don't give a fuck about my personal problems go ahead and skip to the comments.

Last Spring I went on an internship in my chosen field of study and hated it. However, at the end of my internship I received a job offer. Feeling dissatisfied with my options I decided to take the GRE(Graduate Record Examination). For those who have not heard of the GRE it is the equivalent of the SAT but for graduate school.

Three weeks ago I took the GRE and did well enough that I believe I can do anything. It has always been a secret desire of mine to go to film school. Looking back I wish I had had the balls to apply to an undergraduate production program or two. Most MFA production programs require some sort of portfolio as part of the application process; UCLA being the notable exception. Luckily I received a fairly substantial (for me) tax return this year. It was a very tough decision to spend so much money in one place, but I decided to spend most of it on a semi-professional HD camera.

The camera finally arrived three days ago. I had been tooling around with it the last couple days; playing with settings and practicing different types of shots. The camera was amazing, I loved everything about it. I already ordered a larger battery (The internet said it helped with stabilizing shots as well). 

I went camping this weekend and took the camera with me. Friday afternoon I hiked up to the site on the plateau where I had been planning to set up camp. I was the only person up there. I left my pack at the campsite and wandered around for an hour getting a couple shots with my camera. I started to get nervous about camping alone towards the late afternoon. I decided to hike down to the lower campsite where I had seen a couple tents on my way up. I took the short way back, it was only two miles but fairly steep and unfamiliar terrain. It took me nearly an hour. I got down there a little before 6 and set up my tent.

There was still a decent amount of light but there was some cloud cover rolling in. I was worried about it raining overnight so I asked the couple camping nearest to me to watch my tent. I loaded my camera and about half my food into the detachable bag on my backpack. I left everything else at the campsite and hiked a little less than a mile back to my car.

This morning, not long after I had gotten out of my tent, word made its way back to our campsite that about half the cars in the parking lot had been broken into. Of course mine was one of them.

I know whoever broke into my car was probably a lot poorer than I am. I know they were elated to find such expensive electronics in an otherwise nondescript car. I just wish they knew how much that camera meant to me. I know it is just a material object and I shouldn't be so upset, but I feel crushed. It was the embodiment of my objective. I feel like all my hope has been ripped away.

Even before my camera was stolen I had been feeling pressure to take the job from family and friends. It is a good job in a well-respected industry. Even the pay isn’t that bad. My friends think I’m crazy. My girlfriend says all the right things, but I know she thinks I should take the job. The pressure from my dad is the worst. I don’t understand why he can’t see my viewpoint. His story closely parallels mine. I went to the same state college he did and got the same degree he did. He hated it too and switched to a much more creative (and at the time groundbreaking) field. Now I’m sitting at my computer and I’ve somehow made myself cry in God knows how long. I feel trapped. I just want to give up and take the job.

When I started typing this up it was a story about feeling down after getting my camera stolen. I delved deeper into my psyche than intended. I don’t consider this a bad thing, but it ended up being much longer than I expect the average redditor to spend time reading. Thank you to everyone who made it this far.

**Tl;dr:** Expensive camera stolen. Feel trapped in job I don’t want. I want words of encouragement/stories about getting back up after life knocked you down. I know reddit isn’t the best place to go fishing for these kinds of things but I don’t really know where else to go."

Background: broke up beginning of Feb. she said, ""couldn't handle being in a relationship right now."" and to be honest, she was dealing with a lot. Anyway, I didn't really ask questions about why/when/how ect. because I didn't want to pressure her or further deteriorate the relationship. 

Fast-forward 2 frustrating months to today, what woulda been 3 yr. anniversary, and I really dont give a fuck about what affect asking those questions would have, but would still like the answers. so im thinkin about sending this message: 

I don’t know if you remember what today is, but I have been thinking about you and us a lot.  Don’t worry, this is not a, “Happy anniversary baby, I love you, please take me back” message so please continue reading. Basically, there’s just a lot of stuff I’d like to talk about with you. I don’t expect or want to have this convo today or very soon; I would rather finish up my internship, go on my vacation, and have it after I return and visit so we can be face 2 face.

Just wanted to know what Reddit thinks, and if I should add/remove anything.

gdfny,0,2011-03-28,I am the girlfriend of a booking agent boyfriend well on his way to success,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gdfny/i_am_the_girlfriend_of_a_booking_agent_boyfriend/,"When I first met my boyfriend, I never knew what he really did or what it entailed. I never thought that I would have experienced all of the things I had until I met him. We’ve been dating for almost a year (it will be a year next month) and I couldn’t have met a more sincere and genuine guy then him. He is such a hard worker; both at work and when he is with me. Sometimes words can’t express how proud of him I am because he really knocks me off my feet. What my boyfriend does for work is basically “scope” out bands, books them, and then contacts venues to book them for shows. When my boyfriend was a teenager, he started up a booking agency with another guy in his state. They would put on shows at local venues and draw in kids each night. Not too soon after, he began an internship at a marketing agency. It wasn’t until a couple months later that he was offered a job at a booking agency where he still works today. My boyfriend is very lucky in that where he works there are only two other guys who work with him. His boss is very well known, kind, and is even good friends with Travis Barker.  Many of the bands that my boyfriend books consist of metal bands although, he also books a rapper, DJ, pop and alternative bands. Two of the bands he books have been on Vans Warped Tour and one is currently on the 2011 Vans Warped Tour.  His bands have been on magazines, headlined shows, and one of them is extremely liked by the singer of Korn.

Some of the things I’ve been able to experience with my boyfriend have been amazing. Just this past weekend I went to Brooklyn, NY and met the creator of Warped Tour. At every concert my boyfriend puts on, I am able to go backstage with him and meet every band member. Sometimes at shows I get free beer or get to hang out with the band on their tour bus. I have met so many tour managers, booking agents, and merch. people I can’t even remember all of their names. A couple people my boyfriend works for have even become good friends to me including the singer of a band, the owner of a company, and many more. One thing I have begun to notice is that people who work in the music industry are so kind and will always give me a hug or remember who I am. When I was in high school I used to be so shy but now I have really come out of my shell because of meeting all of these important people and creating friendships with them. Also, it is cool being able to walk backstage at a sold out concert and watch the show from literally the best seat in the house. I know kids are probably very jealous of us but I am so lucky to have a boyfriend who does what he does. He not only wants to bring me along to all his shows but also show people who I am and how much he loves me.

Lastly, although being a booking agent sounds like it‘s all just fun and games, it can be serious hard work. Sometimes people will call him at 12am at night just to ask a question they could have waited to ask in the morning. Sometimes my boyfriend’s bands won’t get paid when they should have and then all hell breaks loose. There have been times when my boyfriend has lost a band or a band has broken up and I have felt so bad for him. Sometimes when I wish he could have been with me, he’s had to go to a concert instead to ensure his band doesn’t drop him and go with a different agent. There have even been times where he has had to travel to California or Texas for business meetings and I couldn't come. Through it all though, it has been a roller-coaster experience thus far and I can’t wait to see where my boyfriend will be 5 or 10 years from now. I know he will be very successful in life and everyone who works with him knows that as well.

I was wondering if anyone knows any of any jobs available in the Austin/SM area that are for Sys Admin/Network Admin internships. I am looking to keep expanding my resume for when I graduate, and I can't seem to find any solid companies that are offering good internships (read NOT Tech Support). 

I have tons of experience (8 years in the field, ~3 in Sys Admin type positions) and am really looking for a job that might offer opportunities once school has finished. 

Anyone have any ideas or leads that they could point me to?

Thanks!"

I attended Ole Miss at the age of 17, since my parents were not drug addicts, extremely poor, neglectful, or horrible people...in the south I was not able to get any scholarships even with B's and A's in High School.  The only scholarships I had were a few randoms for 500$ here, 250$ there...and a scholarship from Wizards of the Coast from when I played MTG.  All together maybe 3k$ in funds.  

Tuition was never a problem from a loan perspective, id be around 30k or so in debt by end of run in school.  The main reason I dropped out was I felt the system of college was bastardized.  I was paying to take classes that I had already taken in High School for the first 2 years, followed by advanced classes that had nothing to do with my profession, followed by maybe 8 classes that had to do with my field, it didn't seem good to me.  There was more but that is a story for another time.  

So, I left school and started working odd jobs, trying to find a internship and got lucky.  I got in the door working cheap for a company and developed internal sites.  I taught myself everything I know today by doing them to fix real problems that arose and absorbed as much as I could from others in my dept. 

After 2 years there the economy sank and they fired a lot of people (280+ employees down to about 30).  I was forced to look for work and with the mass influx of people of similar fields looking for work, I took about 6 months off trying to find work.  I finally found a job in another city about 3 hours from my home town and moved out on my own now having just turned 21.  I have been here for about a year and love the new city, my new job and am proud to have been a self taught person in my field.  

I specialize in Web Design (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc) and have experience in Flash.  I am also self taught in Graphics Design (PS, Fireworks, etc) as it pertains to my job, and in both cases my development is not only for public facing web sites but for internal Share Point platforms as well.  I started on SP 2003 and have been working with it all through 2007 and now 2010.

Mari was in my city for an internship for a few months and I met her through friends.  We started as friends and had an amazing time but we only really got together the last week or so.  We spent her last day here together...I felt really happy.

After she left for home/Europe, we kept in touch for about 4 months with solid emails.  But eventually after she got a new job, we emailed less.  Once a while when I didn't email (feeling that she lost interest), she would initiate it again but then it stopped again.

Last month I told her I was going to visit and would like to see her.  It took her awhile to respond back and I knew her level of interest waned. I am visiting her and some other mutual friends next month. However, she wrote in an email that she wants to stay friends (I hate this) and felt weird if I stayed at her place.  She, however, found me a place with one of her friends to stay.  

The problem is I'm still hung up on her…but I know how she feels.  And even though she isn't the goal of the entire trip, I can't just lie to myself by saying she's not an important reason for me to go on this trip.  I'll see other friends in Europe, but I mainly did want to see her.  

Knowing what I know now, it hurts and I'm feeling a little embarrassed actually.  I don't know what to expect or how to be with her now.  I have feelings for her obviously but I can't push it more than that.  I would like it to continue but I don't know if she'll reciprocate.  If she does, I'll be happy…but if she doesn't I'll just feel like this trip is a waste.  

It's a stupid question, but what do I do when I see her?  She was more than a friend and I would love to have her as a friend, but I don't know if I can go back to that…

I've been thinking of her a lot.  I know I should not and let her go, but it's been difficult.

**TLDR:** Hooked up with a girl this summer, she went home, I still like her a lot. Visiting Europe and will see her soon, but she wants to be friends.  "
gdl29,1,2011-03-28,Coping with a breakup by training a RAW 23 yr old virgin to be a freak.. gets worse...,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gdl29/coping_with_a_breakup_by_training_a_raw_23_yr_old/,"Worth the read, I’m not beat… but I need advice

My life… Moved to a cool town right outside THE city, met this awesome girl, dated her for like 3 months.. Did the Rockafella Christmas tree thing, flowers delivered to her office on Valentines day and dinner… still hadn’t fucked her because she said she doesn’t do that until she’s in a serious relationship w someone – which was new for me but I dug it cuz I hate sluts, she's an awesome person to be around, and she gave the best head I’ve ever got.  Didn’t see her for a month after Vday cuz she’s constantly busy, always having family excuses on wknds and she works until around 8:30 every week day… she still hit me up everyday though, but eventually I had to let it slide.. things faded I guess.. she said she needed time to “find herself” and that she “tends to back off when she finds herself starting to actually like someone because she’s been hurt before but really does like hanging out w me and genuinely thinks im a great guy” – fuck that.  Dueces.  But I still think she’s awesome so I’ll let her have her “time.” I’ve avoided her, not responded to her texts, and not playin the friend card anymore.  For a long time I wasn’t sleeping at all, drank a lot, and smoked so many cigs that my throat hurt.  Finishin my last pack and quiting for a while cuz real people don’t smoke, I need to get my shit together and maybe “find myself” also…

What I’ve done since then…
The worst night of not sleeping and being depressed over this girl that I got really into, was the night before a job interview at 9am.  Slept about 2 hours on the couch, pounded a coffee and a 5 hour energy and went to the interview not really giving a fuck and let my swagger fly off the meat rack like a BOSS.  Started hooking up with an intern at my current job, only to find out she’s a 23 year old college grad virgin.  She’s not bad looking, but not smokin either – kinda reminds me of the episode of Seinfeld where Jerry dates a woman who looks good in normal lighting but in the wrong lighting can look like a grenade.  Turns out intern has never even given head or even touched a dick before (found this out when she had to sleep over after the office Christmas party because she missed the last train back home).  Long story short, I got her the internship without even knowing her so we became friends and do the gchat thing at work cuz I hate my job and am usually bored.  So to get my mind off the girl I was dating, I started hangin out with virgin whenever I was bored enough and horny enough to want a blowjob (her first time ever took her an hour and 20 minutes of hardcore coaching on my part to bust my nut – I warned her to swallow and not make mess several times but it ended up all over her tits, hair, face, hands, and my chest – bitch.) I had no idea you could suck dick at literally sucking dick.  Next time I just got on top and face fucked her and made sure it went down with no mess.  Past Friday night she texts me, “I’m drunk, I wana play” to which I responded, “what do you wana play with?” to which she responded, “your dick ;)” I told her to “come over on Sunday and to get a haircut, ya dig?? ;)” (up until  now I hadn’t ventured down there that much cuz I could feel bush from a distance and didn’t wana start a forest fire)  Movie and bottle of wine, got to finger blastin and made this virgin squeal like a pig at a bacon factory.  Wanted to fuck her cuz she was so tight I could only get 1 finger in, but she wants a relationship to be having sex w someone, I told her we’r friends w benefits cuz we work together and accepted a Russian roulette BJ by letting her blow me.  I put some porn on my laptop (her first porn experience also) and prayed for a quick and clean BJ.  20-30 minutes later and a premature release on her part left her in the bathroom for 15 minutes cleaning cum out of her hair while I smoked a cig.  That night I had a dream about my grandma that had died of cancer about a year ago and all my family members in the dream were really sad.  I spoke at her funeral mass and even carried her coffin in real life– never shed even half a tear to this day over it, even though I was very close with and loved her very much.  She was the kind of person that taught me to be mentally strong – as weak as I can see a lot of you might think it is.  *My alarm goes off at 730 for virgin and I to go to work and she proceeds to tell me I was twitching and talking in my sleep all night and even whimpering/half crying like her dog does sometimes.  WTFFF??  I really think I might have a problem…
If you knew me, I’m the kind of athletically jacked person that if all you bitches turned into zombies, I’d be out there roaming the streets with a fucking machete and a shotgun doin work!  I don’t cry for anything – although I can relate that feeling getting turned down by the girl I was dating but I turned to the gym even harder to fight that.  Also, I don’t know what I would do without music… Keeps me going.  

I’ve got a second interview on Thursday for the job interview I went on with no sleep and cracked out on 5 hour energy, so im hoping for the best.  I still think about the one girl I really wish I was still hanging out with cuz shes unlike any girl iv ever met and I don’t know what to do.  At the same time, I’m not gona chase a ghost.  I’m just doin me for now, sleeping again, being very productive, making money and moves, and enjoying life but I keep thinking about how it could be better… 

Long Story Short – got dumped, drank/smoked/didn’t sleep a lot, turned virgin intern into a freak in order to forget about girl 1, focusing on getting a new job, working out a lot and (ZMA pills for muscle recovery and great sleep), quit smoking cigs, music.  Still not satisfied with life even though in the grand scheme of things – it’s good…  

Someone say something useful….

geunp,0,2011-03-30,How do I forgive myself?,throwaway039483,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/geunp/how_do_i_forgive_myself/,"23F, ex is 23M, we were together for 6 years.

I ended my relationship in late December/early January.  I had been unhappy for a very long time, we fought all the time, I never felt appreciated or good enough, I had trouble communicating and staying honest, he was at times too critical, and I think we both let other relationships fall by the wayside to make ours work.  And it just wasn’t working.  We had grown apart (been together since high school, went to college together), and we were just going through the motions, stubborn in our own behaviors, offering no compromise on anything.

I went about it really poorly.  I knew I was unhappy, I knew that I wanted to end it, but I wanted to wait until we were both home for winter break, me from my internship, him from school.  We had been long distance (about 4 hours), for 4 months.  Unfortunately, my emotional state, and my ex’s need for total transparency, led to me breaking down and ending it prior to coming home - prior to my final intern project and prior to his final exams.  I needed space but he wanted to prove that he could be different, that he could change, and space wasn’t given to me.  I lashed out, behaved inappropriately and said and did some really terrible things to my ex that I truly regret.  He says I ruined his life.  He was unable to take some of his exams and he had to drop a class this semester.  I never wanted that to happen, I just lost control and I know I behaved so selfishly :(

I realize now that a lot (but not all) of the frustration I took out on my ex was transferred from other frustrations in my life, and I realize that a good relationship can exist if we both want it and are willing to work at it.  I am in therapy, working to better myself as an individual, but my ex has now accepted that he is happy with himself and that he doesn’t have to change.  He isn’t a bad guy, in fact he can be pretty great, but once I lashed out, his ability (or want) to change went out the window.  Despite the fact that I took a lot of external frustration out on him, I did have legitimate concerns with him which led to the break up.  Now, because of my post-break up freak out, I feel like I am not entitled to feel anything about his role in the relationship, past or present.

On top of that, I feel like I am continually being defined by my past mistakes.  I know that what I did was wrong, that how I went about the breakup was awful, but that isn’t who I feel that I am deep down and know that I can be a better person and a better partner.  I know that he can’t forgive me at this point, that the hurt I caused is too great and that it will take some time, but how do I forgive myself?  I don’t want to ignore what I did, I take responsibility, but I feel like I can’t grow with the burden of my mistakes latched to my back.  I certainly have flaws, but I am working on a daily basis to better myself as a person and become someone I can be proud of and happy with.  I am not a bad person, I am not crazy.  I went through a really rough time and behaved in the worst way.  I recognize what I did, and I take full responsibility for my actions, I just don’t want to define myself or allow others to define me by this experience.

I do truly care about my ex.  We have been through a lot together, and I am very willing to put in the work necessary to make this work.  I just don’t know how to move forward at this point.

NOTE:  I have already thought long and hard about just cutting ties and being done with the relationship.  I don’t think either of us wants that.  If this is going to be over, I want it to be over knowing that I gave it my all, and the last couple years have not been me giving my all.  The damage may be too great for us to ever be together again, but I am going to fight for it until that is made clear."

",twilliams413,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ges94/from_oxford_university_to_entrepreneurship/,"Hey Everyone!
 
I’m a guest blogger for the next few weeks! 
 
My name is Tommy Williams and I’m a Business Development intern at GrouPAY. Growing up in the internet/technology age you get used to a somewhat celebrity status for the great entrepreneurs. Many of them such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are household names and feature heavily in the world’s rich lists. There’s a new era with younger Internet entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerburg and Daniel Ek forcing their way into modern culture. 
 
Being a student at Oxford University you’re sold a certain career path. Most students pursue careers in Investment Banking, Corporate law and Management Consultancy; having interned at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and KPMG myself it’s something, which I’ve considered. I recently went to watch The Social Network and saw the rise of Mark Zuckerburg and started reading stories about these entrepreneurs and how they went about their respective journeys. It seems cheesy to say my interest was sparked from a film but it was definitely a catalyst. Everyone you speak to says that being your own boss is the most rewarding feeling in the world, which does makes sense. It is certainly something I would like to do. In the current times it is emphasized how important enterprise and innovation is to ignite growth. David Cameron unveiled Start Up Britain today an initiative modeled on Start Up America (http://www.startupamericapartnership.org/) created by 8 UK based entrepreneurs and is backed by huge companies such as Google, o2 and Barclays to encourage and support entrepreneurs. It seems as though a second bounce is coming and I wanted to find out a bit more myself. 
 
Interning at GrouPAY is my first hands on experience in entrepreneurship in a hands on way and I hope all of you will enjoy following my journey over the next few weeks. Whether you’re a student unsure about your career or a potential customer of GrouPAY I’m sure it will be exciting!

First post here. I am a Junior at a large private university. I have just accepted a summer internship in the audit practice at one of the Big4. While I am not too concerned with the internship, I was hoping to gain some perspective about the Big4 as a whole, and some of my goals for the future. 

My current plan is to work the audit side for around 2-3 years. From there I would like to go to law school. Is this advisable/acceptable?

I currently have formed a relationship with a partner at the firm who has agreed to be my mentor, how can I continue develop this relationship? What should I be asking during the internship?

How does ascending in the firm work, how long does it take to make Manager etc.?

Any other advice you would give to me would be greatly appreciated!

gegkx,2,2011-03-30,"YMCA is the owner of teen center/music venue, KTUB, and is breaching their contract which will put at risk youth even more at risk.",ISaySmartStuff,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/gegkx/ymca_is_the_owner_of_teen_centermusic_venue_ktub/,"My dear friend, who works at Ground Zero Teen Center in Bellevue [which is a teen center and music venue], just e-mailed me about YMCA and what they are doing to an important place in Kirkland.  KTUB [Kirkland Teen Union Building] is a teen center and music venue that has served at-risk and underprivileged youth in the Kirkland area for over 10 years.  Now YMCA is/has been making changes even though they have a contract.  Among these changes:

* Pay cuts to all of the staff.

* Getting rid of teen internships, art/music programs, shows for the next couple months and not paying the paid interns anymore.

* As of April 5^th the **entire** staff will be out of jobs.

* At which point they will close for two weeks.  They are closing a place where teens go when they don't have anywhere to go after school; essentially putting these teens on the streets.

Here is the full e-mail:

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;Most of you are familiar with The Kirkland Teen center, if you are not then look into it....
&gt;
&gt;http://www.allagesmovementproject.org/venues/ktub
&gt;
&gt;This place has been a key player in the All-Ages Music community for the last 10+ years in the eastside, and is a fantastic drop in center for teens and at risk youth to go to as a safe haven.
&gt;
&gt;Every teen center in the Eastside shares funding through a partnership between the city and an organization. KTUB used to be managed by Friends of Youth, but about 5 months ago was taken over by the Bel-Red branch of the YMCA due to lack of funds. During the new merger the City of Kirkland agreed with the YMCA, under a signed contract, that the transition would be as smooth as possible stating that there would be no staffing/programing changes without consent from the city. WELL... that didn't last. Currently the ENTIRE KTUB STAFF is jobless thanks to that organization as of April 5th.
&gt;
&gt;Essentially what has happened, in a very summed up way, was a breach in contract on the YMCA front in deciding without consent or reasoning to the staff, to lay off everyone and completely re-format the programming of KTUB. This means that they eliminated ALL of the teen internships, art/music programs (including a silkscreen studio, paid cafe and sound tech positions, recording studio, and various other internships/programs), all the upcoming all-ages shows for the next several months, and refused to pay contracted interns who have been working for KTUB previous to the YMCA involvement. Beyond that, they lowered wages and hours for all the employees and decided to eliminate the specialty programs to cater towards a more well groomed teen crowd (can't have all the at risk kids stinking up the place), they also ALLOWED the current staff to re-apply for new position at a significant pay cut and no guarantee at a job. On April 5th they are closing doors for two weeks to reformat and hire new employees, leaving the at risk youth in the park/streets where the Kirkland Police are cracking down on a new rise in Heroin usage/dealing among teens. GO YMCA! GO! This is just scratching the surface on the way the staff/kids/building have been treated in the last five months.
&gt;
&gt;I honestly can't speak enough for the current (and soon to be former) staff at KTUB, I consider them all family. They are a constant inspiration to me, and anyone who has worked in a teen center and the entire Seattle/Eastside Youth/All Ages Movement. So this issue obviously hits very close to home with me... being that I would not be where I am if it weren't for places like KTUB and people like the KTUB staff.
&gt;
&gt;Being a Teen Center employee myself I can’t stress how important the staff is to the foundation of the Teen Center. The Teens who have built up trust and relationships with each of the current staff will most likely turn their backs to KTUB, leaving a huge issue with servicing at risk youth in the city of Kirkland. Not to mention the destruction of the Music/Art communities of teens in Kirkland who relied on KTUB as a hub for finding their own and sharing creativity.
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure you are asking, ""..What can I do?"" Well here is the answer: There will be a meeting held for KTUB at the Kirkland City Hall on April 5th at 7:30pm for the KTUB staff to present their case of discrepancies with the YMCA. We are trying to send a message to the City by packing that room and making them understand that KTUB is part of a greater community and greater message here in Western Washington. If you have ever played a teen center show, support the idea of a teen center, been to KTUB/Ground Zero/The Old Firehouse, had any association with all ages music in the Northwest, know/are/have been a teen center employee, attended a teen center, hate the Bel-Red YMCA, love non-profits, want to stick up for the little guy... you should attend this meeting. Everyone else should attend if you live in the greater Seattle area on the grounds that this is YOUR community making community decisions, and YOU should be involved with that.
&gt;
&gt;I hope to see you all there.

**TL;DR:** 

YMCA is breaching their contract and harming a community.  To help teens out, come to the Kirkland City Hall on **April 5^th at 7:30 PM**.  Please help preserve the community and what they have done for Kirkland teens and musicians over the last 10 years.

If you support teens, helping teens and at risk youth and/or all-ages music, please help by attending or spreading the message.

Thank you."

Over the past few months, I have been making strides to make the Atlus Wikia (http://atlus.wikia.com) a better place, increasing the information on the site from 15 pages to 170+ pages, even if a lot of them are placeholders.  As a full-time college student along with working and having an internship, I no longer have the time to be on the site as often as I used to be.  

As such, I would like to make a formal request for help getting back on track.  I feel as though if I were not the only person working on the site, I would be more willing and ready to fill out more information on the large amount of games released by Atlus and Atlus U.S.A..  Any sort of help would be welcome, even if it was in terms of helpful suggestions (other than ""stop working on that crappy site""), especially if anyone had their own images or Youtube videos to submit.  The only thing I do not wish for it to turn into is a wikia dedicated to a specific title, such as the only fully formed page being Demon's Souls or Nocturne, as I would like the wikia to stay revolving around Atlus games as a whole, all 150+ of them.

Again, if anyone is able to help, I thank you in advance.  Also, if anyone has any helpful suggestions, I thank you as well.

gfhip,5,2011-03-31,Open-Source Software Course at uWaterloo,divad12,opensource,https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/gfhip/opensource_software_course_at_uwaterloo/,"Hi Reddit, we have a group of students at uWaterloo interested in a course where students contribute to open-source software. 

&gt;The course:
&gt;1. Upper-year CS elective (possibly core SE course) open to Math, CS, and certain Engineering programs at the University of Waterloo.
&gt;2. First two lectures introduces OSS (history, licenses, major projects), followed by a week of selecting and applying to projects.
&gt;3. There would be a dashboard where the OSS community posts projects and students apply. For example, Google Summer of Code - http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/list_projects/google/gsoc2010
&gt;4. The majority of the course (say, 10 weeks) would be working on the project.
&gt;5. There might be a final presentation or report.
&gt;6. Lectures (less hours than other courses) would be hosted by a prof experienced in OSS and may also consist of guest speakers (we need to get Torvalds or Stallman).
&gt;7. Lectures will be focused on contribution tips, software practices, techniques, and tools.
&gt;8. Part of each lecture is devoted to talk about the projects, seeking help from others, and open discussion among students.
&gt;9. Biweekly, students give a 2-minute presentation on what they've done.
&gt;10. Grading could be based on git commit logs, patches, weekly snippets (what was done this week, what needs to be done next week), email correspondence, and possibly a final report.
&gt;11. Would be a very flexible and open-ended course. Students could contribute code, documentation, bug fixes, participate in a mailing list.
&gt;
&gt;Rationale:
&gt;1. Students can work on exciting projects like Firefox, Chromium, Apache, CPython, WordPress, etc. that have impact in school.
&gt;2. Students learn skills relevant to co-op and the software industry.
&gt;3. Students could get an internship or full-time offer based on their contributions.
&gt;4. Is very relevant to real software engineering.
&gt;5. Being a course means that students can earn a credit and have course time to work on OSS.
&gt;6. Students gain experience and put OSS on their resumes.
&gt;7. Upon graduation, uWaterloo students gain another edge over other students in the job market.
&gt;8. Some of the best programmers have participated in the OSS community.
&gt;9. Students learn software development practices, tools, and techniques, and have their code reviewed (like co-op).
&gt;10. Students gain exposure in the online community and build up a portfolio.
&gt;11. Students who wish to contribute but don't have the time or commitment to do it by themselves can receive guidance, mentorship, a network of peers, and a semi-structured course to assist them.
&gt;12. Soft Eng has a design project where students work collaboratively on a programming project by themselves. CS needs something practical, hands-on like this.
&gt;13. Develop a ""hacker"" community among programmers at Waterloo, like how VeloCity is Waterloo's entrepreneurial hub. Students meet and interact with other coders.
&gt;14. Waterloo would be better known in the software world.
&gt;15. Waterloo promotes itself as being innovative and risk-taking. This would likely be a unique course for which Waterloo could be a world leader.
&gt;16. The programming community (including CS students) who make use of OSS should give back.
&gt;17. This course could be a lot of fun!
&gt;
&gt;For the pilot, we plan to get up to about 30 very motivated students who want to do this. This way, the University does not need to worry about lack of enrollment. Initially, to gain momentum, the faculty should reach out and find mentors/project owners who would be willing to try this out.


Do you have any advice on how our school can connect with the open-source community, and get this started? How can we get mentors to sign up (like Google Summer of Code)? Would it be possible to get sponsors?

EDIT: Our Software Engineering administrator has accepted this proposal (in 8 hours!), as a course through UCOSP (http://ucosp.ca/)."
