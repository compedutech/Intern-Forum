Need an outside perspective from the smart people of reddit… sorry if it’s long I just really need some advice.

I (21,f) have been talking to this man (30) since about the beginning of June. I am interning at the office he works at. Since the first time we met I just felt an instant connection with him, and in the first couple of weeks of seeing each other around at work he asked me to grab a couple beers with him after work one day. Since that first time grabbing drinks, we have texted everyday after work (usually all night, and occasionally talk on the phone but I’m not much of a phone person it’s kind of a stretch that we text so much) and see each other usually everyday at work when we’re not extremely busy. We constantly flirt with each other, we hang out about once a week (we both ask each other to hang out) and we constantly discuss our sexual attraction to each other. 

So the problem… In my mind I have been sending pretty clear signals to him that I am in to him, but I’m sure that is not in fact the case because everyone always thinks their actions are clear. I have tried telling him that I am very interested in him (he already knows I’m interested in him sexually) but every time I bring it up he says ‘well you're definitely not too young for me, but why would you want to be with someone who is 30 and already settled in when you have so many goals you want to achieve after you graduate college’ (which will be in the spring of 2012). My response to that (this was about a month ago) was that it does kind of freak me out that he’s 30 but that you can’t help who you’re interested in and if it’s right then everything else will always work itself out. We haven’t talked about it since, but we still act very flirty with each other and discuss our sexual tension. I was tentatively planning on telling him exactly how I felt once my internship was over (he could get in a lot of trouble dating an intern), I never like to plan things out so I just assumed we’d make dinner one night and I would just come out and tell him, very go with the flow type thing. 

Now the real kicker… yesterday I overheard him telling one of our coworkers that he asked her niece out (who our coworker’s been trying to set him up with all summer and he told me about it a month or 2 ago and said he had no interest in asking her out). Then he told me about the date he is going on when we went out to lunch yesterday because it was obvious I had overheard and after work I texted him and told him that I think about him constantly and really just want to get it on with him, and his response was “So when are you going to make a move then?” Do you think I waited too long to tell him how I really feel or do you think I just misread all his signals he was sending me and he actually wasn’t in to me in the first place? My fellow interns and I all got the distinct impression that he was very interested in me, he would go out of his way to ask me to hang out, go out of his way to call and text me, and was overly flirtatious and touchy-feely with me. We have very deep conversations and tell each other things that we wouldn’t tell just anyone. Guys don’t just do that with girls who are friendzoned, do they? I wouldn’t say I’m the most gorgeous girl in the whole world, but I’m definitely attractive with a decent body, have a love for life and I’m pretty laid back and relaxed… I just don’t understand why he would lead me on like that or what it even means that he asked someone else out on a date. 

Sorry if this makes me sound so immature I just have never been involved with anyone who is older than me and don’t know how their mindset works. Another thing that might be a helpful detail… He’s divorced and his wife cheated on him so I think he has some insecurities. I know I wrote a novel already but if you need anymore details I'll be happy to share them. 


UPDATE!!!: well I texted him after work and told him to have fun on his date and that I wish he were taking me on a date instead so we could have a little fun after ;). that text sparked ""the talk"" and it turns out he does feel the same way as I do but didn't have the guts to tell me. Thank you so much reddit for giving me the confidence to make the first move, I have never done that before. Now we are going out on a real date in the near future!!  Your advice was so amazing.

k227n,3,2011-09-01,Mid-College Crisis,astudentthrowaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/k227n/midcollege_crisis/,"Sorry... to preserve some anonymity, I will have to be a bit vague.

I was born and brought up outside the US. Was a shy kid throughout school, and didn't get much attention from my teachers. However, I did well in many national and international science competitions, and a lot of outside learning and side projects outside school. I felt school was hell, and found no point in staying in my home country. I considered it to be a police state, and thought (rightly so) that I'd end up working long and meaningless hours if I remained there.

Fortunately, my parents were liberal enough and had the resources to put me in a top university in the US. When I came, I thought it was great. I took senior and graduate level classes as a freshman, got to learn a lot from professors and some graduate students -- made friends with few of them and helped them out with their research. Also attended many talks and events from companies and learned a lot from some great people, while retaining a high GPA.

Now, when I tried to apply for internships for two summers straight, I got rejected every single time, and this is in a supposedly ""booming"" field. And I know I'm better than the ones who got accepted. It might be because of my ""poor communication skills,"" or in other words maybe they do not feel like eventually having to sponsor a foreigner? I'm scared now, because I'll get kicked out of the country if I fail to get a job after graduating and probably end up in some sweatshop back home.

I've also considered pursuing advanced degrees from other top universities, but I had set my sights on a very narrow field in my major so far, and feel that I should try to do something else in my major, particularly because this ""narrow field"" is a very competitive one worldwide. Just looking at the profiles of the research groups for this field scares me. It is also a very mature one, and I feel like I would make myself more useful working on an emerging field.

I'd like to study everything in my major. But, unfortunately, it seems like there is too much to learn. I was sure I knew what to do as a high school student, and I *am* doing that now. However, I would like to gain expertise in it, and it seems like that takes loads of time.

On top of this, I've got what [r/seduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction) would call [oneitis](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=oneitis). (Note: I've never been in a relationship in my life.) During the first class I had at the university, I saw this pretty girl sit right next to me (I never attended lecture again, because I tested out of that class). I used to see her everywhere, but never bothered to say anything. Wasn't all that obsessed back then, though I did somehow find out here Facebook account. But then we were in a class together last semester and I was pleased to find out that she was smart (not super-smart) and really nice. I think she liked me too.

However, that semester has passed by, and during the break I used to stalk her FB profile every day. I saw her once now that the semester has just begun, but I think she doesn't recognize me.

What have I been doing lately? I hang out in the library, around 10 hours a day, working on some projects and learning stuff. It's keeps me hooked at times, but I have been getting distracted due to this ""depression"" lately. I also attend some interesting classes. I also try to get regular exercise and eat healthy. I do feel lonely at times, but I have smart friends I plan to work on side projects with. It's getting increasingly hard to get hold of them though. I also have some saner friends who are drinking buddies, but I would not like to waste too much time partying. About that girl, I have no clue what to do; how to get her out of my head or to get her attention. Either way, I think this obsession is really unhealthy.

I don't know about my future. I'm sure I will graduate a year early. Maybe this whole ""teen entrepreneur"" thing is getting on my nerves. It's like a mid-life crisis -- just more of a ""post-teen crisis."" I do want to make something useful and help others with the skills I have, but I'm not sure how to use this skills for the greater good yet. Maybe going back home would be a better thing to do, but it's incredibly hard to change things there. I always felt the United States is more open to such ideas, though it will take a lot of effort to stay in the country and eventually be able to legally start a business or become a professor.

I can't pinpoint what exactly is the cause of my depression: I'm doing what I want to do right now, something very few people have the fortune of doing. I guess it's probably some combination of what I've described.

TL;DR: Shy foreign student in US, doing pretty well in major and having a deep interest, rejected for internships, scared of getting kicked out of the country, also, girl problems.

k3khq,18,2011-09-03,I feel so lost. Bit of a ramble.,[deleted],polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/k3khq/i_feel_so_lost_bit_of_a_ramble/,"*This post should probably go in r/RelationshipAdvice. I am explicitly posting it here because the second I mention that I have a boyfriend, the focus will be on that and not on my actual problem. There have been a few posts lamenting polyphobia on reddit, and I don't feel like dealing with polyphobia alongside my current issue. Thank you, r/Poly, for being here, and forgive me for bringing my ""regular relationship"" problems to you.*

Fiance and I have been together for 8 years. If you're a reader of r/Poly you've probably seen my other posts, possibly under my other account, and know all this already. We were one another's firsts, and kind of grew up together. We got together in middle school and have been together up through our last semester of College, which is now. Both 22. We've built our lives together and are getting married in two years. And I'm feeling lost and terrified that I have fallen out of love with him. 

He recently came home from a 3 month internship across the country, and while he was gone I tried to enjoy myself and my alone time. Boyfriend and I spent all the time we could together, because we knew we wouldn't get another chance like it, and it was wonderful. Everytime Fiance and I would Skype, I cried a little, because I missed him more than I realized. I felt loving and excited at his return up until the last week or so before it. 

We were both in quite a funk - I think he got something on the plane home - and readjusting to his return. I even made a post about it a while ago. We had very difficult discussions. He's a tall, big guy, and no matter how much I love him, I'm not that physically attracted to him and haven't ever really been. I'm just not. I can't make myself be. But it wasn't always a problem, and I managed. Our sex life before he left was pretty good, actually. We discussed this. He's challenged himself to lose weight, for his own confidence and self image, and I'm glad for that. He's wanted an exercise bike for years, and now he's finally got one. I'm happy for him, because I want him to be confident in himself, and happy with himself. Confidence goes a hell of a long way in attractiveness. 

We discussed getting back on the same page concerning polyamory and rediscussed our boundaries. He's expressed wishes that in the future, we stick to only sexual partners, no romantic partners. He says he's okay and has no problems with Boyfriend and I, but that our relationship made him realize he wants it to be ""just us"" when we get much older. I said that this was something I could do, and while I could not guarantee that Boyfriend and I would break up someday (though it may be likely, as we have different wants for the future), I would not intentionally pursue any new romantic interests. 

So, we've been having good discussions and getting back into adjusting to our old life, before he left (3 months is nothing after all, right?), and yet here I am with a problem. 

I don't feel romantically inclined toward him lately. It terrifies me. I like him, and enjoy his company, and I have no desire to LEAVE him, but I have little desire to be here. I want to be in love with him again, because the consequences of me not loving him are so disastrous to both our lives, it's just not worth it. It's not like I want to leave him FOR my boyfriend; that's definitely not how I feel. But it wouldn't look like that at all, because I DO love Boyfriend, and would still be with him if, hypothetically, I did leave Fiance. But I don't want to do that. I don't want that at all. I want to continue my life with Fiance and I want to feel romantic feelings towards him again. I feel so so lost. I just feel sad at the loss of those feelings. I know it's normal to go through periods in a long term relationship where you don't feel absolutely in love all the time and fuzzy warm feelings all the time... but this just feels like disinterest. It feels worse and it feels scary and I don't know what to do. 

For the past few weeks since his return what I've been doing is just... giving it time. Maybe once we settle into our semester routine, and graduate, and get legit jobs, and all that jazz... I'll come back around. But right now, I'm terrified. I WANT to be in love with my Fiance. I want to FEEL in love with my Fiance. I would hate to lose everything I've built in life and hurt him so very much and have the life he's built with me come crashing down, just because I don't happen to feel a certain little way anymore. I'm hoping that it's just a phase. I kind of just needed to vent. I'm scared. I haven't told him any of this, because what's the point? Why would he be happy or content to continue being with someone who he loves, who says they're not sure if they still love him back? I don't want to do that. I want him to be happy. and I want to be happy with him. And we don't have the time or money right now to go searching for a poly-friendly relationship counselor and I just... needed to get this out. I need someone to tell me it will be okay and that I do or can still love him. We do romantic things together and such, but I just feel like I'm trying so hard and that in the end I'm just faking it. Or maybe I'm just scared that's what I'm doing. I don't know. I wonder if I'm just coming to the realization that I can be happy without him - that I have achieved independence - and choose to be with him, but I worry that he hasn't, that he is co-dependent. The way he talks about the future makes me feel like I'm his only source of this romantic happiness he can get and that makes me feel a little trapped. 

Now I'm just rambling. Thank you so much for reading.

**Update**: Well, J and I broke up last night. It was amicable and void of drama, which was good. We're gonna keep living together and the like, since not much will change, but I took off my ring. Sigh.

k330i,3,2011-09-02,personal freedom vs. cool career opportunity?,dslkjlsdfidk,BrownU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/k330i/personal_freedom_vs_cool_career_opportunity/,"sup brown.  i come to you with a dilemma.

basically, i happened into (via nepotism) this sweet internship this past summer in my field.  they want me back next summer and are really into the idea of ""growing"" me and hiring me after graduation.  the work is super interesting, i love the work environment, and it's awesome to have this life path set out for me so early.

the catch is that a long-term job in this specific area would require that i maintain certain lifestyle habits consistent with...  you know...  what the government thinks is ok.  in order to even start the process of getting cleared to do this work, i'd need to be clean of any illegal substance for 12 months (excluding underage alcohol).  so i thought about it a lot, quit everything mid-summer, and told my employers that i was planning to go for the clearance thing next summer.

but now that i'm back at brown and feeling all ~free and independent~ and shit, i'm already starting to wonder if that's the best choice for me.  i know that sounds kinda pathetic, like i can't live without drugs or something, but it's not like that.  it's just that i'm in ~college~ and ~exploring~ and, you know, this is my chance to do that...  i'd sort of feel cheated out of a couple years of personal freedom if i limited myself.

the company would most likely still rehire me next summer if i didn't abstain from substances this year, but i would feel kind of inconsiderate not making that small sacrifice for them, like i would be making myself an unworthy investment or whatever.  and then i'd face the same decision senior year and who knows what they'd think of my judgment by then and blah blah blah.  in an ideal world i'd just keep fuckin' around for the next two years, quit substances after college, and they'd find it worthwhile to keep me on for another year doing unclassified stuff and then hire me.  but of course i have no way of knowing if it'd pan out that way.

what would you do?

Several of my friends are fellow ents and landed similar internships, and have been smoking on the daily since they passed the pre-employment screening. I haven't lit up since March, and I really miss it.

I've been searching the website of the company I work for, and everything I was sent prior to employment, and I can't find anything about random drug tests, just the pre-employment screening. If I was going to be subject to random drug testing, would they have to notify me outright, or since I took the first one can they test me again whenever they feel like it? Am I just being paranoid, or would should I just wait out the rest of the year until the internship is over?

Love you guys."

k4co3,4,2011-09-04,I feel like a failure compared to my friends,posting_at_5am,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/k4co3/i_feel_like_a_failure_compared_to_my_friends/,"I don't really like myself much. There are a lot of reasons why, but I think if I can figure this one out, I can wake up the next day and think ""ok, maybe I'm not so bad"".

For a while now, it feels like I've been living under my friends' collective shadow. I think it started my sophomore or junior year of high school (for reference, I'm 22, graduated from college in June) when people started telling me that all I did was copy my friends or tag along with what they did/said, and that I should try to be myself. We hung out a lot, and it seemed like whenever there was some sort of conversation about us I was always discussed in the context of ""that guy that mainly tags along"". Admittedly, I did a lot of that, but I've always been quiet and withdrawn, while my friends were generally a lot more outspoken - I guess that's what that dynamic looked like from the outside.

Anyway, that happened all throughout high school, there was a bit of drama tangentially related to it but it's not important. It's only when we all go off to college that things start getting worse. I was really worried about college. I thought that I wasn't going to make any friends, that I had no idea how to talk to people, and to make matters even worse, that my old friends from high school would, after going off to college and forming new circles of friends like they obviously could, become more and more distant from me.

This mindset dictates my first two years of college. As it turns out, I was totally right, I was absolutely terrible at making new friends, and when my old friends decided to start playing World of Warcraft, I jumped right in and started playing 8-12 hours a day, for the next 2 years, to escape the fact that I couldn't make friends and saw everyone else around me doing it rather effortlessly. Predictably, my GPA plummeted, and my social life remained completely nonexistent. At one point I had an hours-long discussion with my RA about why I spent all my time killing internet dragons instead of actually going outside and doing things.

After my sophomore year of college, I quit WoW. I'm not too sure why I quit then; I think it was a combination of feeling sick of the game, and my friends (who had already quit by this point) goading me on to quit. My life got better after this, but the damage was done: I still had no friends, and my GPA was pretty terrible. I switched majors, and found that I really liked what I had switched into (it was pretty random to be honest...I just wanted to be able to get out with a degree).

I ended up doing alright academically, but that's really where, in comparison to my friends, I feel most strongly like a failure. Basically, my friends are all roughly at the same point in their lives as me, and they're a LOT better off. Two of them are going to really good law schools, another a really good med school. I have another friend who's going to a good engineering grad school, and one more who's got a good job in New York. Me? I have nothing. I'm planning to apply to grad school this fall (there are a lot of issues surrounding me and grad school, but that is a completely different bag of worms) but I haven't really done anything since moving back home after graduation. I know I should be looking for work, or an internship, or *something*, but...I just haven't.

I guess it's not really enough to talk about ""results"" or whatever you want to call them. For me, the worst part about all of this is a feeling of futility. Whenever I feel like trying to work on something, there's a part of me that questions whether or not there's a point. My friends are already doing these great things with their lives, whatever I could do couldn't possibly compare. Even if I manage to do whatever it is I'm trying to do, I'm just going to stand in their shadow."

k3ypd,2,2011-09-03,Atheism Testimonies,Seanradio,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/k3ypd/atheism_testimonies/,"So we all know in the Christian church people are encouraged to share with people how the came to be ""saved"" and the wonders god has done in their life since then and so on and so forth. 

I have a few self proclaimed atheist friends whom Ive known for years that have always been atheist or at least agnostic. Nobody ever seems to talk about their light bulb moment when they decided to follow their doubt and become critical thinkers. I am interested to hear how those of you in the r/atheism community came to your individual realizations. Maybe there is someone lurking around who is on the border of belief and they find themselves in a similar situation as we all once were. 

Ill start.

Like most white middle class families in America, I grew up in a semi-christian household. Dad was Catholic (non-practicing) mom was protestant (not really practicing either). My grandmother would take us to the church near her house (Dad excluded) for years until they moved down to Florida. After they moved, we all stopped going. This never really hindered my parents belief system as we said grace before dinner and would still go to church when the grandparents were in town. 

Fast forward to teenage years I started getting into punk music, skateboarding (all the typical things the ""cool"" kids used to do right?) and getting into good ol' American trouble. It was at this point in my life where I wasn't too sure whether or not I believed in a god, but in my mind I had no evidence to disprove it. 

My senior year in high-school a friend of mine was shot walking home from his job at dominos for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. When a tragedy like this occurs, I believe that one can become emotionally unstable and start to either look for answers of the unknown, or start questioning a solid belief. I chose the former after being taken on one of those youth retreats where they play the sad music and tell you how everything is better with Jesus.

After this I was gung-ho, let me tell you. I started going to two services a week, bible club at school, early morning prayer sessions mid week, I was a beast at being a Christian.
My grades werent the best in high school, my SAT scores were shitty and our family was pretty broke. When the time came for me to apply to colleges I thought I was out of luck. I really wanted to go to a Christian university and become a youth pastor. (did i mention I was really good at being a Christian?) 
I found a school finally that wasnt necessarily a Christian school, but did have some affiliation with the Methodist church. It was a liberal arts college, requirements werent to steep and...they offered a scholarship to lead the college worship team. I have always played music, and within those last months of my senior year in high school I knew just about every worship song you could imagine. To make a long story short, I got in, and got the scholarship.
I chose a double major in Religion/Philosophy (i wanted to be able to battle all the non believers in their own game). There were many viewpoints presented to me that first year of school. Viewpoints I had never considered, never thought about and never new existed. As this provided good food for thought i still decided that I needed to pursue what I was already going for, I started to have my doubts again, but none of them were more powerful than the thought of losing that scholarship and not being able to finish my college education.
Part of the religion program was to get an internship or work for a church at some point. I was still pretty gung ho so I decided to go for it the summer after my freshman year. I got a gig at a local baptist church playing standup bass and being an assistant to the youth pastor.
Every couple of summers the youth group there would raise money to go on a mission trip somewhere around the world, and whatever money they couldnt raise, the church would cover the rest. Since I was an employee of the church they paid my full way to go on a trip to Quito, Ecuador. I was pretty excited to say the least. I had never been out of the country, rarely ever got to fly, and now was my chance to bring the word of jeeeeeeeeesus, to a people who I thought needed to hear it.

The Southern Baptist Convention owned a piece of property in Quito in which they built a facility to house missionaries, employ the locals to cook and clean for them, hot running water, warm food, warm beds and electricity for the whole compound. I thought at this point that all of Quito had facilities like this and was starting to wonder why we were here.
Every day we would travel up the mountain to small, poor villages to talk to people about jesus. We had a skit that explained why Jesus came to earth, what he had done for the world and how easy it was to accept him into your life. We would give them candy,cereal and soda when they answered bible trivia correctly and when they came to accept Jesus.
These small villages were in really terrible condition, and here we were, a bunch of young, strong, college/high school students that werent doing anything but talking about how all this will get better once you accept Jesus.
Needless to say, this experienced sparked the need to further dig into these other viewpoints, to study the history of the religion i chose to follow without question and eventually start to figure out the politics of the american church system.
I have been an atheist now for about 8 years but have only been really open about it for half of that time. 
I have managed to lose some friends, gain some friends, have huge blowout arguments and have really connected with some folks who shared my same dilemma out of the same church. 
I have proven to be good without god as some former classmates had no idea that I was no longer a believer but assumed I was based on my actions.

I want to hear some of your stories on how you came to your realizations as I am sure some of you have some great stories.

k5sah,1,2011-09-05,Starting a Morning Workout Regimen,darthluke,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/k5sah/starting_a_morning_workout_regimen/,"Hello /r/fitness. 


I've always felt weak, and this shows even when I try to wake up in the morning. Sometimes, I try to get out of bed and I'm so tired that while pushing myself off, my arm trembles a little. I can't bench my own weight (about 120 pounds, 5'7), and sometimes when I'm walking, I feel like I'm ""walking weakly"" (whatever that means). I will also admit that my diet is pretty horrible (vegetarian).


Now, I do a hell of a lot of stuff during the day, and am extremely, extremely busy. I don't want to make working out my life, but I do need to do something about this. I know I am physically weak, and all the stuff that I am so passionate about, it seems my body can't handle. Sure, I can go the entire day without eating and get everything done, but it is a bit difficult. 


I have decided to start working out in the morning. I go to college, and we have free access to the gyms there. I'm planning on leaving my house and driving over, reaching there at about 6:30 AM when the gym opens. I look slim as all hell (can even see my abs), but I just don't have the strength, stamina, and endurance. (The trembling.) 

My concerns at this point:

* Being tired the rest of the day after strength and cardio training in the morning. I have a tough academic schedule, extracurriculars, and other meetings. I also drive a hell of a lot.

* Hygiene: Planning on bringing a duffel bag with my day's normal clothes and shower materials, and showering after my workout in the morning. Throwing the old clothes in the duffel bag, place duffel bag back in car, and changing out new non-workout clothes every night.

* What kinds of exercises to do exactly. I can look this up, but generally, I am pretty fucking weak, so it'll look ridiculous if I'm trying to bench like 100 pounds. I also want to improve cardiovascular fitness so I'll hop on an elliptical or bike for that as well.

* Self-conscious. I'm doing a shitload of stuff, when people around me can't even wake up for classes and doze off in class. It just feels like I'm doing too much for my age (this is bullshit, I know. It's those who realize their potential earlier that have the greatest chances to be successful and happy earlier, and contribute to humanity). I need to put these feelings behind me as I know they will surface in the gym when I look ridiculous curling 15 pound dumbbells. 




I've worked at large companies before as an intern, and I know how people go to the gym during their (1-hour!) lunch break, or early morning, or after work. I don't want to do it after work because I have too much stuff to do, and I have no interest in going to an overly crowded gym where some of the people are just there for fun or even picking up women. I always liked the solitude of an early morning gym (used to go to one at 5 AM in high school, don't remember feeling that great from it though.)



Has anyone ever been in this situation? Whether or not you have, can you please offer advice as I am looking to become fit. I don't want to be a bodybuilder, but I want to look fit/muscular, and above all else, have strength and stamina so I don't feel tense, weak, and shivery all the time. 



I am in need of a body that can live up to the brutal amount of work, fueled by genuine passions, that I must complete. Thank you in advance."
k5ij0,2,2011-09-05,Some musings,darksim905,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/k5ij0/some_musings/,"I've made similar posts to this in the past. I just need to vent and get some thoughts out along with things I am struggling with. I have no idea how long or short this will be; depends on if my mood changes by the time I am done with it. 

I will be 25 soon. I am collecting unemployment. I currently work at an unpaid internship. I should ideally be getting a job making $16/hr or more, full time to make more than unemployment. I feel like there is something wrong with me, or that I am an idiot because I am on unemployment.

I only go to the internship two/three days out of the week because I do not have much money for gas. I feel like I do not ask as many questions as I should, or learn about the environment. I feel like I am letting down the guy I work with. He is insanely relaxed, to the point where I wonder if there is something wrong with him. (I jest, dude!) It makes me feel better to know there are as relaxed people in the world that don't make a big deal out of what everyone else does. It is a small environment. There are a handful of servers. I'm not sure how to get back into the learning-mode streak I had a few months ago.

Up until I lost my last job, I was in a constant learning mode, learning bits and pieces of technology here and there to get certifications so I can have an easier time getting a job. I ran into problems when I lost the job and was told to collect unemployment. My boss replaced me without telling me, essentially, and didn't even give me a second chance or opportunity to rectify the situation. Granted, it isn't like I worked for a large corporation or anything. I wouldn't mind that: A job with a steady paycheck where I get just enough respect for what I do. 

Respect. Do I not get or deserve any, merely because I'm a type B? Yes, I conform to that personality type, and it shows in a lot of what I do. I don't necessarily let it rule my life, but I know my place, what I'm capable of, and what I want. See, you Type A people out there go by silly motto, quotes, and things. One I recall seeing on the blog of someone who spoke at a resume work shop had that cliche phrase: 

&gt; Things may come to those who wait, but only what's left behind by those that hustle.

This quote is allegedly attributed to Abraham Lincoln. I won't get into my skepticism about the quote probably not being from Abraham Lincoln. I'm in the middle-ground, though. I'm not someone who waits. I'm someone who will take part of whatever it is the person who is hustling is after, so even the person who waits has nothing.

Can I *hustle*? Can I do what needs to get done? Sure. But I have no reason or care to. Bust my ass and sweat for minimum wage? For a job that isn't in line with what I've went to school for, or want to do? For just 'any' job, as my father, or other people say to do in this economy? No, there's no point. 

I can hear the yelling now. My dad used to yell at me and think that I **don't get it.** As if I don't understand the larger complexities of life and being an adult. That is if, because I've been let go from one job, or struggle to do things that someone else, who is a Type A or just gets shit done without hesitation, has an easy time doing.

Call me a sensitive wimp, a fucking pussy, or whatever. I get done what I need to, *when* I need to. Is that necessarily so bad? Do I have to do something, or get into a scheme that nets me money while I sleep? What do I have to do to **get it**, Reddit? Do I have to care a little bit more? If so, that's fucking impossible. I care for few things: My girlfriend &amp; her dog, My Internet Connection, My few loyal friends, and my own well-being. 

Everything else is small potatoes. I suppose you could sum up how I handle things by this maxim:

&gt; Matters of great concern should be treated lightly. Matters of small concern should be
&gt; treated seriously.

Everything that's a big deal to my dad, is small to me. Because he doesn't know the real me. He's never seen the real me. He doesn't comprehend what goes through my mind, the thoughts I spill out here on Reddit. The things I talk to my girlfriend about, that her and her dog seem to understand better than most people.

Is this my problem, though? Should I be making a massive stink about things of great concern? Should I be saying ''Oh shit. My electricity got cut off. I have to do something about that now!'' Guess what? Today is labor day. I can't do anything about that till tomorrow. The stress of having such a mentality is useless, wasteful, and a mark of insanity to me. 

Maybe it's because I don't really give a shit, in any case. What? My mom allegedly has cancer, or some kind of disease? I don't care. End result: She didn't have anything, a doctor messed up her blood work, and nothing happened. A massive fucking scare, for nothing. 

What? I get yelled at because my dad says I am selfish, worthless, and stupid? I have problems or am lazy because I didn't wrap a gift for (insert person here), and used a gift bag? Newsflash: I'm not the best gift wrapper, and bags are there for convenience and ease of use.

Every time I say all this someone they just look at me and shrug. Maybe they finally realize why I look so glum, indifferent, and stoic all the time. All these stresses on me. Stresses I hide. I say that things don't bother me, and eventually they get to me, unfortunately. About once every few months I break down and cry, in my room, by myself. It is very hard to get motivated or do anything during this moment in time. I only feel better or 'okay' when I wake up the next day. 

Oh well.

And I've seen people that are worse. I have a friend of mine who struggles, and complains every second of the day about *something*. It's almost impossible to deal with. It's that he's always alone, or has no friends, or has no freedom, or has no job, or has a shitty job, or blargh life sucks, or this TV isn't good, or oh my god this music rules, yours sucks. 

Those types of people drag me down, and most people in life down. At least I only do that once every few months. ;)

Ugh. So much crap to do tomorrow. I have to apply for jobs more. Continue with my unemployment claim. See if someone nearby still needs help with their computer. Pick my girlfriend's brain about what may be wrong with her car, if anything. Get the utilities transferred to my name: this is the only thing I worry about. I'm glad my parents have moved out otherwise I wouldn't hear the end of it. They told me to do it a week ago before they left. If I say anything or they find out, I'll still manage to get yelled at over the phone, guaranteed. 

It's always something. Fuck it."

&gt;**Steps for mods to follow before modding someone:**

&gt;**1. Cross-reference with the blacklist:**  The blacklist is on the ModMail, do ctrl+f for it and you'll see the blacklist there. If the name is on there, do not mod them should they request. If you see them on the mod list, remove them.

&gt;**2. Check when their account was made:** If it was made today or two days ago, it is most likely a troll (Do check other factors before deciding on that however.)

&gt;**3. Check their post history:** If their post history reeks of them being a troll, don't mod them. An incident here or there is fine, almost everyone has done that before, but having a constant history of it is a red flag.

&gt;PLANS FOR IF A MODERATOR GOES POSTAL:

&gt;**1. Do not panic** - 93% of people who are murdered die while panicking. Would you rather die calmly or while panicking? If they're going to shoot you, you're dead either way.

&gt;**2. Play dead** - This works not only with bears, but also moderators-gone-homicidal. If the bullets start flying, fall down to look like they shot you.

&gt;**3. Put your arms up to intimidate them** - It's a fact that people are scared of things bigger than them. If you look like you're a 7-foot tall monster, you may scare them long enough to cause them to drive the weapon, flee in terror or have a heart attack.

&gt;**4. Interns are your friends (But only during this crisis)** - And by that, I mean they're the redshirts of the real world. Have Joe cover the door while you make your escape, or have Felicia go get you some coffee if Jacob is out in the lobby shooting everyone. He may think the room you're currently in is empty due to having killed someone, and may continue on. A common mistake that people make is befriending these people, either before, during or after a situation like this happens. Attachment to them will make it harder for you to do the necessary thing and sacrifice them for the good of your own life, and will most likely result in both of you dying.

&gt;**5. If all else fails, panic** - Yes, playing dead didn't work, neither did trying to look bigger to scare him, and he called the bluff because he knew you hated Mark. The only option now is to panic, or hope SWAT (Or your country's equivalent) comes in and saves the day. So unless you're living in a movie where you're the main character and this is the climax of the film, you're dead.

k51x6,4,2011-09-05,For RIT Freshmen looking for jobs,The_Admin,rit,https://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/k51x6/for_rit_freshmen_looking_for_jobs/,"I know we have a ton of freshmen who are out their who are, lets be honest, being pushed by there parents to find a job on campus and stop sucking them dry ( I kid ). I thought i would repeat which i posted in the comments of another thread what i thought were good ways to get yourself employed at RIT. 

For all the new freshmen looking for the job, they're a few sources for jobs.

**On Campus -**

*http://www.rit.edu/emcs/seo/jobs/oncampus/
 
*ASK YOUR FRIENDS. The best way at RIT to get a job is word of mouth. I know tons of employers that dont do regular interview processes. Maybe they are not even hiring atm, but you are very skilled, they might even be willing to get you in to talk to you. 

*ASK YOUR INSTRUCTORS. Some instructors have pet projects that need students or know people that do. This is also a great way to get co-ops. This can also lead to lab positions, or keeping you in mind for other projects or hard to get classes when showing you go above and beyond. Hint - dont do this to professors that hate you.

*Eat your pride, and join food services they are ALWAYS hiring. If they dont hire you week one, dont despair. I can tell you for sure a lot of kids will quit food services in there first week there because they are too good for it, or another job comes through. May i suggest Catering, they are a lot more selective then they use to be, however you sign up for shifts so you control your hours, and there is lots of room for job growth. Dont forget, you are never too good to flip burgers. BONUS - you get lots of free food, not as much as a few years ago, but it's still a sweat deal.

*Do well in your classes, Most lab/TA jobs at RIT have gpa/class requirements to get them and they are very competitive to get. Plus again these jobs can lead to other jobs. 

**Off Campus-**

*Craigslist again for Rochester jobs.

*http://www.rit.edu/emcs/seo/jobs/offcampus/ for off campus jobs, but that's less used.

*This is rochester, tons of room to do contract work around henrietta and rochester depending on your major. I can promise you doing a year of contract work, starting your own business, or doing volunteer work can look just as good as a year of internships, and it is a great talking point in interviews. 


Good luck out there, and have fun, all your coworkers are RIT students in the same situation you are and you should show respect and help out those around you.

k501k,0,2011-09-05,Luck and networking go a long way,[deleted],lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/k501k/luck_and_networking_go_a_long_way/,"I graduated in May with a degree in engineering. My plan was of last year was to get a MS (in engineering, where a MS is actually a very useful degree), but unlike a PhD, funding for a MS is pretty hard to come by, especially in today's economy. Unfortunately, that plan was scrapped only a few months before I was set to graduate. And as a BS in engineering is the professional degree, I should be paid for my work, so I decided to get a real job rather than pay for grad school on my own.

To make a long story short, I applied to any engineering job I could find that I was qualified for and was interested in. Applying to 40 to 50 jobs netted one phone interview that went nowhere despite the fact that I adjusted my resume for each job and was otherwise qualified and interested. This seems to be typical.

Earlier this year I had worked out an internship at a national lab for the summer only. This was supposed to be a bridge between my BS and MS, but I now saw it as an opportunity. I explained my situation to my boss there. He has a PhD in engineering, and he couldn't believe that I wasn't preparing for grad school. He didn't want to believe it, in fact. He first tried to hire me temporarily so I could apply to other schools later, but that went nowhere due to insanity in DC.

He then tried to use some of his connections to get me into a MS program where I got my BS. This, at first, appeared to go nowhere. So he then tried to use some of his professional connections to get me an interview. And this was immediately successful. I interviewed at a company and was offered an excellent salary and great benefits. Their work was fascinating, too.

But around the time that offer came in, I also got an offer for full funding of my MS studies. This was a hard decision, but I decided a MS was better for me right now.

Admittedly, I do have some skills and knowledge that few folks have. That undoubtedly helped me here. But if you're stuck like I was, talk to people and just keep trying. Try to highlight what differentiates you from others. With some luck you might actually be able to turn someone down instead of them turning you down. And don't feel bad if you're not successful (yet) as this is a crappy economy and luck is a huge factor.

TL;DR: Through networking and a lot of luck I got a good job offer and an offer for a fully funded MS in engineering. I'm working on the MS now."
k5wy4,0,2011-09-05,"I'm not sure if you guys will like this, but what was your ""catch"" in admissions? Do I stand a chance?",[deleted],stanford,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/k5wy4/im_not_sure_if_you_guys_will_like_this_but_what/,"What was the thing that you really think got you into Stanford? Something you did? Not that I want to replicate it, but I just want to get an idea of what the admissions team likes so I can figure out if I am in line. I wouldn't fake interests just to get into a school. 

I'm currently a Junior in HS and here is everything notable:

* 4.0 GPA Sophomore year and will likely continue through Junior and Senior years. Wasn't motivated Freshman year and got a 3.1.
* Run several self created websites that earn around $200 a month. By the time I would be applying I hope to have 5-10 sites total, and who knows where that would put my earnings at.
* Learning programming in Java. REALLY liking it and hoping to get into a few open source projects in the future. If I can make a nice piece of freeware that gets some decent ratings before I apply, I think that would really increase my chances.
* Internship at a web design company over the summer and now, might turn into actual job at some point.
* If I could get good enough at programming, I could get a more prominent programming internship over next summer, as my aunt has very good connections in D.C.
* School newspaper Editor
* Key Club
* 100+ hours volunteering (required by school though haha)
* Varsity soccer, track, and cross country
* From seeing my results on practice SAT tests, with a bit more work I could score really high, possibly even 2100 or 2200!
* Always in AP classes, but I didn't know the tests helped on anything other than credits, so I'll only be taking my first this year.

Ultimately though, I just really want to go to Stanford. I'll probably major in Computer Science and what better place to be than Stanford and Silicon Valley? If I could get into Stanford, I'd be well on my way to an awesome career programming or perhaps my own startup! That would be amazing and I think Stanford could set me on that path better than any college. Of course, there are other colleges I'd be happy at, but Stanford is the best case scenario.

k7v2i,6,2011-09-07,I had an epiphany yesterday...,hereweareonceagain,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/k7v2i/i_had_an_epiphany_yesterday/,"I'm 26 years old and am graduating Grad school in a couple months and have no idea where I'll end up applying, working or living. For me, its been years and years of post-secondary school, being broke, renting shitty apartments, having shitty roomates, etc. I'm tired and I want to start my life. I know what I want - a decent job, settle down into home, buy a car and get a dog. I'm a simple girl.

My bf and I have been together for a little under 2 years. We have been doing our relationship long-distance for a couple months now because I'm on an internship and its all really stressful. He is a year younger than me and not ready for anything. He's done school and working but doesn't know where he wants to work or live long-term and isn't ready to move in together or take the next step and has made it pretty clear that he doesn't want me to make any decisions based on him.

I spent the last couple of months worrying and trying to plan so things will work out. Trying to nudge him in my direction, fishing for reassurance of our future, hinting about what kind of place we could afford or what engagement rings I like.... and it's not his fault that it scares him but I don't want to do this. I finally asked myself last night....why the hell am I driving myself crazy?

I can graduate and get a job. I can move to a new town and pay back my student loans. I can get a car and eventually buy a house and adopt a dog. I can make my own dreams come true and be happy. I would LOVE to share my life with him - I LOVE HIM - but I don't want to have to force him to do it or hold my breath until he wants to truley make a commitment.

Its a shame that I've already braced myself for a possible relationship expiration date but it feels good to realize I don't have to be a needy and dependant person anymore.

TL;DR Realized I don't need someone else to make me happy if that what it takes to do what's right for me.

EDIT: He read the post and is happy about it. A lot less pressure on him. I still figure I'm going to have to walk away from the relationship when I move in a couple months based on how the long-distance thing has gone these last few months. oh well, if it was meant to be, it was meant to be."
k7m74,0,2011-09-07,WWRD? (What would reddit do) The employment blues.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/k7m74/wwrd_what_would_reddit_do_the_employment_blues/,"I’m currently a pleb working at almost the bottom rung on the ladder at a university library.  So, it’s a dead-end job.  The organization doesn’t appear to want to train anyone (inefficient use of money? wasted time?), so basically there’s no promotion from within.  Whatever level you are hired on is where you’ll stay.  Out of 100 employees, about 5-7 are getting to learn new skills and even get financial support to travel to conferences. The rest of us stagnate and worse yet, watch what skills we do have atrophy as the years go by.  If you don’t want to succumb, you have to finance things out of your own pocket and on your own time.

I’m now 47 years old and have been here for 5 years.  I still earn $10.40 per hour, but at least I have health insurance.  For the last 4 years I have tried to grow my skills on my own.  Taking programming and database classes (and acing them).  I also pitched ideas that I thought would be easy to implement while at the same time allowing me to learn new things and create something new for the library. (automating record creation for electronic thesis and dissertations from user submitted metadata using either perl scripts or XSLT crosswalks or creating QR codes that allow a patron to look up journal title changes with their phones while they are browsing the stacks…(simple query of the 780/785 field in a MARC record))  I didn’t think these ideas were stupid or a waste of time.  I really believed in them.  I also thought they’d be well within my skill set as a programming neophyte.  But so far all I hear is crickets chirping in response ….for 3 years now. I’ve only mentioned 2 of my ideas in this post, but I’ve had more.  I can understand why many of them are ignored, but all of them?  This confuses me.  I keep taking a programming class here and there in order to try to keep a semblance of skills.  But really, as a beginner, I don’t’ see how I can volunteer for open source projects that are well beyond my capabilities right now.  

Recently a job came open in our systems dept. that used to be held by a guy who started at the library as a student worker.  I really thought I’d have a chance so I applied.  Yeah, I’d need to be trained a bit, but the only thing on the skills list that I didn’t know yet was .NET and ASP (I know JSP).  Surely after working here for 5 years, and really trying earnestly to grow, showing curiosity, and energy I thought they’d give me a shot.  Instead, they hired someone totally new, but he’s got 6 years of work experience in programming and web development though.  How in the world can someone like me compete when folks like that are playing in the shallow end of the pool?

So, WWRD?  I’ve tried showing that I really want to play the game with them by enrolling in grad school in library science (the curriculum is really weak and I felt self conscious taking it.  I did focus on the few programming/database classes they had even though it was really a repeat of what I already know). I had hoped that as a grad student I would get to pursue some of my project ideas …sort of like a research/coop sort of thing.  Perhaps I could have done a poster session at a conference or written them up as a technical paper.  That wasn’t even remotely what happened.  I was still ignored.  My job was still 100% to grind away editing records line by line; 80% of which really should be done in batches with scripts.  None of the administration or my supervisors created any possibility of my growing my skills for the brief period I was in grad school. So my thought was what’s the point of book learning if you can’t really *do* anything.  How does this make me competitive for a job?  Anyway,  now I have student loan debt and nothing to show for my effort.

Other relevant details:  I live in a small college town in MS where the cost of living is fairly high despite being in MS. I have no family that can help me with things like insurance or any big expenses.  Most entry level work around here seems to be college work-study based, meaning part-time, minimum wage and no insurance *and* limited to students.  Other part time jobs in the community are dead-end; you don’t learn anything that will help you get a future job that could grow into a middle class wage.  I currently have a living wage, but no substantial savings.  I just had to tap into what I did have to pay for 1400 bucks worth of dental care.

I’m considering getting a certification in medical coding instead.  At least that will only cost about 2 grand (yay…more debt!) to get the training needed to sit for the initial certification exam.  But I’ve started to read employment forums and I’m seeing a lot of people who have ponied up the money and gotten the CCA and some the CCS, but they can’t get a job because they haven’t had a job in coding before.  So how in the world are you supposed to get your initial skill set if you can’t live on part-time, minimum wage work (or free internship)?  I can’t think of anything else to do so I’m picking the collective brain of reddit.  Any ideas?

k7e67,16,2011-09-07,"Male cat goes missing and presumed gone forever. A year later, he's sighted.",Arreana,cats,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/k7e67/male_cat_goes_missing_and_presumed_gone_forever_a/,"Is he feral forever?

I’m new to r/cats, so please feel free to redirect me if you know of another thread that might help! But to start I guess I need to give some history to better frame the question. Please bear with me!

I adopted a kitten back in 2008, a male tabby named “Sausage”. For the first six months of his life he lived with my husband, myself, and our spayed female tuxedo in our apartment. In this time, he grew big and fast and very, very manly. We loved him and his big, slobbery ways, and though we got him neutered a bit late (his face had already chunked out) we never had any problems with spraying or roaming.

Fast forward to some family/financial trouble mid-2008, and my husband and I move back in with my widower father-in-law, five acres in the country with room to romp and play and a cat-door to boot. We introduce both cats to the outside slowly, and for the first month or so both are gloriously happy. Sausage, big brute that he is, quickly becomes a star mouser.

Then my husband and I go on vacation for a week. When we return, we find that Sausage has gone missing during that time. Upset, we search the entire property night after night. We do everything to look for him, but hear nothing. Then the following week he just… shows up. He’s skin and bones and yowling. He spends the next three days stuck to me like glue (even following me into the shower). He recovers fine, and, aside from a few cat fights I have to break up between him and the local ferals, there are no problems. He gets fatter. He gets lazier.

Then summer 2010 rolls around and my husband lands an internship out of town. While he’s gone for four weeks I stay with my mom and help her care for my much younger siblings. I drop by to visit the cats frequently, and I make sure they’re being fed. I sit with them for hours to make sure they’ve had their fill of pets.
But only a week into our month-long absence Sausage goes missing again. We go through all the same efforts to find him, but this time we’re not so lucky. No sign of him. He doesn’t reappear. After three weeks without a sighting we give him up for lost.

Then this summer we’re outside barbequing, and who should come slinking out from under the house but a thinner, more toned Sausage. I cried out to him in my surprise. He must have been only thirty feet away, but the minute he saw me he bolted for the trees. I’ve seen him on two other occasions, once more emerging from beneath the house, another stocking through the trees. Both times he’s bolted. I’ve also heard him in the garage yowling (he has a very distinct yowl). I put food out there, but he’s always off like a bullet before I’ve even opened the door.

So my question for you all: have any of you ever had a cat go feral like this? I don’t know whether I should even entertain a hope of coaxing him back. We’re delighted that our worst fears – coyote, car, etc. – turned out to be false, but we miss him horribly, and I find myself desperately hoping he’ll just reappear one day, yowling for food.

(Warning: Text Wall)",Kindred_Soul,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/k772g/i_went_crazy_but_i_came_back_better_than_ever_id/,"I've been through a hard time this past year and I feel like reddit has helped me so much. At the start of this summer I was at the end of my rope, and then I read reddit. I went to r/GetMotivated and I was pumped to deal with anything, I went to r/ihaveissues and r/relationshipadvice and saw ways to overcome problems I had been struggling with for years. I went to r/loseit and r/fitness and I've finally gotten control of my weight. I've even been to r/trees and learned to be the best Good Guy Greg I can be. Thank you all so much! I love you guys. Here is my story:

My mind races with dreams of ways to save this world. Some are childish, some are bold, they all require more experience than I have. A lot of people see me as lucky, someone who was given everything I asked for and was blessed with some greater talent. I’m not. I was never as smart as my friends, I made sure of that. I surrounded myself with people who were much better at things than myself. I only got anywhere because I tried to keep up people who I knew were better than me. After a while, I was being pulled in so many directions of what I wanted to do that I wanted nothing more than to escape to the woods for the rest of my days, to live as a hermit. But my friends convinced me to go to school, for something. I didn’t have to know what, but I had to go for something. I’m glad I listened. I got there, and I had no fucking clue what to do. I picked the first thing that came to mind, Physics, because I liked the class in high school. The college I went to is no fucking public high school, I learned that the hard way. I scraped by while others maintained 4.0s with hard work. I felt like I was too stupid, too lazy to be a physicist. It hurt my pride. I was stupid to have any at all. So, I quit: at the advice of my girlfriend, I became a business major, so I could follow in her father’s footsteps, I guess. I didn’t give a shit about it, but I felt it was what I needed to do in order to accomplish my grand schemes. Then there was the stuff I abhorred in high school, that I was so against. I delved into everything I hated so much before: sex, drugs, weed, smoking cigarettes and alcohol. I’m glad I did. Yeah, it made me a hypocrite to go against my own morals at the time, but it gave me perspective.  It helped me be much more open, more accepting. I went overboard though and it hurt me. It hurt my grades, my relationships, my family and I can’t take that back. I hate what I put them through. It looked as though I would become some greedy, masochistic, asshole business owner that would never accomplish anything more than a failed business or two. I knew I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. So I did what I had to do: suicide of my old self. It wasn’t pretty. I sabotaged every relationship I had; every crush, every new friend, every person who ever saw me around campus.

For the record, I didn’t consciously go crazy; but after losing my girlfriend of 3.5 years, backstabbing my roommate at the advice of my ex, and getting so frustrated at my incompetent manager at my job, who fired one of my best friends who was so beside himself that he wanted to commit suicide because of all the shit that piled up in his life, I gave up. I quit caring what people thought. I spiraled. I didn’t sleep, every thought became reality no matter how absurd. I thought that every living being was a god in their own right and that they had the power to do whatever they wished, so long as whatever it was didn’t impede on anyone’s else’s own world. Crazy, right? I likened myself into some, weird, aeon child that was somehow special, able to see that the world was a beautiful place where rules of social order could be changed on a whim, like some game of tag where the leader picks the rules. Crazy, right? I thought that by training physically each night when the campus was quiet, serene, that I’d be able to become a great parkour athlete that could scale buildings and ignore the boundaries set up by rigid societies. Crazy, right? I thought I could employ a sort of variant of the ubermench sleep cycle that replaced sleep with meditation. THAT IS CRAZY.  The REM cycles are different in meditation than sleep, which I was not skilled in to begin with, and that’s what led me to go crazy. You can’t replace sleep with meditation, it’s not physically possible. That’s when the hallucinations started, that’s when shit got real and I found myself in two different mental institutions sleeping off this nightmare I put myself into. I got out; but I was far-gone until mid January until the drugs started to level me out. By that point, though, I was so fucking embarrassed about the entire situation that I just avoided as many people as I could. They called me “Crazy Kindred_Soul” and I hated it. My last semester, I reaped what I sowed; a miserable commute of 80+ miles a day of driving because the dean was scared to have me with another roommate so I had to live with my parents. I never stayed on campus for very long, and while I had a few friends who wanted to reach out and keep hanging out with me, I mostly stayed to myself. I didn’t party, I didn’t even talk to the people who saw me go crazy. Most of them thought I had burned out, someone who was so full of potential that was doomed to spend the rest of his life as some bum moving from mental institution to mental institution with some strange form of psychosis or bi-polar disorder. I was just sleep deprived, and it affected me for months afterwards. I limped to the finish-line of graduating; I just wanted to get by, without seeing anyone. Everyone saw me as someone who was insane, or someone who would only achieve anything if I was given the option to “opt out.” I walked at graduation, but it was a hollow victory. I wanted my senior year to be the best; it was the worst. I was short a credit to make matters worse. I wanted to just be done with it all, to get the hell out. The start of the summer was still miserable since I was so disappointed in myself that I didn’t graduate on time. Impossible standards given my situation, but I didn’t care. At some point, though, I realized I wasn’t so bad off, I had come through a lot, and managed to pull myself back together. I signed up for a leadership class at my community technical college, which I WISH that my school had.  I knew accounting like the back of my hand, but I didn’t know leadership. Meanwhile, I looked for other jobs, but I did a half-ass job of that because I didn’t think they’d take me without a degree. My parents urged me to apply anyway. I did. It was June. I applied at exactly one place that was an accounting job. I also got a call from Acxiom about an internship, but the interview was a textbook example of what could go wrong in an interview. I didn’t have an updated resume, my clothes were wrinkled, I hadn’t shaved, and my cell phone went off during the interview. Fucking fantastic! I didn’t get the job. I applied at exactly one place that was an accounting job. I didn’t ever hear anything back from it after I put in my application. That was June. I took up selling Cutco knives just to have some excuse for a job to make my parents happy. My relatives and family friends were happy to buy, but I didn’t have the confidence to think that anyone else would. So, I didn’t even try. I took my summer class at my hometown community college, and I loved it. It was bizarre as an exchange student to hear students and the professor talk about parties from my school since my community college doesn’t party or something. Flash forward to August. It’s the last day of class, and as I’m finishing my final term paper for the course, I get a call from the accounting job I applied for back in June. I was ecstatic. At this point, I had my awful interview out of the way, and since then, I went to a public job expo at my community college and got some advice on interviews. It must have come in handy, I got the job. Now, it’s September, and I feel more like myself, more human, more real than I’ve ever felt in my life. I’m done with self-pity, with my own petty problems. I’m working as an accountant at a nonprofit organization whose sole purpose is to provide underprivileged children with quality education and support. I’m mandated by the state to report child abuse when I see it.  love this job, and my co-workers are awesome. It’s weird being the seventh male in a state-wide company, but it doesn’t bother me. I’m where I need I be, and getting the experience I need to start my own nonprofit someday. But I know, for all that I’ve managed, I’m just getting started. And that’s exciting. A few years from now, I know I’ll have to go back to school and get my P.H.D. or some other Doctorate to gain any sort of real credibility for anything. But, a B.A. in Business and Economics is a good start, and I’m glad I stuck with it."
k9etq,1,2011-09-08,[For hire] Front-end Web Designer looking to expand portfolio!,pantsmcawesome,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/k9etq/for_hire_frontend_web_designer_looking_to_expand/,"Evening, r/freelance! To start off, I'm Zach Godin! 

A little about me? Well, long story short, I'm a Web Design student finishing up in the spring. Between working to pay off debts and studying, I haven't really had much time to get together as outstanding of a portfolio as I would like to have. That said, I do have one with a handful of front-end web projects, as well as some animation! 

Where is this mysterious portfolio, you ask? Right here: http://zachgod.in 

Why I'm looking for freelance jobs? I'm currently doing an unpaid internship with a local company (as is requirement for my graduating). While I do have enough to support myself for a little bit, there's a long story that I can sum up with saying that a) I need more experience so I can build a better portfolio, and thus get better work... and b) my mother and I are going to be moving from Ontario to Birmingham in England in April, so I figured the more money helps!

**What I Do!**
HTML/CSS (including HTML5/CSS3) / Fluid &amp; Responsive layouts / Flash Animation (I don't do, or believe in, Flash sites, but if you would like one, I'm more than willing to negotiate) / Basic graphic design / Email forms / Light Javascript/jQuery / Light PHP / Adhere to web standards and practices

**What I Don't Do!**
Back-end web development / Setting up servers / Trade sexual favours for divs 


Ideally, updating websites, static pages (though I can work with setting up dynamic pages; I'm not *that* useless!), banner ads, logos, inquiry forms and more of the awesome stuff that just makes your work look good!

I'm very, very, *veeeeeeeeeeeery* easy to negotiate with when it comes to cost. For example, I'd say a static 4 page website with a simple email/inquiry form would run for $150-$175. That said, I'm not going to overcharge you. You need a project done cheap, I need experience and some money: we can help each other out!

If you're interested, fire me a PM or just email me at zachjgodin@gmail.com! Look forward to hearing from y'all!

Cheers,

Zach Godin"

* internships are a must. get one every summer if you can.

* study what companies have posted as requirements for employment. for instance willow garage (at the time of this posting) wants FPGA guys, which is a strong skill you can develop at CPP. other companies may have jobs posted with skill requirements - do what you can to get those skills while you're in school.

* some companies hire through temp agencies, like aerotek. Get on file at those companies.

others should post other tips they have in the comments"
k981y,9,2011-09-08,It's been almost 3 weeks since I was dumped but I'm still sad and unmotivated. How do I speed this up?,helploveme,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/k981y/its_been_almost_3_weeks_since_i_was_dumped_but_im/,"I was on top of the world a few weeks ago; just came back from a great summer internship that will likely translate into me going to a great graduate school, in a wonderful relationship that went long distance for the summer, about to move into a house off campus for my senior year with a bunch of guys I like, and I decided to move back early to see my girlfriend who lives in the same area as my school. 

The second night I was in town, we have an argument about the future (she was already worried about me leaving for grad school at the end of the year) and about sex (my fault I guess? despite a lot of signs to the contrary she said she wasn't ready and I got upset). We argue most of the next day and though it's resolved, she's distant the next few days. 

I bring up the argument because I figure she still wants to talk about it, and as a result of the subsequent talk/argument she decides that we're breaking up. The next week is filled with angry text messages, a meeting in which we give back each other's stuff, and the slow severing of contact. (I sent some really angry drunk texts that I shouldn't have. I've since deleted her number from my phone.)

I've given up all hope of winning her back at this point, but despite forcing myself into my work and trying to stay positive, this break-up has radiated into the rest of my life and is really taking a toll. I've gotten less patient with my housemates, straining relations with them as we figure out how to live around each other, it's made me incredibly unmotivated to do any work that i'm not required to do (i.e. lab work towards my senior thesis and my grad school applications), and worst of all I just feel sad all the time. 

How do I move on more effectively? I talked with my friends but I don't want to use them too much because I know they'll get sick of it. She and I have a good deal mutual friends so for the time being people have been cool and warned me when she's going to be at an event but I don't want to play that game for the rest of the year.

We're located downtown, have a mix of Windows and Linux servers and a sizable infrastructure in house. An ability to quickly learn, a personable nature and common sense troubleshooting abilities are most important. Experience with CentOS, cfengine, perl, shell scripting and git will help you feel comfortable here. You can expect your standard IT department sysadmin+user support type of work. A background check is needed as is a drug test.

There's always plenty to do, so we're looking for a smart, motivated individual who wants to expand their skillset, not an expert in all things IT.

This is an entry level, intern or part-time position. There's a good chance it could become regular full time. It's a relaxed atmosphere and as flexible as an IT position can be.

kae43,16,2011-09-09,Girlfriend's dad thinks I am using her.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kae43/girlfriends_dad_thinks_i_am_using_her/,"Me and my girlfriend decided to get married and in traditional Indian style (we are both Indian) told our parents about it. Her dad is convinced that I am using her for her money and for getting a greencard (I am here on a student visa while she is a citizen of the US). We love each other deeply and genuinely and my girlfriend does not doubt me for a moment. I have also reiterated that my job will be taking care of my immigration issues and I do not need her help for that. 

Her dad is now not keen on doing our engagement after telling my family and his family that he was OK with everything. He wants me to first get my work permit, etc. before he is going to be 100% satisfied with me. He met me once for 2hrs and has decided that I am exploiting my girlfriend for her money and to get a greencard in this country. He went as far as to call me a f****** piece of s*** in front of his family.

My girlfriend has complete trust in me and she doesn't believe any of the accusations her dad is making. But, she lives at home and her dad yells at her and shouts her down and she is afraid to question him or even state her opinion fearlessly. 

In the midst of this I am lost; I spent the last 6 months trying to find a job near her (she is an medical Intern and she is in a position where she can't move right now) and turned down several good opportunities which would put a fair amount of distance between us. I have done everything to be able to be close to her and meet her on her day off (which can be any day of the week). And I don't regret it -- I thought it through and I did what I did because I knew it would make me and her happy. 

But now I feel she is not standing up for me in front of her dad. He basically hates me and is trying to do anything he can to stop this. He likes to control his family and everything they do and can be verbally abusive with them. And living at home and listening to her dad question my character is making her crazy but she is too afraid/too mild in front of him to say anything assertive. Also her mom never has an opinion and always defers to her dad.

All this is driving me nuts. I have done everything I can to be close to her, to be supportive of her, to be there for her through her crazy intern yr (80hr weeks and she used to call me in tears every day for the first few wks) and I have made it clear that my company will be doing my work permits and greencards (I am a S/W engineer) both to her, her parents and her family. Also, her dad does not like my job and thinks I am not worthy of her since I don't work for any of ""big CS companies"" which according to him begin and end with Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon. I feel very bitter about it and I feel like he is controlling her and wants to control our relationship. 

Am I asking for too much when I say that she needs to stand up for me in front of her dad and tell him that this is unacceptable and that the job I do or the money I make or my visa situation is between me and her since we are two mature adults (I am 28, she is 25)?

Reddit, I am very bitter and angry that she is not standing up for me when her dad is questioning my character. Please tell me if my anger is justified? I am at a loss here. I sit at work and all I think about is this situation. We love each other a lot and all her friends know me and like me. I can't understand what I should do about this. It's not the getting my work permit on my own part that's hurting me, it's the fact that she thinks its reasonable on her dad's part to demand that and postpone all engagement/wedding related activities till that happens that feels like a kick in my gut.

TL;DR: Girlfriends dad thinks I am using her for greencard/money; she does not, but is not standing up for me when he is literally insulting my character and thinks he is being reasonable.

ka71y,2,2011-09-09,I'm applying to law school and was hoping someone might take a look at my Personal Statement.,BatmanBeltandBuckle,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/ka71y/im_applying_to_law_school_and_was_hoping_someone/,"The following is a statement that i will be submitting with my applications, it tells of what my past year has been like, let me know if this is something law schools might be interested in and respond favorable to.

I appreciate any and all commentary.

The concept of a yearlong sabbatical from school either between high school and college or college and graduate school has long been romanticized, my relatives wax reminiscent of a time when they spent only a few nights a week tending bar and would travel to the beach to sun bathe or the mountains to ski; literature tells coming-of-age tales of young men wandering “the city” while film portrays their burgeoning love; My experience however, was drastically different. 

Though I had three credits still required of me to receive my diploma I returned from Indiana in the first week of June in 2010, I intended to spend the summer unencumbered; I wanted an experience like that, that had been recalled so fondly by my father and others.  I spent a modest percent of my time preparing to retake the LSATs in October and worked part time in a local retail establishment.  As autumn approached I began to seek more gainful employment so that I might expedite the transition out of my parents’ home; that search would be short lived.

In the early weeks of September, shortly after my brothers had moved into their Rutgers apartment to start their junior and senior years, respectively, I found an intravenous needle among my brother’s things.  My brother John, the second of three, had developed a heroin problem.  Following this revelation my brother moved home, albeit reluctantly, where he began the arduous process of detoxing and recovering from a drug addiction, and at his insistence he did so without professional assistance.  Due to my unencumbered status I was delegated the task of supervising my brother through this period; my part time job allowed for flexible scheduling so that I could attend to my brother’s needs while he was at home and could accompany him to his various engagements: classes, doctors’ appointments and the occasional social incentive.  I would not leave his side, for more than a few hours for over nine weeks.  Due to the duties I had undertaken I was unable to sit for either the October or December 2010 LSATs.

As my brother’s situation improved I was able to refocus on my own endeavors and because the employment opportunities were not numerous during the holiday season I founded River’s Edge Group, a small-business technology consulting group and on-site technology support service.  Following the inception of the River’s Edge Group I was able to distance myself from the part-time retail position I had held since I returned to New Jersey in June.  My continued efforts to expand and develop my business have provided me with invaluable insight into the world of the small-business-man; I have a more profound appreciation of the dedication it takes to grow and sustain a business.  To date River’s Edge Group, Inc. has revenues in excess of $100,000.00 and a client base that, while small, is growing.

With my financial situation better grounded, both with the revenues from the River’s Edge Group as well as the part-time retail position I still held, I was able to dedicate more of my time to preparing for the June 2011 LSATs; I registered for a Kaplan Test Prep course and began my formal preparation the 26th of March.  Preparation for the LSATs however, was not my singular responsibility; on March 19th it was discovered that my mother had a myxoma, a tumor approximately the size of a golf ball had grown in her left atria, she would need open heart surgery immediately.  On March 24th my mother emerged from surgery, healthy.  Although my mother’s surgery had been a success the road to recovery would be a strenuous one; not only would she require constant assistance to compete even the most basic of tasks, she would need transportation to and from countless medical appointments and the duties she had been responsible for over twenty years would need to be assumed.  Once again I was designated the responsible party; my ad hoc schedule allowed for me to manage my mother’s supervision, medical care and numerous responsibilities; her situation would require constant support through May and into the first weeks of June.  My LSATs came and went and I dedicated the balance of my available time to their preparation.

In the first weeks of May I began contributing to a small political analysis website, Global Power and Strategy analysis, initially as an incited consultant now as a contributor.  From May 31st through August 19th I held a full time internship at NAME OMITTED, a full service law firm located in Morristown, New Jersey.  This experience has provided me with a look into the actual culture of a law firm and strengthened my resolve to pursue a professional legal career.

The sum of my experiences over the past year have brought a number of things to light, the most important is that I must, assume responsibility for myself, like I did for my brother and subsequently my mother.  While I may have been able to feign reasonability during my undergraduate career, my brother’s addiction and my mother’s illness required no less than genuine commitment and reasonability.  Starting my own business has made me responsible for myself in real and empirical terms, if I fail to remain committed to my endeavors, surly they will fail.  The past year has forced me to grow in ways I had not as in undergraduate student.  I am committed to attending law school and anxious to assume the responsibilities that will no doubt accompany such an endeavor.

k9zbl,0,2011-09-09,Honest feedback on my roster please! ,p_U_c_K,fantasyfootball,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/k9zbl/honest_feedback_on_my_roster_please/,"Paid 30 bucks, 10 man league, auction style, $200 a head.

QBs- Brady/Cutler
RBs- Peterson/Gerhart, Michael Turner, Beanie Wells, Marion Barber
WR- Wes Welker, Chad Ocho Cinco, Percy Harvin, Randy Moss, Roy Williams
TEs- Todd Heap, Kyle Rudolph (I'm a vikes fan, and I have a feeling he's gonna be a strong contender for ROY, watch)
K- Mason Crosby GB
D- VIkes

This is a 25 yard per point passing, 4 point per TD QB league. 

What do you guys think? I think I did okay. I'm digging my 1 2 punch with AP and Turner, and think Beanie will surprise a lot of people now that he has the reigns with hightower gone and chester hurt and mainly a third down back (plus, after what he did in CHI last year, or didn't do, I think he is going to be a nonfactor). Barber, while hurt, was tearing it up in the preseason I heard, I would love for him to get back to beast mode, I know people are saying he's done, but fuck man, he's only 28. I'm 27 and despite my love handles I can still rock a 12 minute mile. 

As for Moss, why not, he only cost me 49 dollars (joke, I spent my last dollaridoo on him after some dickface gaffled berrian from me. Holy shit, wow, I just had the worst deva vu of my entire life. Imagine, Brady, with His deep threat (moss) his sideline and over the middle (sometimes, if no one is there to hit him) guy (ocho) and his dump off and run for 15-20 guy (welker), the double point capabilities makes my weiner shift sides. 

As for Rudolph. If anyone here has been watching vikes preseason games they'd know mike mayock would spread his butt cheeks wide open for the dude. I guess he's like the second coming of jermichael finley. A wr in the TE's body in a white commentators buttcrack (mayock). Shiancoe is getting up tehre, and hasn't played a down this preseason, and I know that musgrave likes to run 2 TE sets, and dude has hands and could be a touchdown machine in the red zone, especially inside the 5, I can see a lot of play action roll out tosses to him, since it's well known mcnabb is racist. 

The vikes D was basically a homer move. I don't think we've had an interception since sharper left. But I only had 1 dollar left and regardless of the reality of our LB situation and DB situation, every season preview keeps saying that our defense is elite and going to keep us in games. I don't know how that's possible when one of your LB's is erin henderson, who is no joke a radio station intern and one of your safeties hasn't eaten in a month for ramadan and refuses to touch the football because it's made of a variation of pork. 

Some dudes did auto picks and man, that system needs new code. They ended up with like 5 RB's and still had 65 dollars at the end of the draft. They must've done a number on their rating system. I don't think I have much competition, here's the other squads, let me know what you guys think of them (as in, who is best, worst, etc.)

k9z86,1,2011-09-09,IAmA very unhappy person who had to write this out,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/k9z86/iama_very_unhappy_person_who_had_to_write_this_out/,"I cant sleep, its 4am and i just cracked a beer out of reflex. Hopefully i dont come off as melodramatic in this, but i had to write it all down because im so very confused. I cant really talk to anyone about whats been going on with me, so hopefully the internet will have some fatherly advice/guidance for me.

I got into a relationship that lasted about 2 years, towards the end i started to put some very strange coincidental things together that led me to believe my girlfriend cheated on me awhile back, and was now cheating on me with someone else. This was never made obvious, I could only put odd things together. I dont know how to phrase it exactly- but it was almost prophesied (ask me to elaborate and ill explain why i used that word). I never had the evidence or situation where i could talk about it openly without some sort of backlash about me not trusting her, this drove me insane. I became heavily depressed from here and i began to smoke or drink everyday.

Surprisingly, im over the fact that i was cheated on. I look back with disgust at the class of people i was associating with through her. Nonetheless how it all ended really took its toll on my physiologically. It's made me fuck up a lot of things, so if you get a kick out of that I suggest you keep reading.

I showed up at her place, we were celebrating her sister's birthday. They made sure i was drunk and high for this shit, and i couldn't say no. I was getting strategically fucked with while sedated, i had no idea how to react. They did everything they could to isolate me from conversation, they would speak their language unless they wanted me to hear something. They were trying very hard to convey that i wasn't part of the family. We were eating appetizers, bread; i had my share and i was offered more from another batch and i politely refused. I was told to eat it by my ex'es fiancee, who i considered a brother and vise versa not too long ago. My mouth became so dry i could barely talk. We went down to play ping pong with her father and the fiancee- I played a few then sat out, they began trying to indirectly hit me with the ball. I took notice and i went up stairs; I am then told to start the barbecue. No problem. Turn it on, wait, wait some more. Im outside alone at this point- i briskly come back in; leaving it on- ask if someone is going to throw the chicken on- then i realize they are fucking with me so i turn it back off. The fiancee and the father then tend to it without me, i come back out to see if i can help- and they just walked away pretty much. I get to talking to them eventually, im getting insulted indirectly again; i get fingered by the fiancee who is scratching his face.

I go to the kitchen and idle. I overhear my girlfriend talking about people i dont know. More shit happens, but it ends up with me downstairs and her yelling everything she is saying so her grandparents and her family can hear from upstairs. Her sister comes down to talk to me, im confused as to why the fuck she would get involved- and she has this smug fucking look over her face the entire time that i wil always remember. At this point, I cant talk my way out of anything; my mouth is dry, im high and drunk- and im in a situation where the outcome is going to be bad regardless. The fiancee follows me outside as I attempt to leave, we walk to the park where there is this conveniently placed purple bike in a clearing. Im speechless at this point and leave before a car pulls up to the side of the road.

I leave because I dont want to follow their plan anymore.

The next day I have her over, we talk for an hour, her poorly hinting that the relationship is dead- I rage fuck her for 5 minutes, something told me to do this because i feel like i've been fucked over. We talk for another 10, I blurt out 'im sick of it'. I wish i savoured it more, but she leaves immediately. I never got to tell her how fucking terrible her family is. I never had the chance to express my hate- and because i wasn't a coward about it. Which really gets to me. She puts me through a physiological gangbang that her and her entire inbred family gets to take part in, but I didn't get the chance to put her through her share.

Soon after i find myself interning at a place full of professionals that i respect. I have to learn a program, but i dont learn it enough because im drinking or smoking everyday at this point. A month passes by after a series of awkward introductions and amateur mistakes, im laid off because I kept fucking up. Im very good at what i do, and i got the internship for a reason, but i managed to look like a complete idiot throughout because i couldn't stop thinking about what i would say to my ex.

But in the middle of my internship I was taken out with a friend who introduced me to this beautiful actress. We hit it off and I felt like I was going to be happy soon. We go to the beach, and drink a bottle of wine watching the sunset. We head back to her place, and pick up another bottle of wine, and I pretty much clear the thing.

I black out in her bed, probably for a while. I remember waking up after a series of strange dreams, I somehow still manage to talk myself into a second date but in the morning she changes her mind. This acted as a catalyst for my failure.

From this point on, i've blacked out 2 other times within a month and I dont know my limit anymore.

I get around to hanging out with my friends more, but i fear a few (yes, a few) of them might be gay, because i feel like im getting hit on all the time. If they are gay thats fine- but i sure as fuck dont like getting hit on by my friends because i have no idea how to react. This has only started happening as of recent.

I really have no one to talk to, so if you have anything to say i would really appreciate it, and if you've read this i fucking love you.

tl;dr physiologically raped, failure ensues- friends gay?"
kbgpo,2,2011-09-10,How do I deal with this woman?!,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/kbgpo/how_do_i_deal_with_this_woman/,"Hello Reddit - first post and I hope it's in the right sub.

About 8 months ago I started dating my boyfriend online and it advanced to me moving to his city in western Canada to look for work. It seemed ideal since he had the basement suite of his house to himself, which was completely private and separate from the other floors of the house. Was. 

I successfully completed my IT internship in eastern Canada before excitedly booking my plane tickets for the week after my birthday in April. Things were going really well and our communication was really solid, even with it having been online. 

For the first two months or so I got along with everyone great, met the family and some extended family. I did, however, begin to notice that his sister who still lives at home had a few mental health problems which began to get worse but his mother always tried to shush it up or play it off as no big deal. I have no experience with this but having researched online it seems quiet a lot like bi polar disorder, in an extreme case. She would be lovely to me one second and call me a whore/slut/etc. the next. Her mother, who was being very nice to me before this began to go through my personal belongings such as my laptop. Upon not finding anything she proceeded to make things up to my boyfriend about me speaking to other men or keeping my past a secret from him (I was previously married, he knows that). This escalated to a point in August where upon coming home from my part-time barista job I found my boyfriend's grandmother dead on the main floor of the house. I did not panic, I dealt with everything as best as I could that way and supported his mum and his sister through all of it. Including making the memorium, helping to choose location, flowers, clergy, thank you notes. All with no thanks in return.

Despite helping and being supportive, my living situation has got worse. His sister has a habit of opening the door to the suite and shouting obscenities at me as well as making up bizarre lies like ""she was out talking to the mailman this morning you better watch it your girlfriend is such a slut!!"". His mother began gambling again and took me along with her twice as I didn't have a choice being on the other side of the city in a dodgy area without a vehicle. About four years ago she ran into major trouble and gambled away over 430 grand of her inheritance. I didn't want to see that happen again and told my boyfriend who tried to bring it up to her as calmly as he could.

Huge mistake? 

She cornered me on the way to pay a bill about a week ago and started screaming, pounding the back of the car seat, calling me an untrustworthy slut, whore, useless, that I should go die. When the car stopped she got out of the backseat and made a motion to clock me one in the face. Kept screaming about how I've ruined her relationship with her son (insert more batshit crazy stuff here). I'm fully aware that this is not normal behaviour in any person, let alone an adult and since then things have escalated. I don't feel particularly safe on my own in this house. My boyfriend is lovely and has stood by me in everything but we cannot afford to get our own place in such an expensive city until I get a full time job. He is appealing to me to ""just ignore it"" which is extremely difficult.

And so my question is - WTH can I reasonably do ? 

TL;DR : My boyfriends family is batshit crazy. "
kdj16,3,2011-09-12,My inexperience is holding me back,needinsomehelp,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kdj16/my_inexperience_is_holding_me_back/,"So I had been dating a girl for a little over a year and a half (my first girlfriend, 2nd girl I ever had sex with; she had a few short term relationships and had been with quite a few guys). Just as summer was approaching, our relationship started to become rocky, as we both started taking each other for granted. I went away on an internship, and things only got worse.

She started asking to go on an ""unexclusive break"", which to me just sounded like she wanted to fuck other guys. This made me break up with her. It was really hard for a little while, but eventually I got used to the idea of being alone.

When I got back to school, we started hanging out again, and generally started acting like a couple. I love this girl, and want to start dating again, but I just can't. While we were separated, she hooked up with 3 different guys (more people than I've been with including her) while I felt like I wasn't ready to do that. 

She wants to get back together, and I do too, but everytime I'm with her, all I can think about is the other guys shes been with. I don't hate her for what she did, I'm just jealous. I don't think I could ever go back to her without going out and hooking up with other girls, but the thought of her doing the same is destroying me. 

Getting back with her now feels like I'd just be too focused on what shes done, and would eventually sabotage our relationship, but being apart just feels wrong. What should I do?"
kd4br,1,2011-09-12,Would it be helpful to have a place that compiles the web sites that Redditors generally disapprove of?,OmegaSeven,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kd4br/would_it_be_helpful_to_have_a_place_that_compiles/,"What I'm thinking is to have a list somewhere that could give a clue to new users as to what sites are generally frowned upon and why.

I've been here close to six months now and this is what I've figured out so far, I doubt it's an exhaustive list and please correct me where I'm wrong.

* Funyjunk: disliked for users posting unaccredited (sometimes slightly modified) content from Reddit and other sited and then initially refusing to rectify the situation. The Oatmeal seemed to be a major focus of this controversy.

* The ""Cheezeburger"" network: Similarly posting content from other websites without attribution to the original source.

* The Gawker family of websites: The opinion seems to be that the content on these sights is generally poor, the recent layout changes are annoying and that apparently some of the interns they hire have poor dating etiquette.

* Social Networks: I see a growing consensus that screen captures of arguments or funny occurrences on social networking sites (such as Facebook) aren't very popular. I think the jury is still out on this one and it really depends on what community you are posting in.

* Political Blogs: There also seems to be pretty healthy debate regarding certain political web sites. This one's harder to put my finger on and might just be a factor of disliking differing opinions.

The reason I'm writing this post is, if nothing else, is to attempt to generally not piss people off. I know this won't solve any real problems but it might give newer users such as myself a place to look for this kind of information should they seek it. "

We will be flying out to see each other (sometimes she'll be flying here, I'll go up there other times) every so often, which can get expensive.  So, I'd like to know if there are any places that have helped you save money in the past.

Also, I have plenty of money saved up from working both a full-time and part-time job the past two summers as a high school student (OK, the full time one was technically an internship.  A very high paying engineering internship).  I was thinking I could use some of that for our travel expenses (she never worked much in high school, but might be getting a part time job soon), but she doesn't want me to pay for her.  I honestly don't think it's a big deal, since the flight is as much for my benefit as it is for hers.  If she can find a way to get the flight paid for, then I'm OK, unless if it puts her in a bad financial situation, but I don't want it to be a reason to not see each other.  Any ideas on how to deal with this?"
kcqs5,1,2011-09-12,LD issues and a whole bunch of questions.,[deleted],relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/kcqs5/ld_issues_and_a_whole_bunch_of_questions/,"This will probably be lengthy, so I apologize in advance, but I feel like it needs to be to accurately describe the situation in order to get helpful advice and opinions.

My manfriend and I have been dating for over 2 years now, but a lot of it has been long distance. We met doing an internship and were together nonstop for 6 months, but then had to separate to go back to our respective schools. We still dated. I had done LD before and he hadn't, but it wasn't too terrible. Then he lived with me over the following summer. We parted again, ended up breaking up for a few months, and then got back together. It just didn't feel right when we were apart, he said and I agreed. I lived with him this past summer and everything was awesome, but parting again was really difficult.

Alright, I have a bunch of questions, I guess.

He's an amazing, attentive, and supportive partner when we are actually together. When we are LD, he doesn't have time for me and sometimes I end up feeling like a burden. He'll call me at night to say goodnight before bed, but really only seems to like the call when I act happy and like I don't have a care in the world. When I have an actual problem, like missing him, I feel like I'm ""harshing his mellow"" and so less and less do I feel like I'm able to share my problems when I have them (not all that often, but this in and of itself is making it worse) with him. Should I kind of fake being happy to keep the calls light and him feeling like he's not making my life more sad? Should I always tell him the truth and sometimes it bring him down?

I'm about to graduate in December and he still has 3 and a half years of school (late to his major, etc.). I'm willing to move across the country to be with him and after a lot of consideration, I think it's what I want to do. I'd be fine living in an apartment in the same town and getting a job doing something that I finally enjoy! Sounds like a good time to me. But every time I try to talk to him about it, he doesn't sound enthusiastic. I feel like I'm the one making a slight sacrifice and he should be happier that I want to do it. Pretty much, he makes me feel rather unwanted and I'm sure it's not what he's trying to do, but it's how it comes across. I've told him that in the past and he told me that he worries that I'll come, not be able to find something, and end up failing. I try to take it as his concern, but in the end, I just feel like a burden. Should I just get over it and try to be okay and just go on with my plan? Or should I reconsider and re-evaluate his investment in the relationship?

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, sometimes I just need to vent. Almost all of my friends are male and I'm female (I hope that's not a surprise by now). I feel like I can't really talk to them about what I'm going through because every time I've tried so far, one by one they've made it clear that they would rather that he and I break up so that I could date them. That's not really the advice I'm looking for, so should I just stop trying to ever talk about it (even when my guyfriends bring it up)? I've made it clear to each and every one of them that I'm not going to date them, but it seems like they'd rather give me an easy pass out of the relationship than try to actually help me talk through or solve my issues."
kclwa,2,2011-09-11,"2 months since break-up, cant stop thinking about her.",postbreakupblues,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/kclwa/2_months_since_breakup_cant_stop_thinking_about/,"Hello reddit, I've got noone else to ask for advice, so I've come to you.

I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 17 months, (I am 21[M], she was 19[F]), I was head over heels in love, and i was her first boyfriend and she loved me even more (thats what she used to joke about anyway). We broke up on ""mutual"" terms, as in she thought it best to break up, because she wanted a job in the alps for 6 months and didnt think we would last being apart for so long, and i was supportive, as thats the only thing i could be. But i made it clear, i didnt want to break-up.

Anyway, turns out she never applied for the job but ""looked around"" but she maintains that she doesnt want a relationship anymore, and that i go to Uni too far away to make it carry on working.

Basically, the problem I am having is moving on. I'm not a very out-going person, give me a few beers and i can make a room chuckle and appear to be doing well, but inside i am a complete mess of anxiety and worrying what people think of me, so im scared of trying to move on in the rebound sense.

What also is a problem, is she still wants to be friends, and says she still loves me, and misses me. But she keeps saying she doesnt want a relationship.

Ive tried saying ""I cant do this, i need my space if you truly dont want a relationship, so i can move on"" she appears to understand and we wont text for 12-48 hours but then somehow we always end up talking again.

I loved/love her and dont know how to live without her, I think of her every moment of every day and miss all the little things, the comfort of a relationship etc.

Since i was young ive always struggled with depression, it hits hardest when going through mourning or when im very upset. This past year has been incredibly hard for me, ive lost 2 grandparents, but my girlfriend was always there to help me. However 3 weeks after we broke up, my mother was diagnosed with bowel cancer, and I told my ex, and she is worried about me and doesnt want to not talk to me, incase i do something ""stupid"". Everything in my life seems to be spinning out of control, ive got no motivation to work, and missed out on a Pixar Internship, i had a severe mental breakdown after my mum was diagnosed and missed my flight to a holiday and I just dont know what to do anymore.

I took a big step today, and asked my ex to stop contact completely and remove me from facebook, as i dont have the guts to do it myself. She doesnt want to but says she will tomorrow if is till want her to... The decision to ask her to do this is killing me, and i want to tell her dont lets keep talking, but i also want to move on :( So thats why ive come to you reddit, how on earth do i move on and start getting my life on track?

TL;DR - Broke up with my gf 2 months ago, finding it hard to move on, cant stop thinking about her, lots of rl problems making me depressed and all i want is her to take me back - How can I move on, and get my life back on track?

Thank you for reading x

These people are between 70-100 years old and a lot of them suffer from dementia. The only things that many of them can remember are Psalms and bible verses. 

At first I was like ""Wow, maybe in this case religion is sort of all these people can understand and relate to and it is a comfort for them at their end of life"" so I let it be. Today I started getting to know more of them and HOLY SHIT.. One person showed me where in the bible it forbids pants for women and she has worn a skirt her entire life (NEVER PANTS ONCE!!!!) and refuses to go to a church where women are allowed to wear pants.. So indoctrinated that she is for repressing  her own gender. (She was not senile, btw) Another told me that because god put sugar on the earth it is okay to have as much as you want and was serious.. and another told me that we have to go somewhere when we die, it only makes sense, and that he hadn't watched the tv or news paper in 40 years.. he just needs his bible. A nun told me I looked ""loose"" after I introduced myself (wtf?) and demanded I put on a crucifix before I speak to her anymore. Finally, when asked if they wanted dentures, they declined, saying if they died with anything artificial God would not let them into heaven. Aside from the nun all of these people are pretty together mentally. Religion isn't helping them, it is just making their lives fucking harder. They are so indoctrinated that I hear over and over that many think saying GOD DAMMIT will send them to hell for eternity. I dont even live in a very religious area, I just think that generation is super religious. Regardless, I love the elderly and I will suck it up and listen to them talk about how much they love Jeebus because it makes their day better and just lawl inside. Just wanted to vent. "

ke2qi,65,2011-09-13,I Am Dating A Hardcore Gay Republican....And I'm Not Sure Whether To Stay Together With Him Because He Supports Anti-Gay Politicians.,ConfusedGayBoy,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/ke2qi/i_am_dating_a_hardcore_gay_republicanand_im_not/,"LGBT Redditors:

I'm currently senior year college student in D.C.

I'm dating an older guy who's two years old than me. 

He's very sweet, good-looking, charming and has a good sense of humor. He's astoundingly good in bed as well. 

And he's a Republican. 

Not a moderate Republican. Not a 'liberal' Republican.

No, he works on Capital Hill with Republican Senators &amp; Congressmen.

I consider myself politically moderate and try to keep politics out of our relationship.

But I intern at an LGBT non-profit in D.C. and he works for anti-gay Republicans. So, politics inevitably come up when we're both passionate about our issues.

He stated many times that he would support any Republican who ousts Obama from the White House. This I don't particularly mind. Lots of Democrats don't like Obama either.

However, he would even support Michelle Bachmann or Rick Santorum. In fact, he LIKES them. Alot. He even volunteered to help with their presidential campaign during the summer.

I brought up their anti-gay agendas constantly but he waves it off as ""unimportant"" or ""not an important issue right now. Focus on the economy"". He's perfectly aware of their bigotry...but he doesn't care. He supports them regardless.

I finally sat him down and asked him how he could vote for anti-gay Republicans (much less work for them) and he dodged the issue by deflecting blame to Democrats and stating that he's more than ""one issue"" and what matters is ""saving the country from Obamanomics"". 

The height of his hypocrisy was when he came to a LGBT fundraiser I helped organized to support gay marriage rights in other states (particularly in North Carolina). He smiled and chatted with everyone. He even donated $300 of his own money to the charity while he posed with my co-workers for pictures.

He then went to another fundraiser the next week sponsored by the National Marriage Association where he worked with his Congressman to donate money to their organization. He helped both sides donate money to their agendas. I confronted him on this and he just rolled his eyes and changed the subject. 

I don't believe he particularly CARES about gay rights. He likes it when pro-gay rights laws are passed and shrugs his shoulders when anti-gay rights laws are passed. 

He doesn't come from a religious background but he does come from wealthy background as his parents live in Georgetown and have multiple homes on the East Coast. I'm not sure if his economic background plays a role in his political views. 

I DO like him. But I can't help but feel sometimes I've fallen for a snake. My gay friends refuse to associate with him (my boyfriend had an ENORMOUS argument with them that led to thrown beer bottles...) and seem to distance themselves from me for dating him. I've hung out with his other gay Republican friends and they all seem to share his views. One of them works for GOProud. 

I have a terrible moral dilemma. I'm in a relationship with someone who actively supports and backs anti-gay bigots who seek to destroy everything I work for and have a passion for. 

I asked him what would happen if we stayed together and decided to get married and DOMA was passed. He said he'd just hire a lawyer to get the 'equivalent rights' we would have under a normal marriage. I didn't like that answer.

Should I consider breaking up with him or should I try to see past his politics and see the charming man I fell for? 

**TLDR; Dating a gay Republican who works for anti-gay Republicans who are against everything I work for at a LGBT non-profit. **

**EDIT : WOW! So many responses! Thanks everyone for the advice! I'm currently working on the NC marriage debacle in Raleigh so I haven't had a chance to log in recently. I haven't come to a decision as of yet. I will talk to my friends and my bf to settle this once and for all. I'll try to reply to as many of you as po**ssible."

I think i need a pair of new eyes to take a look at my situation cause it s going on for a long time and i m quite sick of loosing my time and my feelings on this.

I m 24 and i was with the same girl for 4 years in a relationship, i finished my engeneering studies and i had to move out of our city to find an internship and start working, she had a few years of studies left so she stayed there to finish it. 

We broke up few month later but we stayed very very closed, we continue to see each other, had sexy time and even had hollidays together, i took her for a trip in holland and another time to poland. She was seeing other guys, not seriously though, not even having sex with them, i was seeing other girls as well but still when we were together we were kinda a couple.

A year later she begin a new relationship with another guy, a guy without any ambition, a morron, but a guy wich is fun in partys and living in the same city she was. There are still photos of us in her apartment, i m still invitied to family dinners at her parents home, i sleep at here place, we kiss occasionaly when we are a bit drunk, she called me a few times to say that she still loved me, and made me a big photo album of one of our trips to japan but she is with another guy that she loves obvisouly. 

I loved/love her deeply, i was thinking that maybe later when she finishes her studies we will be back together so i was ok with it, we can make our own experiences on our side and be back together for a serious relationship after it.

But now times is passing and every time i see her i feel bad about it after it, i feel a bit sad.I don t know how to feel about all this any more. 

We call eachother, we talk a lot, she complains often about her bf and stuff but i feel that i m loosing my time here, that i m betting on the wrong girl and that we may never be together anymore and so i have to move on, but i can t decide myself to get over it.

What do you think ? I m not desperate, i have fun with other girls but i feel i can t fall in love anymore. "
kf83z,7,2011-09-14,Screw the title.,rantingandraving,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kf83z/screw_the_title/,"I'll admit it. I'm STILL depressed. I'm still wallowing in self-loathing, repressed anger, and bouts of numbness. I've gotten worse at hiding it. My panic disorder is apparently in remission, but I don't know when I'll get another attack.

It's hard to deal with all of this. But I keep going. I'm not suicidal, no. It's just...difficult to deal with all this *crap*. Disabled epileptic dad, passive-aggressive hoarder mom with a brain tumor, little sister in need of an MRI...and envy. So much fucking envy.

Yeah, you guys grew up in this house too. You know how rough it is here sometimes. Lack of a daily shower, scraping together change for a burger when money runs low, the rare seizure, *being stuck in this town*...but you guys made it out. You did well in school and made it out of this rat hole ""city"" and got degrees and honors and awards and internships and jobs and apartments. 

You, the oldest sister, all prim and proper...you got in to some of the most selective schools in the country, you got a nearly free ride, fellowships, connections, you went abroad and wrote a book. You didn't get bullied in high school.

And you, the second oldest. Yeah, you dropped out and got your GED, just like I did. But you didn't fail your first semester of college. You weren't forced to withdraw from school due to uncontrolled panic attacks and PTSD. You finished and transferred out to a better school. 

I'm stuck. I can't get out. I don't have the grades, the GPA, or the test scores to get into a small cheap state school. I can't afford to move out, because I can't get a job. Even community colleges are too expensive, even with full grants.

But I guess that's my fault. I'm the one that couldn't deal with typical high school. I'm the one that let my grades slip just because I was BORED and SAD. I'm the one that partied the night before my SAT's. I'm the one that transferred to school after school, getting progressively more bored and more fed up with the system. I'm the one that dated the rapist. I'm the one that failed my classes and dropped out because I couldn't fucking handle it, losing the tuition waiver I'd been offered. I'm the one that let myself get so stressed out I failed my first semester of college and now they WON'T LET ME COME BACK. I failed I fail I FAILED AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

And that's why I'm stuck here. Because I kept giving up, because I didn't try to at least pay attention and do my work in classes I could've aced with ease. I killed my brain with reckless behavior and self-endangerment and sheer APATHY. I'm living with the consequences and it sucks, it sucks so much, even more so because I know what happened. I KNOW what went wrong, and it was my fault. It really was.

Now I'm just a deadbeat 19-year-old sitting in a corner staring at a screen, day after day after day just wallowing in my own filthy waste. Dirty dishes, moldy dishes, paper, crumbs, empty chip bags, pizza boxes, filthy clothes and alcohol bottles, random shit that I don't even recognize, and it's all piled up to my waist. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why didn't I just brush it all off? The milk on my pants, the words on my lockers, the spit in my food, the bars of soap on my desk, the pushing and shoving and laughing and tripping and books to the face and papers all over the floor and the hands, smiles, hair-pulling, teeth, kicks, punches, blood and blood over and over and over and over god dammit why couldn't I just BRUSH IT OFF and FORGET and get through it? Why couldn't I just get through it? I hate myself. I hate them. I hate ***him***. 

And I envy you. I really do. It makes me feel sick to say it. I wish that you could understand the shit I've gone through, what I'm going through. Death and loss and abuse and pain and apathy and just god DAMMIT why do I sound so EMO?!

But I'm still trying. I'll throw myself into massive amounts of debt if I have to, just to get out of here and remake my life and heal. I am not down for the count. I will get back up and finish this fight even if it kills me. I WILL get into school, and I WILL kick ass and I WILL transfer into Amherst College with a 3.8+. *Even if it kills me.*"

kh08f,9,2011-09-15,It's his birthday on Tuesday...,vagabondchilequeen,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/kh08f/its_his_birthday_on_tuesday/,"My dad died in May this year. 

To give a little back story: 

There has always been random family drama in my life, but I never felt like I had the right to get upset or too hard on myself because I wasn't physically harmed, and I know people had it worse then me. Basically my parents went through a bad divorce, my sisters and I were not left out of the drama. I was only 7 at the time, but I still remember screaming, my mom sleeping on the couch, broken dishes, etc. Fast forward a few years... My mom is dating a man who does not know how to deal with girls. For example, he never wanted all three of us over to his house at once. Only two at a time max. Then after a bit my dad started dating a woman who did not get along with us either. Things were bad on both ends, and we were getting shuffled around moving from house to house every two weeks. 

Things really weren't good for any of us. My mom and dad couldn't even speak to each other on the phone, they would give us letters to give each other. Each of them would talk shit about each other to us, leaving us in an awkward position constantly. Anyway, come my 8th grade year, which I will remember as one of the worst years of my life. This is the year my mom got married to my step-dad without telling us, my friends took me to the guidance counselor telling me I wasn't being a ""good friend"", and things got so bad between my step mom, dad and myself that I got kicked out of my house. 

So here I am 13, feeling betrayed by my parents, and my friends abandoned me. 

I'm not going to go into my whole high school years, but basically my dad and I had very little communication that whole time. I remember the first year or so we only saw each other a couple times, and I would be the one who needed to call him. The only time I would hear from him was to email me about my grades (he got email updates). While this was happening my step-dad moved across the country and my mom was spending time in between her house and his. My sisters could go to my dads, but often I would be left alone or with my grandparents. 

Anyway, I graduate from high school and continue on with my life. At this point I have learned to depend on my parents for little, and had distanced myself emotionally. 

I had held this resentment toward my dad for so long, but getting into college and stepping outside of those emotions allowed me to see things from his perspective. My dad had a rough childhood with a dad who showed little emotion, beat him, and kept a strict household. Understanding more of his side of things helped our relationship to slowly grow. 

My dad was always a motivator despite our differences, so I would always do well and that drive to succeed has stuck with me. I have become fiercely independent and I began creating my own personal successes. I was getting internships, getting good grades in school, traveling, meeting some amazing friends. 

In the end, it has only been in this past year that the relationship my dad and I have been working on for so long, finally started to come together. I finally felt like we understood each other. He knew my passions, and I knew his. Anytime we got together we had amazing conversation, and I never had someone to turn to like I did him. 

So like I said earlier he passed away in may due to a pulmonary embolism. Sudden and unexpected. I know this is long-winded and I really am not even sure why I am posting on reddit, but today I'm feeling a little lost. Two weeks after my dad died I moved away for an internship, and now I've moved again 2 weeks ago to another country to study abroad. I am keeping busy, and living life exactly how he would've wanted me to. There are just so many unanswered questions, and this is something I never thought I would have to deal with. I just hope my dad knew how much I loved him and how much he really meant to me, and there was a time where I never thought I would be able to say that. 

tl dr; My dad died in May. We had a strained relationship until right before his passing, and I'm feeling lost. "

I was basically in a high value position at the time because tons of people were asking me questions / about my internships / advice, talking to a lot of girls too.  I meet her and get her name but didn't want to game her then (still during orientation week for the freshmen).

Two weeks later I'm at an audition and she opens me (she remembered  my name). Lots of gazing / light conversation and kino during auditions. She bailed half way through (which I teased her about) but I  didn't have time to # close before she left. So I friended her on fb and sent a message: (about 6 - 12 hrs between each of our replies)
me: ""way to pussy out!""
her: ""hahaha how were the rest of auditions?""
me: ""they were fun! you should have stayed. what'd you do the rest of the day anyway?""
her: ""ummm I don't really know. homework I think""
me: ""you nerd! looks like you need a study break. let's get a meal sometime. btw I don't think I have your number""

so she gives me her number (yesterday) and I haven't followed up yet.

What are my next steps? I haven't texted her yet. 
""getting a meal"" sounded pretty weak but at this point I don't know very much about her so I can't think of any other ideas to hang out. My plan was to get a meal, learn more about her, and then plan something fun. How do I demonstrate interest throughout this though? I'm afraid that just grabbing dinner together is already framing myself in her mind as a friend.  I was thinking possibly meal + then just wandering the city and getting desert?

What did I do right, and what could I have improved on?"
kg7oh,1,2011-09-15,Reddit help me make sense of this breakup ,jimbean21,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/kg7oh/reddit_help_me_make_sense_of_this_breakup/,"Sorry for the length, I just wanted to paint a full picture. 

My ex (let us call her Kate) and are I both 21 year old seniors in college who met during our sophomore year (we would end of dating for 1.5 years). We lived on the same apartment floor and our roommates quickly became friends. She took an interest me first, which I was oblivious to. I was initially skeptical about dating Kate because she was considered by my roommates to be too much of a partier, and a bit wild.  Although this was true, she was actually a very sweet girl. Kate’s roommates insisted that she give up on me because of how slow I was moving but Kate waited it out. We officially began dating in March and both of us were thrilled, I should note that Kate was my first gf.

Throughout the rest of the year things went well between Kate and I. She did have a bit of a drinking problem that made me nervous. When Kate drinks, she will often black out. This has led to some embarrassing moments such as her breast slipping out of her dress, urinating in my bed and so on.  As the semester, ended Kate and I promised to visit each other as often as possible since we only are two hours apart.

The first major incident occurred while Kate was on a school-sponsored trip. She had blacked out and made out with another guy. Her roommates would later inform me that she was so drunk that they were concerned for her safety. Kate called me the next morning sobbing, and explained what had happened.  She told me how sorry she was, and that I had every right to end the relationship. I listened to what she had to say and told her that I would need to think about the situation.  I called her back to let her know that I thought we could still salvage the relationship; she left the trip early to return home.  Once she returned we met up and were able to work past the situation.

Kate texted me on our six-month anniversary, that she wanted to talk. She informed that she wanted to take a break because she felt that I was not giving her enough attention, or showing my love. We didn’t talk for a two days until I finally messaged her on facebook asking how she was doing. She said that the break was had been very hard for her. I suggested that we go on a walk and she agreed. During that walk, we were able to work things out. Kate’s drinking appeared to be a litter milder than the previous year, but she would still blackout and again during the winter she kissed another guy. Apparently, the guy had actually kissed her but Kate hadn’t known until her roommates told her. Kate told me about what had happened and again was crying. I was upset that she got so drunk and put herself in that situation. I eventually forgave her and the rest of the semester went smoothly. Kate would stay at school during the summer for an internship while I went back home, this increased our distance apart to five hours.

The summer was going smoothly and I visited Kate in June. When I arrived, Kate was a bit off, she would describe it as being nervous after having not seen me since early May. We had a great weekend, and again everything was going good. Kate called me saying that she had been thinking and she thought we should break up. She had felt that we were more like best friends, and there wasn’t much passion (despite having and amazing sex life). I was troubled by this but what could I do. She asked if we could still be friends and my exact words were “unlikely” I just didn’t think it was possible after being so close.  Within a week, Kate was back to texting me daily, especially about her brother who had been thrown out of the house. I told her that she needed to make up her mind about us because we were still communicating like a couple. Kate said her feelings were still mixed and she needed time to sort through things. 

A week before school started I visited Kate at her home and we had a fantastic day together. Right before I left she said that she was sure she wanted to be with me, and once again, we were back together.  Our senior year began and things were going good until I looked through her phone and saw a text between her and a friend. The friend had asked how we were doing and Kate said that she thought relationship hadn’t been the same. I brought this up without letting Kate know that I read the text. We agreed to end the relationship despite how close we were. She cried and then we took a drive to a local park where she carved our initials into a wooden gazebo. On the walk back home, I broke down and started crying, this had been my first true relationship and this girl meant the world to me.  She was actually surprised that I cried because I am not emotional but she was relieved to see that I cared so much.

Kate and I stilled talked, a few days later I got a call from her around midnight. Apparently, she had been very upset about our breakup and had been crying for the past few days, her roommates were not supportive. Kate had been crying in a bar and was upset because her friends had left her in the bathroom. I decided to walk her home during which time she sent several mean texts to her roommates. This would lead to a fight amongst the girls and during the weekend, Kate and I hung out and seemed to rekindle our relationship. She talked about how far I thought our relationship could go, and even talked about kids which freaked me out a bit. She would have a long talk with her roommates about the fight on Sunday. On Monday, I received the “can we talk” text again. This time Kate said she wanted to take another break to focus on herself and her drinking. Her roommates (who like me) said that she always has a guy in her life to use as an emotional crutch. Kate believed this to be true and wanted to go through this alone. I accepted her wishes and gave her space until she started texting and talking to me on g-chat after a day or two.  During one of the talks, I asked her if she would want to pick up where we left off after she dealt with her problems; her response was “I would love to.” 

Now here is where all hell breaks loose. Last Thursday I receive a text from one of my roommates that Kate is at a bar dancing and making out with another guy.  Apparently, while a few of my friends were staring at her she made eye contact with them, then grabbed the guy’s face and started kissing him again. I ran to the bar and just stared at her, she looked right back but didn’t even flinch. I was extremely upset and felt like my heart had exploded. I sent her a text saying, “well you got over me fast.” My roommates and a few other friends sat me down once the bar closed and explained how sorry they were. They told me how much they hated Kate for the way that she had treated me in the past, and how they witnessed Kate make out with two guys during the Summer but didn’t have the heart to tell me (technically we weren’t dating). The next morning she responds by saying that I have it all wrong and that we should talk after class. 

After class, we start talking and she seems annoyed to discuss the situation. I asked her what had happened and could not get a straight answer, she said she never meant for it to go that far, and she had been crying all morning. She then says that she’s a disrespectful person and has been disrespectful to me, also that I should have some self-respect and treat her like a “douche” which is what my friends had been doing (roommate texted her fuck you after the bar had closed).  I was at a loss for words and just walked away.  Throughout the weekend, I saw her with the same guy who turned out to be a coworker and not a student at our university. They were dancing very close and kissing while I was dying on the inside. I sent a few text messages asking Kate to talk with me one more time just for closure. She finally responded on Sunday, and we talked on the phone. Again, she was annoyed and asked why I kept texting her (sent 3 text messages), I told her that I just wanted some closure. I told her that the worst part was that she didn’t even seem to care that our friendship/relationship was destroyed. Kate said that it had been hard on her as well but talking about it would only make it worse. She said she had avoided me to give me space so that we both could move on. I would later find out that her coworker had slept over Saturday night. Yesterday, she added him on facebook and defriended me.  This whole situation has left me dumbfounded; I can’t imagine how we went from talking about our future after college and even kids, to this. 

TL;DR Girlfriend and I decide to take break during which she decides get involved with a coworker. 

Well reddit this is my story. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.

kg62s,8,2011-09-15,An introduction of sorts/coming out of lurkerdom/acceptance of my status as probably the most nauseating LDR cliché,cynicalquixotic,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/kg62s/an_introduction_of_sortscoming_out_of/,"Hello hello, everyone.  My name is cynicalquixotic, and I'm an American girl (20) who fell in love with a Frenchman (27) while studying abroad in Paris.

I came to Paris last May as part of Boston University's Paris Internship Program, where I was placed working the desk at a dance studio (I'm a modern dancer, so I was beyond thrilled about this).  I've studied French since I was 11, have been to Paris once before, and have always been fairly good at speaking French.  Even though I very quickly realized that spoken French is almost a different language and I stuck out like a sore thumb as maybe not an Ugly American, but definitely Not French, Paris agreed with me--I loved my internship, found a café with a patron who was amused by Anglophones and would correct my pronunciation errors, and in general I just watched people a lot and tried to immerse myself as fully as I could in this culture that was frustrating and interesting and wonderful.  I know I sound cheesy as hell, but I had never been so happy.  I didn't think it could get any better.

The boy and I met over OKCupid in mid-June--I had changed my city from New York to Paris and was browsing it on a whim--and when we got to talking, I knew there was something about him--he was funny and not afraid to gently poke fun of me.  We agreed to meet at L'As du Fallafel in the Marais, since it was one of the only places guaranteed to be open on a Sunday, and it was one of the most awesome nights of my life.  We talked about everything--our families, our likes, our dislikes, and when we got to our favorite memes it was all over.  We proceeded to drink a little too much at a pub in the Bastille, and he kissed me for the first time right outside the pub on the cobblestone street.  We spent the rest of the night walking across the bridges on the Seine, kissing and talking.  From then on, we were inseparable--I spent nearly every night at his apartment, where he played the keyboard for me and introduced me to Reddit.  We held hands and walked everywhere.  He's taught and shown me so much and challenged my worldview in so many incredible and interesting ways. I realized very quickly that this was something incredibly special, and busted my ass to find a way to stay for the rest of the summer--I was originally supposed to leave the 17th of July.  I found summer classes and a place to stay at the Cité Universitaire dorms, and we told each other that we loved each other right before I left for a weekend trip to Berlin in early July.  I even stayed with his family in the south of France for the last two weeks before I had to go back home to start my last year of university.  I was completely shattered when I had to leave him--I sobbed in front of the security line at the Côte d'Azur airport and I'll never forget the look on his face as he watched me go.  I would've done anything to be able to stay, I had (and still have) absolutely 0 desire to return to the US.

I'm now almost a month into what will probably be a nearly year-long LDR: I finish college in May, and after graduation I plan on returning to Paris to start a master's degree to hopefully be able to teach English (if all goes to plan and I get accepted, of course).  I'm hoping we can see each other in December, but I have 0 savings after studying abroad and am having an incredibly difficult time finding a job.  I realize I've painted a very rosy picture of our relationship--we've certainly had our conflicts, and cultural differences wreaked much more havoc than I ever would've expected, but all in all things are pretty wonderful.

That turned out much longer than I expected, so, my apologies.  I'd love any and all comments/advice/what have you.

TL;DR:  Studied abroad in France, loved it there, met a guy, lovey-dovey bullshit, major paradigm shifts, tearful goodbyes, now am in a LDR and have become one of those annoying people who is bitter about living in the US. Also, am really glad to ""meet"" you all!"

kjgve,5,2011-09-18,Girlfriend returned to her country.  Now acting icy at times.,Hyper_Fujisawa,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kjgve/girlfriend_returned_to_her_country_now_acting_icy/,"I'm 27(m) and my girlfriend(25) of 4 years returned to her native Korea on the 2nd of September.  We had been talking about marriage before she left, so we were very serious about our future together.

**Our Background:** 

We met overseas during study abroad, and after our programs ended we returned to our respective home countries and continued a long distance relationship for 8~9 months.  I was lucky and found employment in Korea as an intern English teacher.  We continued along in Korea until my one year internship expired, at which point we made arrangements to return to the US with her as a student.  We lived together in America for a little over a year and a half.   She ultimately could not afford any more terms at her school here and had to return.  The intern English teacher program in Korea was no longer available so I was forced to remain here.  We had previously planned to return together, but learned too late that the program was gone (which was my only viable option, as I only currently hold an associate's).

**The Problem:** 

Since her return she has been like Dr. Jekyl and Ms. Hyde.  Half the time she's the same adorable girl I fell in love with, the rest... she seems annoyed by me.  I don't think I've been clingy.  In fact, she had been prodding me to contact her more often.
During her bad moods, she wouldn't have much to say on the phone, and asking about her day, or pry other details seemed to annoy her further.
About a week after she got back, she wrote me an email saying that she wanted to break up, but after about six hours she did an about face and was back to normal.
Since that it's been back and forth with her Dr. Jecky and Ms. Hyde.  It's like she's two people, and I never know which one I'm going to get on the line.
Two days ago I told her about a stressful day of mine, and said I could use some cheering up.  She sent me a cheery email saying ""call me call me.""  I called her up and we had connection issues, so I dialed her again.  Even though she had (happily?)asked me to call her, she didn't have much to say and quickly became noticeably annoyed at me.  She said she wanted to hang up, and I said ""okay, I'll call you one more time to say good night before I got to sleep.""  About a minute later I get an email telling me that she doesn't want me to call her one more time before bed, that I'm ""bothering her.""

That was two days ago.  She hasn't replied to my emails, or answered my phone calls.
Today I tried calling her but it didn't even ring and went straight to a recorded message.  I don't understand enough Korean to know what it says.  I *think* it means that her phone is off... but a crazy part of me thinks she might have changed her phone number so I couldn't reach her.

**The Kicker:** She owes my family about $1,500;  Flight to and from the US, and some of her school tuition.  We (my family and I) thought her father with a rather successful business would pay it back quickly.  The economy is bad over there now and she said he couldn't afford to pay now.  Before she had stopped communication it seemed she was going to try and pay off her debt by herself after finding a job.

**My Questions:**

1.  Should I give her some space, or keep trying to contact her?  If I were to not try to contact her, I feel she would think that I don't care about her anymore.  (That's not me being clingy, she thinks that way sometimes.)

2.  What kind of advice can you give me to weather the storm?  If my relationship isn't FUBAR, were looking at at least 6months of LDR before we can see each other again.

3.  If my relationship is fucked, what should I do about the money?

**TL;DR:**  South Korean GF(25) of four years moved back to Korea because of money problems.  She owes my family $1,500.  In the 16 days she's been back she's been Dr. Jekyl and Ms. Hyde.  She seems annoyed by me, even though I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary.  She hasn't contacted me in over two days, despite having a smart phone and a computer at home.  Afraid she changed her phone number.

Just writing this has helped me calm down a little bit, and I appreciate any advice you could give.

Here is my story, I'm a student in graphic design in France, and I have the opportunity to continue my education in the US.

In order to do this I need two cover letters. I have them in French, but they needed to be translated, so I translated them, quickly, I am not familiar with a very proper and formal English, so I did my best.

Here they are.

Dear Sir or Madam,


Bladle did his end of school internship in our company, Company Name, as Assistant Graphic Designer, from June 20th to September 20th 2011. Our edition advice agency is specialised in the creation and realisation of catalogues and art books for the use of auction houses.


During his internship, Bladle got to :
	Work on Adobe Photoshop : outlining (both with the pen and alpha layer), colour uniformisation, and altering.
	Work in Adobe Illustrator : logo creation and updates
	Work on Quark Xpress : layout on 4 catalogues, graphic research for their cover, creation of 7 posters.


Those Works allowed him to make an excellent use of the theoretical knowledge he had, and to master the software he discovered during his education, as well as discovering Quark Xpress.


During the time Bladle was with us, he had been a serious, meticulous, listening, and good spirited intern. He was autonomic enough and knew when to answer the good questions. Moreover, his work was of high quality, and the work he did with the clients will leave a good memory to them,.


I have no doubt that Bladle has all the necessary abilities and motivation to quickly integrate a dynamic team.


Yours faithfully,


And the other one,

Dear Sir or Madam,


I have been Bladle’s teacher all along the school year 2010/2011, at School name, Graphic Design, Multimedia and 3D section.


I taught the print part : Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign ; as well as the web part : HTML, CSS, Flash (with Action Script 3) ; and the 3D/video part : 3D Studio Max with Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro.


Being one of Bladle’s class main teacher, I had plenty of time to evaluate his capacities. I noted constent improvements all year long, only to see him master most of the subjects.


Bladle is a serious student, he gives heed, and is always ready to use what he learned. His passion both for design and computing allow him to learn quickly while enjoying it. He is curious, insterested and always want to learn more.


During the group exercises, Bladle showed great leadership abilities, management and organisation skills, and he brought his team to give high quality Works.


His objective to perfect his education in an American college seems excellent. I believe that such curriculum would be good both professionaly and personally. Moreover, he will bring all his energy and learning thurst to the institution that will have the luck to receive him.


Yours faithfully,


Thanks in advance, and thanks thanks for the wonderful work this community does.
If there are French proofreaders I can show them drafts so they can see what I mean."
kk563,52,2011-09-19,I'm still bitter.,NRussiaAccountThrowU,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/kk563/im_still_bitter/,"I was in mental hospitals through the last few years of high school. I went into this one place. I had a doctor assigned to me. Her name for sake of this story is Dr. Sulz. She had a very calming voice at first but that was the worst. It made me feel comfortable until she used it against me. Everything I said. 

I know you may think I am unstable, or I am insane in this way, but I can assure you I am not. She told me my journal was private, and that it was a place for me to talk to myself. I later found out it was a place for the staff to sit around and mock me, as I got a woman coming up to me asking why I called her a bitch. I was alone more so than I have ever been. 

One day I took a wrapper form a pill I was taking. Klonopin. I wanted to save it as a memento to remind me never to come back here ever. She called me into her room. Holding the wrapper, and asking me why I had it. I told her the honest truth. She called me a liar, and told me to tell her the truth or I could never have visits home. So I told her that I was going to put another pill in it so I could sell it as klonopin. She said because of this behavior I could not go home. A constant trail of betrayals. I didn't go home for thanksgiving, or christmas. It was one of the darkest periods of my life. 

I'm not exaggerating, and I hesitate to tell people because they seldom believe me. There were other things that went on, but I'll keep it short. 

I made my life better by me. I did everything to get better, myself. I am attractive now. I am known for being overly productive at my work place. I have a good future lined up for me, and a good GPA. I have done an internship, and I know 3 other languages. I am a smart, good looking, productive member of society.

Yet I can't help to think of my time in those places every day. Usually for about an hour on and off. I think of this woman. Dr. Sulz. The hatred I had for her manipulating me. The lies she told me. How she said that there was nothing I could do unless she wanted me to do it. My hatred never died down for Dr. Sulz.

I thought of what I would do if I saw her. Mind you this has been playing over and over in my head. What would I do?

Would I tell her I am better? People say living well is the best revenge, but I want her to take no credit for what she thought she may have accomplished. 

Would I tell her I am worse? I could curse at her, I could tell her how much of an awful woman she is. What satisfaction would that give her? Would she think she is better than me for walking away, for not yelling back? Would she think I am still not in a good space?

Would I just say nothing? Would I just stand there. Would I be a deer in the headlights and freeze. Making her feel like she could still intimidate me. 

I never knew what the right thing to do would be. 

I saw her at work today. It was me and another cashier at the counter. I did not have any preparation in my head. I was going on my break. The other cashier was helping someone. I walked over and said ""I'm going on my break now."" She responded ""Sure."" I look up at the customer and it is Dr. Sulz. I had always thought people were being poetic when they talked about minutes seeming like hours. As soon as I had realized I had made eye contact with that woman, Dr. Sulz. I broke it. The shortest eye contact I have had with anyone.

I walked away. More numb than I have ever felt. I know she recognized me, and I only hope she does not think I recognized her. I would not want to give her the satisfaction of thinking she occupies my head for even a fraction of how much I do think about everything.

I drove home, questioning if I should just drive into a phone pole for no reason, so I never have to have this confrontation with anyone again. I'm not suicidal, I would not do that, but the thought certainly seemed nice."

I graduated in June, with a degree in Geography and Earth Science, and a minor in GIS. I've applied to a series of jobs since then with no luck whatsoever.

Part of the problem I feel is discrimination, because I began transitioning from male to female during my senior year. My voice isn't perfect yet and definitely reads male. I'm afraid it's been the reason I've been turned down for at least a few of the jobs that I got to the phone interview stage with. 

 I graduated with honors, and with three semesters of internship experience in GIS under my belt. I thought that with research and computer science experience it'd be easy to find work.

I check GIS Jobs Clearinghouse everyday, but it seems that a lot of jobs demand experience, or a masters. 

If I can't find work within a few weeks, I'm going to be homeless (My parents charge me rent and I'm running out of money). I definitely didn't expect to graduate with thousands of dollars of debt and no job prospects... all the professors told me that the field was so hot that even with a little prejudice I'd be sure to find some work.

I'm a young (read 20) college kid looking to spend the summer in Shanghai for as little money as possible, or even making a little money there. I have been there once before for a few days and loved it so I really want to go back and explore, not to mention that a good friend of mine is from there and talks it up non-stop. I'm looking for suggestions of programs/jobs/etc that can make this possible on the cheap.

I was recently certified as an ESL teacher, so I do have that under my belt, along with some experience. I would love to teach but I don't think the amount of time I'd be able to be there (3 months max) makes it very plausible.

I've also been checking out some internships, but I'm not having much luck finding any in my field (Cognitive Science/Computer Science). They all seem to be  more business oriented.

Any suggestions or pointers appreciated. Thanks!"

couldn't care less (xpost from r/Philadelphia).",orvisdriver,bicycling,https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/kn3ez/driver_hit_and_injured_me_while_biking_to_class/,"A copy of a complaint I wrote to the Philadelphia PD following the incident this morning. I have a ton of respect for cops (and want to work in law enforcement), but this guy was truly an ass to me for no reason.  

I was involved in a bicycle-automobile collision at 16th and Poplar streets at about 9.45am this morning. Prior to the collision, I passed two PPD patrol cars, #934 and #935, stopped facing northbound on 16th at Parrish street, 1 block south of Poplar.  
As I was riding northbound on the right hand side of 16th street, I was struck on my left hand side by a car that suddenly turned right onto Poplar without signaling. When I was struck, I was legally proceeding north through the intersection and had the right-of-way. The car, a black Kia (PA plate # xxxxxx) operated by xxxxxxx stuck me on the left side and caused me to crash into the street, injuring both of my knees and slightly damaging my bike. The vehicle operator stopped and exited his vehicle. A bicyclist behind me (witness xxxxx, information taken by officers) called 911 to report the collision. Approximately 5-10 minutes later, PFD ambulance M-11 arrived and a medic treated the injuries to my knees. It was not until roughly 15 minutes after the initial call that the PPD cars stopped at Parrish (less than 500 feet south and in direct view of the accident) drove up the street to assist me. The first officer to arrive (and the one which I am filing a complaint about) was P/O Lewis, badge #2930 in car #934. He took both of our information and discussed what had happened. Shortly after he arrived, P/O Davis, badge #5330 drove the 500 feet up the street in car #935. P/O Lewis issued a ticket to the motorist for failure to provide insurance information, which is obviously unrelated to the collision.  
My specific complaint is that A) P/O Lewis refused to issue a citation to the motorist as a result of the incident, and B) that he was rude to me and ultimately left the scene without resolving the issue.  
Both myself and witness xxxxx noted that the black Kia did not have its turn signals on when it initiated the turn and collided with me. As per PA Title 75 §3334(b), a vehicle MUST signal their intended movement, either by turn signal or by hand, within 100 feet of the turn. Both myself and the bicyclist who was directly behind me can confirm the fact that this was clearly not done by the motorist. When I told P/O Lewis that Mr. xxxxx broke the law by not signaling his turn (thereby resulting in my crash and injury), he dismissed it and became rude when I insisted that this was the case. He repeated to me over and over again that 'I didn't see it' when I asked as to whether the motorist would be cited for failure to signal, reckless driving, or some other violation. He informed me that if he were to ticket the driver, he would ticket me as well; he gave no basis for this statement, and then decided that he quote 'won't even give you (sic) that pleasure' (presumably of giving me a ticket for lawfully riding in my right-of-way).  
Whether or not P/O Lewis saw the collision (which indeed happened in plain view of himself and P/O Davis) is immaterial as to the actual violation that occurred. For example, if a motorist runs a red light and crashes into a lawfully driven vehicle, will the offending driver not face a citation for breaking the law if an officer 'didn't see it'? This explanation is obviously insufficient, and he made absolutely no attempt to find out whether or not Mr. xxxxxx violated the law by not signaling within 100 feet of his turn, and asked 'what's wrong with you (sic)?' and also laughed at me when I reiterated that Mr. xxxxx injured me by breaking the law.  
He again ignored me when I asked if there were other options for having the driver cited or made liable in any other way for injuring me. As a former intern for the DA's Office, I am aware that one can file private criminal complaints somehow; however P/O Lewis again ignored me when I asked about this option. I also asked if I could have a copy of the 75-48 incident report, and he refused, saying 'I ain't gonna help you (sic) out' and instead gave me a DCN number on a scrap of paper. He then ignored the other questions that I had, and instead told me that he didn't like me and walked to his patrol car and left.  
I feel that the attitude and response of these officers, particularly P/O Lewis was utterly ridiculous, and that both P/O Lewis and P/O Davis failed to even attempt to enforce the traffic law. Furthermore, it is absolutely ridiculous that I was treated with such negativity and rudeness as a victim of an ignorant driver."

kmyul,8,2011-09-21,Depression at work,binary_despression,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kmyul/depression_at_work/,"I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for about 10 years now. I first went to a few therapists in the beginning. They all told me the same thing- you need to be on medicine, off to the psychiatrist. I have had mixed success with various meds over the years but recently I seem to have a good combination going.

My home life is absolutely awesome. I have a wonderful wife I absolutely love, two great dogs, great family, nice house, my dream car and no financial problems. I absolutely hate feeling depressed knowing how good I have it compared to some other people.

Work. This is where it breaks down for me and the medication becomes nearly useless. I love what I do, I am a programmer and I think I am pretty damn good at it (at least until it comes to considering finding a new job). I feel absolutely trapped and bored at work. I randomly start crying, I have gotten in trouble with HR for being ""overly to the point"" with people and now one more silly comment and I won't have a job and I feel like most people dislike me now.

Due to the crying and anxiety I used the ADA to request reasonable accommodations. I wanted to work from home, but instead they put me in an office. This is rare as we have this standard huge, open, noisy areas with groups of half cubes everyone sits in. I have gotten comments about me having an office but I try to brush it off. As a 5 year mid-senior level developer I ""shouldn't"" have an office. The office is great otherwise, I get tons more work done without the noise, distractions, and other people around making me nervous.

As soon as I walk in in the morning it is like this black cloud appears and the dread starts. Why? I know I am bored and feel trapped. Nothing about this job is challenging anymore. We do nothing cutting edge (bank / loan software) so there is really no opportunity outside of my coding at home to learn much or work with anything interesting. The corporate culture is very reactive. I am passionate about my work, the way bugs, customer issues and new features are handled I wonder why we have clients, and that disgusts me. Hell, it makes me feel dirty in a way.

I want to go hand my boss my letter of resignation but I can't bring myself to do it. I didn't finish college. I started out as a developer intern and worked my way up. I feel like not finishing college was a mistake and now my chances at employment outside of this hell are slim. Also my physical location- no programming jobs and telecommute jobs are hard to come by. I'm also worried I will just fall back into the same trap. I just can't be around so many people in the open floor ""hive"" concept.

At work, or at home after a particular nasty day, I can't shake the trapped feeling. While I would never do it, the idea of the sweet escape of death just sticks in the back of my head like this cathartic release just waiting for me. I hate thinking that. I hate living like this. I am afraid it will eventually start wearing on my wife.

I have my resignation ready to go. The only problem is I don't have enough saved to survive long without a job lined up. I also feel like quitting is the only way I will be forced to settle on another employer. I'm to the point where I would prefer living in a card board box (with an internet connection and electricity for my computer) to staying, but I can't put my wife through that.

I don't know if I need advice, or just needed to get this off of my chest, but being able to post this here is already helping. I apologize that this feels so ""first world problem"", it definitely makes me feel silly.

TLDR: Depressed, hate job, some suicidal ideation I won't act out on, feel trapped at job."

I just really don't think I can survive in the typical office life for the next 35 years. 

Don't get me wrong, these jobs pay well. Really well, but my goal for my career is not to make a ton of money, but to not hate my job. My dad hates his job (but making bank) and I grew up thinking I really don't want to be that. So my idea right now is try something exciting. Join the army. I don't believe for half a second I'll be some guy on the field with some crazy awesome rifle doing all the badass stuff I see on TV. I've read about it and think I have a realistic perspective of the army and fully expect to join as a commissioned engineer working in my field, but I'm sure it would be more interesting and dynamic than a industry job. 

The few friends I've mentioned this to think I'm crazy. No one here joins the army. My career adviser laughed at me. I've never mentioned this idea to my parents.. I need some real advice. Not the advice from people with a skewed perspective of the world who think everyone in the army dies in 5 minutes. That's you reddit. Help me! Should I do it?


TL;DR: Graduating soon as a computer engineer, could get a high paying job that's super lame. Should I join the army?"

So, my question for you guys is, do you work at a company that does anything IT related, do you know anyone who does or are you able to help me finding an internship in another way? I'll send anything Kenyan or African (if you'd like) to the person that helps me find the job. :D
I'm also interested in Video production/Graphic Design/Video Editing though I'm not so knowledgeable in this field. In the long run I'm looking forward to living/working in Sweden so I’m willing to take any interesting internship opportunities there.
I also do not mind community work etc Thanks!!!!
I'd be happy to join a firm, take the first few weeks to learn just with basic salary to cater for expenses, once skilled we get to a contract with the company. Cheers!

Brief Overview:
Talent booking agency seeks hardworking, organized junior logistics manager. Primary responsibilities will include booking flights, trains, hotels, driver service and meals for DJs and their tour managers while on tour. This position reports directly to the Senior Logistics Manager. Busy Georgetown office provides a rewarding place to work with opportunities to attend local electronic music events.  Applicants must have outstanding organizational and communication skills and a flexible, positive attitude. Experience booking travel is strongly preferred.


Key roles/activities:
-- This role involves interacting with 4 groups of critical individuals in our business:  DJs, travel agents (contracted through our preferred agency, McNair Travel), event/club promoters, and agents at Bullitt.  For each group, there are a set of complementary responsibilities and expected impact:
  
(1) Interactions with DJ:
    - Prepare full itineraries for tours, including all travel (hotel, airline, car service, meals)
    - Be on call to answer questions or accommodate last-minute travel changes, as they arise (particularly if the tour manager or agent are unavailable)

(2) Interactions with Travel Agent:
    - Coordinate flights with travel agent
    - Be responsible for key travel items as they arise (i.e., upgrades, DJ travel preferences) with travel agent

(3) Interactions with Club/Event Promoter:
    - Serve as primary contact for logistical coordination with promoter, including supplying and discussing travel information, answering questions, serving as “buffer” between agent and promoter
    on logistical issues, as appropriate
    - Serve as liaison to coordinate and approve collateral materials and equipment set-up related to the event/club (fliers, artwork, tech requirements)
    - Manage guest lists— including handling requests and compiling final lists to share with promoter

(4) Interactions with Bullitt Agents:
    - Be single point of contact for all travel-related questions for agent
    - At weekly team meetings, provide an update on all travel/logistics for the team (i.e., keep agents in loop of status of each gig)
    - Help team as necessary on special events (cd release parties, business conferences, etc..)

-- Additional overall duties include:
    - Daily communications with above groups
    - Preparing for weekly team meetings and individual check-in sessions
    - Light office administrative duties (e.g., answering phones throughout the day, helping with team organization)
    - Training interns that may help with workload

Impact will be measured in a few key ways:
   - Feedback from DJs and promoters, through semi-annual reviews and post-gig feedback processes
    - Percent of events that have minimal travel/logistic issues
    - Participation and contribution at weekly team meetings

Skills/competencies required for this role:
•	Client service orientation:  strong interpersonal skills, ability to communicate effectively with others, flexibility in handling difficult situations and resolving them in a service-oriented fashion 
•	Team leadership:  ability to work on a team (“team player”), excited to learn from others (e.g., take feedback, seek personal development opportunities), ability to contribute to the team (even on issues not directly related to scope of work), willing to be mentored and serve as a mentor to others on the team 
•	Process management and problem-solving: can raise concerns and ask for help from the team in a timely manner, is a strong problem solver (can identify an issue, think through options, and make a recommendation on best path forward) 
•	Communications:  Has strong verbal and written communications (i.e., can communicate effectively via email)
•	Superior organizational skills: ability to “stay ahead of the problem” by proactively planning ahead, ability to develop and manage own work plan (outline what needs to be done, activities required to complete a task timeline to complete the task)

kp29l,0,2011-09-23,"I wrote an open letter to Elizabeth Warren regarding her ""famous"" internet quote. ",[deleted],republicans,https://www.reddit.com/r/republicans/comments/kp29l/i_wrote_an_open_letter_to_elizabeth_warren/,"Dear Elizabeth Warren,

It has come to my attention that you’ve made a statement which has given you a lot of internet recognition on a number of social networking sites. I congratulate you on your fifteen minutes of fame which will probably be cut short by another obscure person’s witty quote. Before you join the ranks of other internet memes such as Rebecca Black and the “Y U No…” guy please allow me to reply to your call for me to “pay it forward”. 

First off, I went to public school from kindergarten through high school. I graduated with 1200 other people that all received the same education. My parents did not have money for college and I knew that if I wanted a college education I would have to fund it myself. I chose to spend my high school nights studying with the hope that my grades would lead to a college scholarship. I had friends, but we weren’t the cool kids that went out every weekend and prioritize other activities before our education. I graduated close to the top of my class and as a result of my hard work I received a full ride to a state college. Some of the “cool” kids that I mentioned earlier were also from meager backgrounds but their grades were not impressive enough to earn them any type of assistance for college. Some went to community college and others decided to take factory jobs. 

In college I had to maintain a very high grade point average to retain my scholarship. This meant many hours in the library and even the occasional sleepless night. Since my room and board was not covered I also had to maintain a part time job so that I could pay my rent and eat. My friends were limited to my study partners and my romantic life was virtually non existent. I never had the time to attend house parties, go on spring break trips, or attend homecoming football games.

Toward the end of my college education I managed to secure a few internships with some successful companies. Through the impressions that I made at these companies I had no problem finding a job long before I graduated. The work ethic that I had instilled in myself in high school and college carried over and as a result I quickly progressed up the corporate ladder. After a few years I took advantage of my company’s tuition reimbursement plan and went to school at night to get my MBA. 

While in graduate school I met other successful professionals and a few of us eventually decided to quit our jobs and start our own company. Lucky for us the gamble paid off and within five years I was able to buy out my partners. 

Today I provide stable employment for over 1000 people at my factory and solicit the services of multiple other companies, all which employ American citizens. I pay the county, state, and federal taxes which are required of me and assume that those monies go toward upkeep of the surrounding infrastructure, schools, police department, fire department, and US armed forces. In addition, my company donates money and volunteer efforts to the local community as a way of improving the quality of life of our neighbors. 

I suppose I should reemphasize the fact that my company is based in the US and is employing US workers. Maybe you’ve forgotten about the number of companies packing up and moving oversees or to Mexico where they can produce the same products at a fraction of the price. Even the “Big 3” which were supposed to be the last glimmer of hope for the American Dream are more reliant on goods produced overseas then they are on domestic made products. Where are the proposals and cute internet quotes proposing higher taxes and tariffs on them? Last I checked the shelves of the local Wal-Mart were fully stocked with goods made anywhere but the United States. 

I got to where I am today through my own hard work and ingenuity. I understand that there are some CEOs out there that had it slightly easier than I, but they would not still be where they are without a strong work ethic and the knowledge that success is earned. I never received anything I didn’t work for and I find it insulting that you are trying to exploit my hard work for the benefit of those that have different priorities. 

Rather than jumping on the Washington DC bandwagon and blindly calling for more jobs and higher taxes, ask yourself “Where did the jobs and extra tax revenue go?” Penalize the companies that choose to bypass the American worker while trying to sell to his neighbor.  These are your crooks and your criminals. These are the people that exploited the system to increase their profit margin. Why aren’t they being asked to “pay it forward”? 

Regards

CEO of American Company

יא כִּי הַמִּצְוָה הַזֹּאת, אֲשֶׁר אָנֹכִי מְצַוְּךָ הַיּוֹם--לֹא-נִפְלֵאת הִוא מִמְּךָ, וְלֹא רְחֹקָה הִוא.  יב לֹא בַשָּׁמַיִם, הִוא:  לֵאמֹר, מִי יַעֲלֶה-לָּנוּ הַשָּׁמַיְמָה וְיִקָּחֶהָ לָּנוּ, וְיַשְׁמִעֵנוּ אֹתָהּ, וְנַעֲשֶׂנָּה.  יג וְלֹא-מֵעֵבֶר לַיָּם, הִוא:  לֵאמֹר, מִי יַעֲבָר-לָנוּ אֶל-עֵבֶר הַיָּם וְיִקָּחֶהָ לָּנוּ, וְיַשְׁמִעֵנוּ אֹתָהּ, וְנַעֲשֶׂנָּה.  יד כִּי-קָרוֹב אֵלֶיךָ הַדָּבָר, מְאֹד:  בְּפִיךָ וּבִלְבָבְךָ, לַעֲשֹׂתוֹ.

Chapter 30: 11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off. 12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say: 'Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?' 13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say: 'Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?' 14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.  (Translation from mechon mamre)

This little section follows a section about repentance and redemption, and is followed by a section imploring the Jews to choose life over sin and death.  Right before the new year, Rosh Hashana, we see a section telling us that the Torah is easily accessible, if only we follow our mouth and heart.

The parsha this week is telling us, no matter what situation we are in, do not give up.  If  you are having trouble with faith, money, or my new internship (I hate my boss), the Torah and all of its valuable wisdom is right there, within reach.  If we have strayed, you can repent, the torah is not over the sea, it is not in the sky, but on Earth, with us.  We should choose life this coming new year, choose the path that God has set for us.  

The Torah in 30:1 does not say if you will sin but ""it will be that when all these things come to you....""  God knows we are not perfect, and is ok with our frailties and mistakes.  We all have the option to repent, to do teshuva.  

Interesting enough, in order to be near to God and the Torah, we are told to use our mouth and hearts.  I found it a bit strange.  Just my thoughts on it, it is rather what the mouth and heart do, as opposed to other things like sight and hearing.  Seeing, hearing and even feeling to a certain degree are things that we passively do.  If a car shoots by, you can not help but hear and see it.

But speaking is something we can control.  We can ponder our feelings and understand them in the deepest sense.  When doing repentance, or just being a Jew, or an ordinary person, we have to be active in our lives.  We have to make the move to do teshuva, we have to make the move to stop waking up late and missing minyan (cough cough, stupid internship).  We are in control of all that we do, for better or for worse.  So please, take this message with you for Shabbos and Rosh Hashanah.

Have a good Shabbos r/Judaism!

* Graduating in December 2012 (about 15 months)
* Have student loans for my tuition, parents have offered to pay off the interest, I am responsible for the rest.
* Earn about $200 a month at my part time job after taking out monthly expenses.
* Fairly frugal spender.. total ""free time"" expenses per month ~$40
* Two accounts through my dad's employer's credit union: **Savings: ~$3,000 Checking: $1,600**
* Use checking account for all purchases and depositing income.

Basically, what can I do to prepare financially for after graduation? I'm hoping to have a job immediately as I'm in a good field will hopefully have an internship this spring or summer to build my resume. But I realize I also need to be prepared if I don't.

I've looked at CDs but the rates aren't appealing at all. Is there anything I can do at all besides just banking whatever money I can until then?"
kqcno,2,2011-09-24,"4 year relationship - we grew up together. There are problems though. [Long, but I really appreciate any help]",throw30303,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kqcno/4_year_relationship_we_grew_up_together_there_are/,"Hey guys, 

I'm doing a throwaway and my goals in this are to be totally honest. I'm sorry if I sound like a jerk or if it gets long -- I also want to be succinct -- but I want to just tell it straight.

Anyway, my GF and I are both 21, we started dating senior year of HS. We also ended up at the same college, which genuinely wasn't intentional (but we also didn't fight it). So you've got 2 of the usual issues: we started in HS, and we dating thru college. Except for one mistake night (not sex) about 3 years ago, we've never hooked up w/ anyone else. We lost our vcards to each other.

To get to the point, I'm thinking about ending it. I can cite a few reasons: we've drifted apart, hobbies and interests-wise; I'm feeling intense pressure to 'sow my wild oats' because I've never been with anyone else and because I'm not getting any younger; and (and this is the part I'm not proud of) I don't find super-attractive anymore. She's never been very active, but watches upwards of 5-6hr of TV per night, and doesn't have a job or internship. She has probably gained 30-40lbs since HS. I have probably gained around 10-15 but I go to the gym frequently and bike commute, so I'm losing weight.  She's probably gone to the gym 3 times in the time I've known her - I don't see that changing, frankly, so long-term that's seriously a concern, regardless of how shallow I might be. I have a full-time job (self-employed) and she's unemployed/a student, so tries to get me to work less, etc, and it's probably not helping my performance at work, although I am of course able to control that and I'm my own boss.

I also am not being totally emotionally faithful. I was at a bar with some friends and a girl started dancing on me and I didn't stop her. The truth was I kept going because my GF won't go to clubs like that, and I always try to get her to go. She doesn't want to go because she is uncomfortable about her body, she doesn't like ""club"" clothes, and she hates electronic music, which is something I'm really passionate about.  I find myself noticing lots and lots of attractive girls around town, and...this is inexcusable, I'm a fucking douche...probably 25% of the time I feel self-concious having her with me because I feel she's less attractive than the other girls around me. I don't flirt with them or talk to them, but that's probably irrelevant.

In the past, if I'd finally gathered the balls to go to RA, I'd've talked about how she didn't have any friends, how that was a concern, but that's gotten better. But the kicker here is that we have a very troubled sex life. From about 2 years ago to 6 months ago, we had sex a total of something like 4 or 5 times. About 6 months ago it got slightly more frequent, about once every 3 weeks. We tried again about 3 weeks ago, and it was extremely painful for her, perhaps because she doesn't 'use her bits very often' or because she doesn't like that kind of condom (her thoughts). So, as I was saying about the attractiveness thing, my hypothesis is that I had to shut down my attractiveness to her to be able to deal with the no-sex thing. I'd sleep in bed next to her night after night and I think it just numbed me.

Now I can read any number of threads where guys are bitching about not having as much sex as they'd like to (and they're doing it like 5 times a week), so I feel like an absolute idiot in that department. But remember: I've never known anyone as long as I have her in my life. She's somewhat financially dependent on me and we both know she will be much more broken up about it if we break up -- to compensate for our lack of sex, I've honestly grown rather emotionally numb about it. Which has kind of helped keep me in it, because she's fun to be around.

Anyway, any thoughts? So sorry about the length."

Just got a small apartment (Or, two small rooms, whatever) on my own and a pretty sweet internship. So far I've already noticed a small loss just from walking to work and home again, and in to the city a few nights (probably just 2-4 kilometers to my job). It might not be much, but it's atleast a huge difference compared to taking the bus directly from my house to school.

But now that I'm living on my own, I'm also having to deal with buying and making food for my self, so far it's been pretty good and I've made dinners that aren't too shabby, but surely not optimal either. The problem on my part is that a frozen pizza and other easy meals are usually far cheaper (atleast it seems so in the store) and alot faster to make, so I'm afraid I'll be tempted to go with that in the long run.

I'm a big fan of chicken and could see myself eating that alot if it's cheap and easy to make. Also a huge fan of pasta, but not sure how good that is (with carbs and all that, I don't know).

Uhm, yeah. Sorry for a pretty bad and log post, not really comfortable talking about stuff like this.

tl;dr - I'm poor and looking for some healthier diet that's not hard to make."

i started the program sometime in mid july and ran whenever i felt like running. so sometimes i would run everyday and other times i would take several days off - just whatever i felt like. i was on track to finish several weeks early but took a break for like 2 weeks in between week 8 and 9 while i finished my summer internship, went on vacation, and moved back to university. moving from my hometown to my college town proved to be such a major improvement in my pace and how winded i would be at the end. on thursday (my penultimate day) i successfully completed a 5k in the 30 minute time period and i repeated the feat today. 

i may have to sign up for a local 5k just to prove i can do it without the program too.

for those who are thinking about starting, do it! and for those who are currently doing it, keep it up! the hardest days for me were definitely the first day and week 5 day 3. i couldn't believe how much easier it was than i thought it would be.

feel free to ask any questions if you have them. thanks for all your help loseit!"

ks2pi,2,2011-09-26,"What to tell your congressperson, member of parliament or other democratic representative.",[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/ks2pi/what_to_tell_your_congressperson_member_of/,"First of all, if you've ever signed a petition regarding decriminalisation, legalisation or ending the war on drugs, why not take it a step further?  
Write to whoever represents you in government, and even if it only gets seen by an intern or secretary, the sheer volume of mail, were we all to do it, would show them that a lot of people care about the subject.

But don't just repeat the same old arguments about the benefits of legalisation: I'm sure they've heard them all before. Also, I'm sure that there are many people in government who are personally pro-legalisation, but would never admit that. So, when you write, do this:

**Dare** them to make a change.

It seems to me that as soon as one major western country makes the move towards decriminalisation or legalisation, the others will follow suit, or certainly give it proper consideration. So, dare your representative to be the first person to bring about that change. Dare them to stand up against the anti-drug masses. Dare them to speak out against the dogma.

If each and every one of us did this, perhaps just one politician will read and take to heart what we have to say. But that's all we need: one politician daring enough to make a change."
krfus,5,2011-09-25,"I pack up and pull a disappearing act when things become too much, and the opportunity to do so has popped up again. (24/F)",furbyhooker,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/krfus/i_pack_up_and_pull_a_disappearing_act_when_things/,"I'm a whole bundle of issues, but this is the one I take most issue with, and the one I feel affects people around me more than I'd like to admit. I've done this 3-4 times in the past 5 years when it feels like I can't handle anymore bullshit going on in my life, relationships, etc. 

5 years ago, I left my home town after a fight with an ex that ended in physical violence from his end. I bought a plane ticket, packed my shit up, didn't tell anyone what I was doing, and was gone. I hated where I lived, I hated my ex because he was abusive, and it felt like I was going no where with my life. So, I disappeared. I did not talk to anyone for a long time from my home town. 

When I got to my new city (Austin), in a state 2000 miles away, I felt a sense of relief. I was starting over, I didn't know anybody, and I felt it was an opportunity to do something different and to better myself. Of course, I met people, got engaged, and I quickly found myself feeling like my life was becoming too settled, and not the way I had planned. Another feeling I've always had when this urge to flee arrives is the feeling that I know too many people, and too many people know me. It's like I'm too 'connected,' and in a way, it makes me feel very anxious and scared. My fiance at the time actually convinced me to move with him to Ohio for work, and I thought of it as a chance to once again run away and start over, to see if I could experience something different.

About 6 months into the move, it became obvious things weren't working out. My fiance and I called off our wedding, and I packed up my shit and took off back to a town close to Austin. This time felt a little different. While I was moving *back* to a familiar area, I kept myself secluded, did not talk to the friends I made in Austin before moving to Ohio, and I felt far enough from town that I could be a stranger again. 

This past year has been really difficult; I went through a bad breakup, a grandparent I was very close to passed away, and I have been very sick, with symptoms getting progressively worse recently. It feels like I know too many people in the same circles, and that I am no longer able to be private or alone because of this. All of these things have made me consider running again and pulling what my family refers to as the disappearing act. I am getting the urge to pack up and cut off contact with everyone again. 

This weekend, I spoke with one of my professors; he talked to me about studying abroad for an internship beginning in December. I haven't told anyone about this, and I wouldn't. I would just leave. The return date was flexible, and I don't have much longer until I graduate. If I took the internship, I would make every attempt to make it last long enough to make valuable connections and to network to find a job upon graduating, so I don't have to return. I want to jump on it, but I know I want to leave for all the wrong reasons. I want to leave to escape, and to run away, because it's the only way I know how to cope with things when they feel too overwhelming. And I know this can't keep going on. I can't keep jumping and disappearing; I don't want to keep doing this, either. 

If anyone has any advice, it'd be much appreciated. Here are some other fun facts about me if it helps you in your response: I'm currently seeing a psychiatrist for a number of reasons, mostly for depression and compulsive habits that have developed this year and have really fucked up my life and relationships. I'm going to see a neurologist this week for testing as I've had symptoms that are causing concern and trips to the ER (slurred speech, memory loss, confusion, tremor in my right hand, etc). If you want to know anything else feel free to ask.

**TL;DR** I run away whenever things become too much in my life and start over new somewhere else. This is becoming a bad habit of mine and I want it to stop. I have the opportunity to 'jump ship' again thanks to an internship, but don't want to take it as I know it's for the wrong reasons. Need advice on how to deal with the urge to flee when things become too much."

[Demons](http://www.amazon.com/Demons-Special-Lamberto-Bava/dp/B000T28POC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317134319&amp;sr=8-1) - directed by Mario Bava's son and co-written with Dario Argento, this is a well-known splatter-classic from the '80s. I haven't watched it yet since I'm saving it for next month (shameless plug - come to [/r/horrormoviechallenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/horrormoviechallenge/) and challenge yourself to watch as many horror movies as possible next month!) but I'm really excited to see it!

[Hell of the Living Dead](http://www.amazon.com/Hell-Living-Margit-Evelyn-Newton/dp/B00005R24H/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317134508&amp;sr=1-2) - Wish I had found the Blue Underground version of this one instead, but I doubt that there is a significant difference between the two editions. That said, this is well known for being one of the worst zombie movies ever - it's chock full of stock footage, and the director even shamelessly lifted the score from Romero's Dawn of the Dead for the movie. This is definitely going to be bad in a bad way.

[C.H.U.D.](http://www.amazon.com/C-H-U-D-John-Heard/dp/B00004Y6BC/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317134711&amp;sr=1-1) - Did you like Home Alone, but wish there were more cannibals in it? This might be for you - Daniel Stern and John Heard also star in this '80s flick (which stands for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers) which should be great fun - probably double feature it with Hell of the Living Dead for a nice drive-in/grindhouse effect.

[The Bela Lugosi Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Lugosi-Collection-Murders-Morgue-Invisible/dp/B0009X770E/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317134890&amp;sr=1-1) - Movies included: Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Black Cat, The Raven, The Invisible Ray and Black Friday. This is almost more properly a Karloff/Lugosi collection, since Karloff is also in 4 of the 5 films. I'm really looking forward to watching all of these - word of warning if you are interested, though: Like the Universal Legacy Collection DVDs, there was a problem with the DVD encoding on this release which causes glitches in the movie. I'm hoping this wasn't why I found it for $10 at a used DVD store, but I won't know until I sit down and try and fast-forward through them all (sure way to catch the glitch - the movie will freeze if it's a bad disc).

[The Bava Collection, Vol. 2](http://www.amazon.com/Bava-Box-Set-Vol/dp/B000UVV23S/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317135186&amp;sr=1-1) - Movies included: Baron Blood, Lisa and the Devil, House of Exorcism, Roy Colt and Winchester Jack, Four Times That Night, Five Dolls for an August Moon, Kidnapped and Bay of Blood. Awesome box set from, so far, my favorite horror director (I still have a lot of movies to go, but I've loved every one of them so far). This collection kind of runs the gamut, from horror to comedy-western to erotic comedy to crime thriller, so there's plenty of variety. Fun trivia - two of the murder scenes in Friday the 13th Part II are nearly shot for shot reproductions of murders in the movie Bay of Blood.

[Girls, Guns and G-Strings - The Andy Sidaris Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Girls-Guns-G-Strings-Dona-Speir/dp/B004HHX9OQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317135526&amp;sr=1-1) - Too many movies to list, but that's OK - these are a special kind of movie. You know the kind of movie that would air at 1:00 AM on Showtime or Cinemax in the mid to late '90s? These are it - 12 movies that feature ludicrous storylines, explosions and Playboy models-turned-actresses. Hard Ticket to Hawaii is the best one I have watched so far - watch [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd_X-C5g29o) (probably not NSFW, but I don't know where you work so it may be best watched elsewhere) and tell me this movie isn't worth watching.

[Treasure of the Sierra Madre](http://www.amazon.com/Treasure-Sierra-Madre-Two-Disc-Special/dp/B00003CXD5/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317135986&amp;sr=1-2) - Now for the only recent non-horror or cheese purchase. Starring Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston, this is a great adventure movie about the search for gold in Mexico and how it amplifies or changes the character of those pursuing it. Can't recommend this one enough.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading - I think this might be the longest piece I have ever typed on the internet!"

Well, im a php junior by your standard, so im looking for things i may have missed in my first try. 

There is this php project that is for storing data about indicidents regarding Quality Assurement in a Multinational enterprise. 

it was made by 3 different interns, everyone of them write a separate side project, with a separate database, template, set of rules, ideas, everything you can name they did different from each other.

The first one, the users upload/download word files.. and you get lost in version control with this.. its a nightmare for the users (so they tell me) 

The second one, does use a database for store its information, but has this giagantic forms of 60 textboxs that users are afraid of, and refuse to use...

the third one, its like the second but its unfinished... 

I havent seen the code yet, but im pretty sure it would be the same quality as any copy/paste the original programers find in google.

Obviously I need to see the code to know how much i can do, but without it i see several things i can make

1. Unify every sideproject into only one
1.  Put a login system, this thing has NO security
1.  Add a regular automatic backup 
1.  Start monitoring things, logging them 
1.  Make a propper database 
1.  Rewrite probably everything, slowly 


What am i missing?

What should be the orden i do this things?

ksiax,5,2011-09-26,Friends aren't suppose to treat you like a doormat.,LZcurlygirl,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ksiax/friends_arent_suppose_to_treat_you_like_a_doormat/,"One year ago my friend and I went to a dance teacher convention together. While there, she was so mean to me. This sounds stupid but I don't know how else to say it. She bossed me around when it came to the sightseeing we did, she gave me a hard time about the hotel I found for us  and when we met up with another friend back there for the remaining three days she degraded me in front of her. 

I had no idea what was going on. At first, I decided that I would just try to give her some space by trying to go and eat meals by myself but she wouldn't let me by saying that I was being rude to our other friend and that we don't have a lot of time to spend with her. During meals she wouldn't talk to me and roll her eyes when I tried to make conversation. After the seminars for the day were over I would go walk about NYC by myself so I wouldn't have to be in a room with her. After coming back from one of my walks the key to the room didn't work so I knocked...and knocked. I went down to the front desk and couldn't get a new key bc her name was on room. Ends up, I waited in the hallway for 30 minutes until she finally answered the door, annoyed that my key didn't work. The next morning she refused to help me get a  new key. 

At that point I finally asked her what was wrong and why she was acting like this. She turned her back on me and walked away. I was blown away. How could someone I considered a good friend turn their back on me and refuse to talk to me about why they are so irritated. I would have accepted, ""Hormones are raging because I'm pregnant and everything is bothering me."" or ""you're stupid, I don't like you anymore."". But turning your back and completely ignoring the situation helps no one.

A couple weeks after we've been home she calls and asks if I want to teach for her in her studio. I told her I would like to talk to her about it. She doesn't return my call. I ask if she can come over so we can talk and she shows up with a student of hers. I don't find it to be appropriate to talk about it in front of someone else. I end up calling her and telling her I do not want to teach for her assuming she would ask WHY. In that answer I was going to let her know how she treated me in NY was cruel and a friend would never treat another friend like that so there was no way I was going to be her employee. Well, she didn't ask why, she just said ""fine"". 

Since that conversation I've kept her at arm's length. I stopped calling her and stopped ""hanging out"". I used the excuse that school and my internship kept me busy. I met her for coffee 4 months later which was fine, except for her negativity about life in general. I didn't care for her bad energy and still kept her at a distance. 

Fast forward to today and I get a text asking if everything is ok and how have I been. REALLY!? I guess I should know  that subtle hints don't do what you want them to. I called back in hopes of just telling her why I haven't been around and of course, she acts like we talked yesterday.

I am frustrated for two reasons. One, because I don't have the balls to just tell her that she was absolutely horrible and I don't need people like that in my life. And two, because she doesn't realize or is avoiding it. Has anybody else been in a situation like this? Any tact advice would be helpful. Thanks for listening."

AMA,gx1400,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ku7o8/iama_23_yr_old_with_severe_obstructive_sleep/,"Since my teens I was always absolutely exhausted during the morning, but would be fine by mid morning.  I've always been a night owl but life sucks with you can't do mornings.

In college, I dated a girl who was a pre-med major and not long after she started sleeping over she freaked out and said she thought I was going to die in my sleep.  She urged me to get checked for sleep apnea.  It took about 2 years to convince my parents it was a major issue and I needed to get diagnosed, I could schedule later classes but I couldn't come in late for internships.

I was diagnosed at 21 with OSA.  At first my ENT suggested we look into removing my tonsils, but after my sleep study showed an Apnea-Hypopnea Index of 74 (30+ is considered Severe according to my doc); she said surgery would be painful and a method to alleviate the symptoms but not solve anything.

I've been using a CPAP for 2+ years and it's changed my life.  If anyone has any questions or concerns, I hope a young person's perspective may help you out.  AMA

tl;dr: 23 yr old with sleep apnea.  life sucked, now better.  Hope to help someone else with concerns."

I have some basic experience with Unity (went through a book I purchased and the tutorials + made some simple games) and looking for some partners to work asynchronously with on a project (preferably very small).

Pretty much just though it would be neat to find some people I might get a long with to work on a project. I don't have any game ideas in mind, but I'd like to just implement a bunch of core gameplay ideas and expand on any if necessary.

Ideal partners would be another programmer (who has a little bit of artistic skill) who has similar/more experience.

I'm also open to working with UDK.

I wasn't sure if this was the right subreddit to post an add like this. If there are better please advise and I'll repost.

Thanks

The ferry wouldn't accept card and we had no cash, so he bought us tickets. I know he's originally from the West of Germany but now lives with 2 other people in Berlin. He's getting his masters in Electrical Engineering and is returning to Germany on Thursday after spending 4 months in Trinidad on a MAN internship. After the internship, he traveled around Brazil and we caught up with him essentially on his way home (Ihla Grande -&gt; Sao Paulo -&gt; Germany), but we lost him in between the bus station and Metro station in Sao Paulo. He was awesome and we talked for some time on the bus ride from Angra Dos Reis to Sao Paulo. He's a gymnast and plans to build a computer as soon as he returns to Berlin. Do you know him?

ktlv7,3,2011-09-27,IAma 20 year old engineering student who went to jail and almost went to prison for an LSD trip,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ktlv7/iama_20_year_old_engineering_student_who_went_to/,"    This happened about a year ago at my university at NCSU. 
At the time I was doing very well in school an was active in my fraternity life. One 
Thursday night I decided to trip LSD with some of my brothers very late at night. 
It started with watching The Yellow Submarine
in my room and ended up in county jail with 1 felony account of grand theft auto, 2 
felony accounts of attempted larceny, a felony assault on a LEO, and a DWI (also a 
crashed stolen car in a ditch and a wounded police officer). All occurring within the 
hours of 6:30am and 9:00am.What ensued afterward was an intense year of rehab, 
sober living, community service and hoping for the best. And thanks to a VERY expensive
lawyer, hard work, and generous parents I was able to make it out without doing 
any time. This event still is the main driving factor in my life, and there is still much to do
to rectify this incident. Deep down I'm just a nerdy engineering student. I figured 
my story was worthy enough to be posted; and feel free to ask any questions about 
the incident and wtf is going on now.

Here is a link to the news page where I was featured that day:

http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/10/24/758760/teen-arrested-for-vehicle-theft.html

Thanks for reading. It's been one hell of a trip. I'll be enrolled back in NCSU next Spring.

EDIT:
Just to add some more clarity to the situation, I figured I should elaborate on the circumstances of this incident.
I had experimented with many other forms of psychedelics before this night. As I mentioned below, there were a lot of unknown variables and bad decisions that contributed to such a disastrous result. Around 6pm a decision was made to do some LSD with a couple of my buddies, plans were put into motion and the proper phone calls were made, expecting to start the festivities around 8pm. The night started out like every Thursday at the frat house with heavy drinking. Evan Williams being the drink of choice for a poor fraternity man. One half gallon and 5 hours later, our mutual hippie friend finally shows up. We were a little frustrated and very intoxicated. This guy was known to have pretty weak doses, and even though the sheet we bought was overpriced, we still figured it was rubbish. So an 8th of a sheet of the most potent acid I'd ever done later, and one can imagine that I was out of my mind. I don't remember anything at this point, but I was told I was acting a little out of control. My friends kept me under control at the time, and locked me in my bunk around 3 am when I had calmed down enough to pass out. The alcohol no doubt had a dangerous impact on my consciousness, forcing my mind to black out at full RPM's tripping nuts. After a couple of hours I vaguely remembered ""awaking"" from my dream and entering a state of lucid dreaming, which happened to be a version of GTA: NCSU. I broke out of of the thin plywood encapsulating me, and proceeded to venture out into my ""dream world"" (but not before I smashed my laptop to smithereens.) I walked all over campus in the wee hours of Friday morning, crossing busy intersections with stopping or looking, and contemplating what my next move would be. I felt the sensation of wanting to drive a car more then anything, and this reoccurring thought led me to the parking deck on campus where students were arriving for their 8ams. I managed to find an open manual Jetta (after trying to open several cars in the lot.) I threw it into reverse, dropped the parking brake and coasted out of the spot, fully convinced that the car would drive if only I put enough thought into the situation. When the car stopped rolling. I had blocked the deck traffic. When a good samaritan left his idling truck to approach me and see if I needed help, I wandered over to his vehicle and hopped in. Driving the truck felt like the car was in hyperspace, I flew down a one way street and down a crowded campus road, over a four lane road, and then lost control and crashed into a utility pole. I was totally unharmed, the truck was destroyed, police were on the scene shortly after. I ditched when they arrived, purely in fight or flight mode, I sprinted down a neighbor street, and over a fence where I wound up in a briar patch with a police officer right behind me. He caught a hold of me and flung us both into the thorns, there was a struggle and eventually found myself atop of a badly cut up police officer, surrounded by thorns. It was terrifying. I was apprehended after I surrendered, and taken to the hospital and later jail where I stayed for 7 days, coming out of my daze the next day. I had to be put in isolation because I was actually freaking out the other inmates. Jail was horrible, the food was awful, I almost lost my mind. After getting my $260,000 bond reduced to $25k, I was released to an intense treatment center in North Carolina. After completing two months there I was transferred to a halfway house in Boca Raton, Florida for six months (also a terrible experience). My charges were reduced to 2 misdemeanors and a DWI. Currently I'm on probation, and work as as intern doing CAD modeling. I'm ready to start school in the Spring semester and have since stopped all substance use. 

Shit Happens. Like I said it's been one hell of a trip."
kvtoh,9,2011-09-29,The Path I'm Going Down...,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kvtoh/the_path_im_going_down/,"I don't really have anyone to talk to about things, and I guess I just want to write stuff down to organize my mind.  I posted here a couple months ago, but I guess things are different.  I deleted that post.  Hopefully with this one I'll even get some feedback.  My mind is so full of stuff, as I write this one paragraph may be completely different than the next.

The question I'm trying to answer for myself is, ""Am I doing this right?""

So all I want is to just settle down.  Find a comfy place for myself and do what I want to do where I don't really have to worry about finances. The only way feel I can get to that is to find a full-time job for myself, where I'm able to depend on nobody but myself.  And I really don't know how to get there.  If I can do what I love doing without bothering anyone else or giving someone else problems, I'd be so happy.

So right now, I'm sooooooo sooo lucky my parents are taking care of me still and providing me with a place to live.  If I didn't have them, I would probably be dead by now.  I'm 25, almost 26 now.  I really hate that I still live with my parents and that I have to be financially dependent on them.  I do have a part-time job, but it's not enough to live on my own.

The part-time job I have now is so crappy I hate it.  I work as a server in a family owned indo-chinese restaurant.  I get really low pay.  And the restaurant is understaffed.  That means I have to work front of house by myself on weeknights sometimes.  The restaurant itself is actually doing really bad.  We just don't get a lot of customers.  I kind of know why, and kind of don't.  The location is really bad for the business and the service sucks.  If there's 5 tables that all walk in at the same time, and one person working the floor (me), you're just straight up going to get bad service.  There's no way I can handle seating customers, taking phone calls, bringing out food, attending to whatever thing you need (asking for more napkins/sauce/utensils), all by myself when it's that busy.  I feel like I'm not getting paid enough for what I'm doing.  I don't get paid tip, which is a good thing, because sometimes the restaurant is empty.  An hour can pass by with nothing happening.  And the customers we get, Indian, Pakistani, Middle-eastern, just don't believe in tipping.  For example, 2 dollar tip off a 30 dollar meal or you can give them perfect service sometimes and get 3 dollars off a 40 dollar meal.  My manager just doesn't want to hire more people because it's not busy and she's afraid of hiring people without experience because she things all high-schoolers are lazy bums who just do drugs (as a result of a server that worked there before I started who always came to work high).  So basically I'm doing the work of 4 people.  (Host - seats people, Cashier - answer phone for takeout, Server - takes food orders/serves food, Busboy - cleans tables/packs takeout).  It's so frustrating how poorly managed it is that I just don't give a crap anymore how well the business does, even though it's managed and owned by family friends.  I put up with it because it's the only job I have.  And honestly, it's not worth it, because it's a 45 minute drive for 4-5 hours of work where half the paycheck goes to gas.  I should really find another job somewhere, but don't know where.  I applied to jobs more locally, but no responses at all.

I finished college 2 years ago with a degree in materials science engineering from a prestigious university.  I haven't had any promising job prospects at all.  My GPA out of college was garbage, so it closed some doors for me - something I regret deeply.  But I'm trying my best to find a job in that field. I just honestly don't know how to get one.  I've had two interviews out of all the job applications I've filled out.  I haven't heard any feedback from the second one, but the second one was just weird for me because my classmate I graduated with was one of the people interviewing me. It was like we didn't know each other at all because he’s had a job for 2 years while I’ve had nothing.  It was as if he was a different, more mature, person (he had bad grades in college as well but he did get internship experience while he was in college, which is something I failed to get).
So this semester, I went back to grad school part-time.  So that’s part-time job and part-time school.  Because after 2 years of not really doing anything related to my major, I feel like my college education was going to be a waste.  College was so expensive, that I’m not going to let it go to waste.  I'm currently in grad school, just taking a couple grad classes.  I'm just doing this for two reasons, because hopefully it shows job companies that I'm still trying to remember everything I learned in school, and also if literally nothing happens jobwise, I can set myself up for grad school, still have to take the GRE and apply to grad school.  Grad school is so damn expensive.  I honestly just want to work and get a livable income.  And going to grad school without experience is dumb, because I don’t even know what I want to go to grad school for.

I want to stay in the hometown I'm in right now, but there just aren't any jobs for me here.  Not in my engineering field, I think.  I really wish I thought my college major through more.  I kind of just went to college because all my classmates went to college out of high school.  I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life.  Well, I did have a plan, but I guess the path I took through college wasn't the right one to get to where I wanted to be.  Maybe it was a result of just bad advising or me not communicating what I wanted to do right to my advisors, or just not doing what I should’ve been doing.  I wanted to work for a medical device company, but the barrier for entry for those is just so high.  The reason why I wanted to was because my dad is a doctor, my mom is a nurse, and my older brother is about to finish his masters in respiratory therapy.  So that would’ve been cool.  I had quite a knack for putting things together from scratch by learning what each component did to make whole part, which is what got me into engineering.

I guess one of my personal problems is that I'm such an extremely shy person.  I'm so introverted and shy, it's really setting me back.  I've tried to break out of it, but it's so hard for me to ask for help.  I'm one of those people that would rather not do anything at all instead of put myself in a completely uncomfortable position.  I just die when I have to talk to someone else about something important.  Like if I had to call to ask about a job.  I just can't pick up the phone to do it.  I know it's setting me back too.  But I just honestly honestly need someone to hold my hand and make me feel comfortable when I make hard decisions or do things.  Or just plain straight tell me what to do, because I really don't know.  It's so terrible, I can't describe the feeling well.  I just literally have trouble talking and asking people for help.

So I guess I'm just depressed because I know where I want to be, but I have zero clue how to get there.  I’m surrounded by friends who have well paying full-time jobs at prestigious companies living by themselves and being able to afford whatever they want.  I know just having a full-time job won’t bring happiness, and I know despite those guys having a job, some of them aren’t happy because they don’t have time for the things they enjoy.  And I just don't know if what I'm doing is the right thing for myself.

If money weren’t an issue in life, I would just sit at home and read books all day.

To other people reading this, where I am right now might not seem so bad to them.  But it’s absolutely killing me.  I suffered severe bouts of depression in high school and college.  I think they're a result of me not know what to do with my life and committing to something.  They occurred both of my senior years, where I stayed at home depressed all day and missed class.  I did really poorly in high school because of it (I failed a class and missed my graduation with all my other classmates).  I dropped out of my senior year of college because I stayed at home depressed and was getting poor grades.  I also attempted suicide that year (which absolutely no one knows about) but I returned a year later to finish my degree.  I have zero suicidal thoughts now.  I think I ended up scaring myself to never try that again, it became something I never want to do again, hence no more suicidal thoughts.

I’ve been cutting out the things I enjoy one by one because I need to spend more time looking for a life-sustaining job and become independent of my parents.  One of my friends told me I’ve become a different completely person over the past 6 months.  I actually just straight cold stopped talking to a lot the people with whom I did hobbies with.  I simply just don’t enjoy doing the things I did before, and I find myself just sleeping a lot a lot instead thinking about what I can do to get a full-time job, which is making me even more depressed.  I realize it too, that if I cut out more of my hobbies and alienate more of my friends, then I’ll have nothing left.  But I want to feel like I’m doing something instead of sitting around at home looking like an unemployed lazy bum, but I don’t know what. If you've experienced depression, you just know that it feels like you have this dark cloud in your brain that makes it so hard to think and you're constantly tired.  I'm starting to feel that again.

That was a lot, I kind of let my mind flow freely and I guess that took 2-3 hours to write.  Tears started to flow out of my eyes as I was writing the paragraph about how shy/introverted I am.  Thanks for reading.  

I guess this is more of a cry for help than anything..."
kvfk0,9,2011-09-29,I can't even think right now,somerandomname000,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kvfk0/i_cant_even_think_right_now/,"Hey everyone, just a random throwaway account, just need to get all this out somewhere. I don't even know where to go with myself right now. So far all of 2011 has just been a constant spiral downward. I've been out of school since fall '09, shortly after got 2 part time jobs to get some money while searching for a full time job. November last year I quit one of the jobs so I could just have a more free schedule, just more time in the week, and more time to put into full time job hunting.

The next month my family found out that my dad had brain cancer. For the rest of december going into the end of January, we did what we had to do with surgerys and everything. Then at the end of Jan. my dad went in for a big surgery, one to try and remove as much of the tumor as they could get. They got a lot, but he wasn't waking up. For the next month, he wasn't exactly in a coma, but pretty close. But he was able to get up from that, literally the day they were thinking of pulling the plug. Following that we went through the necessary psychical therapy and all, he had to stay in a hospital for another month. But in March he was able to come home, he still needed help with pretty much everything, but he was home. That lasted until April 12, when he passed away in his sleep.

Been trying to just keep going from there. I ended up getting an internship in the field I'm trying to get into, animation, worked my ass off up until this month when they said the company was let go and all the work done didn't matter.

So here I am now, one very shitty part time job, almost completely out of money. Still not even a part time job in the area will hire me. That and some problems I've been having with this girl I like, and this weekend I'm leaving for Florida to spread my Dad's ashes at sea. All that gave me, what I assume to be, my first major anxiety attack this past weekend. I was shaking intensely, my face started feeling numb, and the scariest part was my hands pretty much locked up into fists, and I couldn't open them.

Back at the house, it used to be me, my mom and dad, my sister, my dog, and my grandparents. My sister moved out last year to her own place the next town over, my grandparents moved out to different houses, and apparently now they're not doing too great, and my mom has been working more. So lately most of the time it's just been me and my dog around the house. And now I find out this week that my dogs been pretty sick lately, can't eat anything without throwing up, etc. My mom made an appointment for her at the vet today, I'm trying to be as hopeful as I can, but she seems pretty convinced that it might be time.

If anyone does even read this, sorry about being all over the place with this post, I can't really think straight right now. I just don't know what do to right now"
kv7e7,3,2011-09-29,Am I just a fool?,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/kv7e7/am_i_just_a_fool/,"Preface:

I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years about 4 months ago. I met her as soon as I started college, while I was on a distance relationship with another girl. Shortly after I met her, I broke up with my by then high-school girlfriend, and was devastated for months (i.e suicidal thoughts, depression, unmotivated, etc). Throughout all this time, the girl that I had met, my last ex, became good friends with me. She always spent time consoling me, buying me food/groceries, making me smile, and so on. During the few next months, I had become, as an effect of the break-up, a much bitter and moody person than before. I had always been a very joyful and jittery person; I used to laugh with anyone about anything silly, always have a smile on my face, and always be optimistic about everything. That part of me had vanished. As time passed, I overcame my high-school ex overtime. I matured. I faced it, and grew up from it.

Now, here begins the real story. The girl, let's call her X, that had taken care of me all this time, turns out, was in love with me. I had been blind to this fact for so long, since I was so deep in my own depression and bitterness to actually realize it. I started opening myself little by little to her. Over time, I accepted the end of my previous relationship and allowed myself a chance at love again. Turns out, she was everything I wanted in a girl. Self-less, caring, happy, pragmatic, innocent, and so on. Of course, she wasn't perfect. She was very high-maintenance, got jealous whenever I would speak with another girl, and mean/bitchy when I needed personal space. I decided that the good out-weighted the bad, and decided to ignore it. 

Fast-forward a year later, and we've been best friends. Note, we haven't dated, but for what it's worth, by this point we had. The only thing we hadn't done was have sex. Then, by nature and feelings, we had sex. We were both virgins at the time. It was truly a beautiful moment. Shortly after, I decided to ask her to be my girlfriend, and she accepted. 

Fast-forward half a year, and things start to turn bad. Her jealousy sparks even brighter colors than before, even when absolutely nothing had happened between other girls and I. And, please understand, I have never, ever had the urge to cheat. Flirt? Sure, sometimes, but very, very limited, and nothing serious/intentional. She insisted we talked on the phone multiple times a day, and texting? Constantly, and if I didn't answer a single one within 3-5 minutes, she would send a second one with reprimand. I grew tired, as this was affecting my sleep, time management (I am an Engineering student, and I was already struggling with time management myself), and persona. I decided I needed a break from the relationship. 

That break lasted about a week. And during that break, she kept sending me occasional text messages. Nothing was accomplished with this. But, trying to weight the good over the bad, we get back together.

Fast-forward half a year. Our first year together had ended. I had lost the sparks in our relationship because of these same issues I had with her. I wasn't perfect either; I was still moody from time to time, I didn't laugh as much as when she had met me, and I was generally anti-social from time to time. Turns out, even though I had moved on from my previous relationship, I was still hurt. It hurt that I couldn't see a way to fix things in my current relationship. So, I broke up with her.

The summer following this, she had changed. A lot. She had lost that innocent side of her. She met friends that changed her a lot, and she started frequenting parties, getting drunk, and loving being the center of attention in hopes of her forgetting about me. I understood the motive, but not the methods. I felt genuinely sad. 

Turns out, she had made out with a few guys over this time. Had sex with one of them (she promises me she was given a lot to drink and she wasn't willing, but to this day she still talks with the guy with ONLY slight disdain, and are Facebook friends, etc, so I have reasons to not believe her on this), and had generally changed. But, I realized over the summer how much I missed her. I needed her back in my life, and I did not care what she had done or might have become. I needed her.

So, I basically beg to get back with her at the start of my junior year (last year). A month or so later, we are back together. I am extremely happy to be with her again, and so is she. However, I meet her new friends. They are nice people, but their life-styles don't exactly go hand in hand with mine. But, I give in and try her new interests. I try hard, but realize it's not exactly what I want in my life. Even so, I stick with her. She cares for me, the sex is great, and we can't leave each other alone.

...but as before, the same problems arise. And I discover day by day new sides of her. Turns out, this time, she really, really desired sex much more than before. We had several discussions about it, and she ends up admitting that she still feels insecure with me, i.e I might love another girl, etc. I assure her that this is not the case, but that I am afraid that she is not the person I once knew. 

Fast-forward last semester. She feels the need to break up with me right before summer, as she doesn't want a distance relationship, and the sex was too scarce for her (our current pace was 1-2 biweekly, she wanted more than once weekly, which in this case this may have been me at fault, perhaps not, I'll read you guy's comments). I am devastated. But I still try to understand. During the summer, she is in an internship. I talk with her almost daily. She sometimes comes back to campus (where I was taking a summer class) to hang out with friends and sometimes with me. 

Fast-forward to this semester... I feel she leads me on. She sleeps with me. We have sex. No compromise, though. She doesn't want to be together. A few weeks ago, I find out she's been seeing a guy. Dating? Maybe not. Fucking? Yes. How long had this happened before we were still having sex or spending a lot of time together? Not sure. 

Last weekend, she tells me it's official, they're going out. When did it become official? I'm not sure.

Reddit, I don't know. I don't know if I should hate her. Am I a fool for thinking there's still some hope in the future? She tells me there is. But that I shouldn't stop because of her. 

But even if I want to move on, it hurts me to see her. To talk with her. And what hurts the most is that to this day, she still takes care of me when I am sick, lonely, etc. It really makes it hard for me to hate her, because I love her. But the pain is too much.

Anyway, I have a class soon, so I have to cut this short. I will update this later, and if you managed to read this far, I'd love any advise or comment you may have on this. And, even if you don't..., well, I guess I feel better that I've been at least able to put these feelings into words. "

I have an interest in corporate finance, in particular IB. I'm a junior looking to land a summer internship. My major is mathematics with minors in computer science and finance. I don't start my finance courses until next semester, so I feel like my lack of financial knowledge is going to be a setback. But I feel like the purpose of an internship is to learn, so I'm not exactly too worried about that. I have a pretty solid resume and gpa as well.

For tomorrow's expo, what things should I be prepared to have with me or say to recruiters? I plan on going business casual and bringing 10 copies of my resume with me. "
kuyjr,4,2011-09-29,"I want you back, but you've moved on.",Police_Ataque,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/kuyjr/i_want_you_back_but_youve_moved_on/,"I know that in the past I have had trouble communicating with you.  I know that I’ve had trouble talking to you about problems I’ve had in our relationship and in my life.  So I want to have an open discussion with you about how I’m feeling, and what I want from my life.

I love you.  This is something that almost goes without saying at this point.  The profound effect you have had on my life in the time I have known you is beyond remarkable.  Being with you brought me joy that I didn’t know was possible, and confidence beyond anything I have ever known.  I’ve walked on flaming coals, jumped out of planes, won championships, and conquered fears.  None of these gave me even a fraction of the confidence I felt with you in my life.  Knowing you were there, feeling this same love that I felt for you, made me feel like nothing could break me, and nothing could stop me.  Seeing you smile, hearing you laugh, kissing you goodbye every morning before work, these were the reasons I loved you so much.  You have good heart, K.  The way you talk about your family and the way you cherish them makes me proud, in so many ways.  You would bend over backwards just to make them safe and happy.  In many ways, this was the love you offered to me.

Relationships are difficult to manage, in many ways.  I made many mistakes in the relationship, the first of which was my inability to prioritize you in my life.  I often think I can have it all in my life.  The loving girlfriend, the great friends, a successful career, a successful soccer season, and time to myself at the end of the day.  But there are only so many hours in the day.  And my hubris was too great.  I believed that I was smart and quick enough to only devote a little bit of time to each of these things on a given day, and still manage to tend to them all effectively.  But this was foolish.  Life is about sacrifices, especially when it comes to how we spend our time.  And what was sacrificed most was the time we spent together.  In my effort to maintain relationships with both you and with my friends, I often tried to combine the two pursuits, not realizing the toll this took on you, and the toll it took on our relationship.  We drifted apart, lacking time spent getting to know each other one-on-one.  Without that time, our lives diverged, and you resented me for it, and rightfully so.  I pushed you away foolishly, feeling as though you demanded too much of me.  And things spiraled from there.

As we drifted, I began to think of what the future should look like.  I wondered, only to myself, if perhaps I would have to continue on alone.  If I would have to move to Seattle, or DC, or San Diego, to discover my own path.  I didn’t know what to do.  And I felt as though I couldn’t talk to you without hurting you.  And in that moment, that lack of communication was my biggest mistake.  Every time we talked about our future, I was wracked with my own private battle.  I put off the decision continually, not knowing what I wanted or what I should do.  I wanted to talk to you, but I didn’t know how.  So I put it off, again and again.  I wanted a future with you, but I felt like I might be too young and foolish to commit to something in that moment.  At the time, I was right.

This crippling fear of change expanded into other areas.  I wanted to leave my job, but I didn’t know how.  I wanted to leave Tucson, but I didn’t know how.  I wanted to break free of my dad’s safety net, but I still didn’t know how.  I felt like a dumb kid who had been hit in the face with all of life’s choices at once without a clue of how to solve them.  I decided to avoid the problem.  One more summer couldn’t hurt, right?  One more summer of irresponsibility, coasting at an easy job while I played one last season of soccer before I inevitably had to leave.  I neglected to consider the fact that I would need to plan these decisions.  I hemorrhaged money, failing to plan for the possibility that soon we would be moving.  Failing to consider the costs of this expedition, and failing to consider the fact that you needed me to consider these costs in order to realistically plan our next step. What I was trying to do was run a marathon without having so much as jogged in the last couple of months.  I let my life decay, hoping that one day I could wake up and go, and everything would be fine.  You knew better, and you called upon me to help you plan the next step.  I was stubborn, and like everything else, I put it off, again and again.  I failed to face my problems and let them build up, until they became enormous.

So what?  At the end of all of this, why should you care?  You are more than aware of the problems we had, and why things fell apart.  It’s true, I’ve rehashed them more than a few times between then and now.

The point is, things have changed.  Or at least, they are changing.  That dead-end job is gone.  I am leaving Tucson, as are you.  I have a reasonably stable financial cushion to leave my life in Tucson, and start a new one elsewhere, as well as a few decent job prospects.  I have a bit more pain in my heart, which has only helped me develop strength and wisdom.  But more importantly I have perspective.  I recognize my mistakes.  They were the mistakes of youth, in my opinion.  I say this because I expect more of myself, as a man.  Becoming a man is a process, and in most cases a process requires a catalyst.  A process as monumental as this requires a strong catalyst.  And in my case, the catalyst was losing the girl I love.  That’s not to say that you left, and I immediately changed my act.  I looked for refuge in many places, trying to make myself happy with quick fixes.  None of it worked.  So I took a step back, and looked at my life, and asked myself why I had been unhappy for so long, and what I could do to fix it.  Why did I have trouble in relationships, and why did I always feel so helpless?  Through wise words from friends, family, and counselors alike, I discovered that the root of my problems came from the fact that I had trouble getting up and solving problems in my life.  I opted not to communicate with people when I had issues with them, I chose to spend extra money rather than planning efficient ways to solve problems, and I let myself settle for coasting in a job and a city that I wasn’t happy in.  And I recognized that many of these problems were identical to the root causes of our breakup.  So I resolved that the next thing to do was to start solving those problems.  The only thing to do to be happy, and to have healthy relationships (romantic, friendly, work, family, etc.) was to take responsibility for those issues, and grow up.  I had to work towards being a man, rather than a boy.  I didn’t have to give up my idealistic spirit or my naive view of the goodness of people, I just had to actively work to make myself a productive, functioning member of society as an adult, rather than a child.
I started throwing my resume to any appealing job that it would stick to.  And one of the places it landed with the biggest, most appealing splash, was San Diego.  This job provided more opportunities than I could think of.  First, it was a decent legal internship through a San Diego legend who could probably get my foot in the door with a number of other opportunities down the line.  Second, it was close to you.  And I think that second part appealed to me more than I was willing to admit, publicly or to myself.  It provided a second chance at a future I had squandered, and I got to thinking.  I started thinking about a realistic future with you again.  I started thinking about an apartment or a small house a short distance from the beach.  I started thinking about you and me, walking Jack along the boardwalk in the mornings and the evenings, about a small windowsill garden with a couple of big sunflowers posted on the window by the kitchen.  I started dreaming of a future together.  Maybe not the healthiest thing for a guy who had just broken up with you.  But I started thinking, nonetheless.

So here we are.  I don’t know how I will spend the next few years of my life, whether that will be in law school or grad school, or finding another job that makes me happy until I figure out the long-term plan.  There’s a lot of discovery between now and then.  What I do know right now is that I am a man-in-progress, a boy taking realistic steps to promote himself to adulthood.  In the time since I left Apple, I have saved up a small chunk of money for the transition, about $2000 to start a new life somewhere.  In my heart, I know how I would like to spend that money.  I would love to spend it relocating to California, just an hour from where you are, to start a new relationship with you.  And I’m not talking about “starting where we left off”.  Because where we left off didn’t work.  That’s why you left, and that’s why we’re here now.  I’m talking about a new relationship, built on open communication between two young adults who are discovering what it means to be newly adult, and who are ready to see what life without safety nets means. I want a relationship with realistic priorities, where I can manage my time with you set as my first priority, in line with the way I feel about you.  We’re not talking about massive character changes or personality shifts.  Because our good character and our caring personalities are what attracted us to each other in the first place.  We are talking about growing up.  And I have begun that process, and I intend to continue with it, regardless of what happens with us.  I hope that you will join me as I take the next steps to become the man I want to be, because I know that man is a strong one who will make you happy.  More importantly, I want to be there to see the woman you become.

This is how I feel.  This is what I want.  And more importantly, this is what I have to done to get there so far, and what I will do to get the rest of the way.  I hope you are there with me to see the end result, because frankly, I think it will be pretty awesome.

kuxkn,1,2011-09-29,"Saga of girl meets boy. advice, 2x? ",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/kuxkn/saga_of_girl_meets_boy_advice_2x/,"note: I'm a few glasses of wine in, pardon any typos. 

There is this guy. We met my freshman year of college (now we're both seniors) and we have had a very very long and dramatic history. 

Freshman year: I am dating (not officially) this guy from home (a rather fucked up, abusive relationship... details of which are not relevant here) but this guy (lets call him S) and I are hooking up. I start to develop feelings for S and finally break up with this asshole I was dating. 
S and I hook up, but he is clearly not wanting a relationship. I move on, date another guy. 

Sophmore year: I'm single. S and I are hanging out, not hooking up. I am at this moment struggling with an eating disorder, which S is the only one I have confided in. He convinces me to get the help I need. I realize he is honestly a good friend. 
Later in sophomore year, I meet a guy... we start dating. After a few months, we break up. 
S confides he has feeling for me. We begin to date 

Now it is summer after sophomore year. I am staying at school for an internship, S lives only 4 hours away. We are not official... he says he does not want to try a long distance relationship; is worried it might tear us apart. He repeatedly says that ""we are not official, you can do whatever you want."" 
That summer, I hookup with a friend of mine (not sex, just clarifying). 
I tell S about this. He gets mad. Says he doesn't know what to make of it. Wants a break. 
A few weeks later, S calls me. He has met someone. Some girl from home. Another few weeks later, they are dating. I am heartbroken. I only kissed my friend b/c I felt like I would seem to clingy to S if I did not heed his advice of ""do whatever you want."" 

Junior year: S is dating his gf from the summer (the long distance relationship he never wanted with me...) S and I are still hanging out, he starts to admit he has feelings for me. He says he wants to be with me but is afraid of me leaving (quite literally, I am leaving for NZ to study abroad for the spring semester). He and I end up hooking up numerous times (never sex, but everything but.) He still has a Gf. He promises me he is going to break up with her. He never does. 

I go to New Zealand (second semester junior year) and meet an amazing guy who treats me right, who never strayed and made me oh-so-happy. I no longer have feelings for S. NZ boy and I don't work out b/c I have to come back to the states, and we are at different stages in our lives. However, that does not denote what I felt for him while there. 

I am now back at school (my senior year) and S and I are hanging out. He one night tells me he is breaking up with his GF. I say likely story. He says, ""no, I want to be with you. I fucked up before. She is out of the country doing service right now but she comes back thursday (tomorrow) and I am breaking up with her.""

I told him that he would have to prove himself, earn my trust and earn the right to be with me. I am not about to give myself up to getting hurt again. Or end up doing something I regret (like being the other woman... I regret that so much. I was too wrapped up in my own emotions. I feel terrible about that) 
He said he will do whatever it takes. He seems different now, more open and honest.

We're close friends... but our friendship was never normal/platonic. It makes this more confusing. 

My close friends say to fuck him, that I deserve better. But I don't know. I think I will regret not giving him the chance to prove himself, to finally fight for me like he never did before. 
There is something about us, about him and me, we never stay apart for long. It has been 3 years of off and on... what if it is meant to be? 

What if it isn't? 
I'm just curious to hear strangers' opinions. People who don't know me. Everyone else is too close to the situation. 

Thanks for reading this saga.....so tell me, TwoX, what do you think? "
kuogh,1,2011-09-28,suggestions for joining the military,HalfJackson,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kuogh/suggestions_for_joining_the_military/,"I'm currently a junior in college; majoring in Computer Science; will be 21 within a month (Female, though it probably doesn't matter). I'm thinking about joining the Airforce, Navy, Coast Guard, or Air National Guard. My primary concerns are: I have another 2 years of college left before I can obtain my BS, and I would perfer to serve in the reserve (part-time) during that period. And,  I'd hope to postpone my BCT so I don't have to leave school for a quarter to train (It's OK if I cannot). I'm also thinking about getting a PHD in engineering and becoming a faculty at some later dates in life.

As for the reason I want to join. I think I'm too sheltered and not independent enough. The only real job I had was working in a deli during my highschool for a few months. My parents are super friendly, great relationship and  are willing to pay for all of my tuitions, but I really loath that idea. I think I will miss out a lot if I just march into the road that most sensible people will pick, which is get an intern, then get my BS, work for some firm while getting a phd, then become a faculty. I also have a strong desire to be competent and deciplined.

Personality wise,  I can be impulsive at times, and do not take orders well unless it can be justfied;   which I believe will be a challenge while serving. I do not have any depression problems, excise regularly and are decent at managing my time and school.

That being said, what are my best choice in gaining the most out of my tuition help? What job would be right for me? I'm interested in Cyberspace securtiy, high tech gadgets, programming(so not much debugging, but who does), blowing things up as long as I don't hurt anyone while doing so. I don't mind getting my hands dirty; like to fix things up; like to swim and travel around, A LOT."

kwi9g,4,2011-09-30,"So scared. My mind is all over the place. Overwhelming guilt and rumination, college plan/life feeling in shambles. Any kind words appreciated. ",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kwi9g/so_scared_my_mind_is_all_over_the_place/,"Reddit, I'm desperate. 

I'm a HS graduate of 2009. I had a 3.4 Honors Diploma, 2100 SATs, 33 ACTs, and I'm an Eagle Scout.  I played baseball basketball and football, and had the leads in the plays my junior and sr year. My dad had me playing baseball my entire life, and wanted me to play in college, but I finally put my foot down and told him i'd only been playing in all the travel teams and going to college showcases and such to appease him, as it was never a real passion of mine.  At the end of my high school career, I was still completely disillusioned by the realities of the real world. College was just ""the next step"", and my parents had been insisting forever that it's ""the only way to make anything of yourself"" ""get anywhere in life"" etc etc.

When I graduated HS, my house was completely dysfunctional. My sister has a severe eating disorder, was stealing all of the time, and my parents would get in huge fights with me about ANYTHING I did, even if I told them/got their permission. My gf of a year and a half cheated on me with a close friend of mine, and some random guy at a beach within a week of each other after 18 months of me sticking with her, even though we couldn't have sex because of vaginismus (which she refused to get checked out by a gyno...). At the time, I was in love with her, and it was soul crushing. It was also very weird for me because he was in my core social circle and all of my other friends kept hanging out with him.

My parents only let me apply to state schools and schools in Boston (since that's where my dad went to college). Like I said, I was completely disillusioned by the realities of the real world, and was never thinking of college as furthering my career, or gaining experience in a field that I would want to go into.  It was ""the next necessary step"".  To me, it was escape from my neurotic mother who has worked at home since I was in 5th grade and only gets out of the house to shop and get groceries (she has no social life) which kept any issues with my dad or her work in the home, which was very stressful.

When I applied to colleges, I didn't look at programs of study, or the classes that different degrees would require, or think about what I wanted to do or any of that. I know it's ""uncommon"" for undergraduates to ""know"" what they want to do until they're done with college, but that baffles me. I literally just applied to the schools in my state and the couple in Boston.

I got accepted at a school in Boston and went and did my freshman year there. No scholarships, but my parents have had the money set aside for college for a long time (I realize how fortunate I am), so I took them up on the offer for out of state, because I would have ""had to live at home"" for these other schools. I fell in love with a girl on my floor somehow while still aching from the pain of my cheating ex.  My parents insisted that I get a job up there as well, which I did, serving at a local music venue.  I did OKAY freshman year, well... not super.  I got C's and B's, a 2.6.  

Over the summer I talked my way into an internship at a defense contractor.  I got lucky too, my gf had an internship nearby, even though she was from way out of state. At the insistence of my father, when I went back to Boston the next semester, I decided to transfer into the business school and declare a business major. My life started to fall apart right around here.

I was diagnosed with MDD at 15 and had been on antidepressants until I graduated from HS.  At the end of HS I spoke with my psych and decided to wean off them to see if I could function without them.  I had brain zaps and was irritable the whole summer, but I chalked the irritability up to being irked about my gf and my parents. When I got to school I seemed okay, but there were times I got extremely anxious. I managed though.  I've never been one to drink, ever, but college drinking sucked me in, and my gf being a bit of a boozer didn't help.

So back to last fall. I was walking around feeling sort of out of it for a few days and wondering what was wrong with me. Then, looking in the mirror one morning, I noticed I looked really thin.  I'm 6'5"" and should weigh 200 at my lowest; I weighed 185.  Holy shit, I thought, I'm depressed. I called my pysch back home and talked with him, he said I was right and should start taking my medication again.

Here's where my life and mind got really turned upside down.  I started taking the medication again, and suddenly, I was horrified by what I was doing.  I realized I'd spent the last year and a half, and a TON of my parents money, working towards nothing in particular, barely ""learning"" anything even though I was passing classes, and not working in any way towards a career.  I felt like I was just there for the piece of paper that said ""I did it!"".  Not only that, but I began to feel like everything I was doing wasn't my choice.  Like my major, the schools I had applied to, etc.

I went home over thanksgiving break and told my parents I wanted to take some time off from the university and take classes at the local community college, in music theory and an instrument. They were a bit shocked I think, but supportive, at least in theory.  I remember being haunted for a couple weeks by a memory of asking my parents to take music lessons when I was younger, but being told we were already spending enough money on sports equipment.  

came home after the fall semester ended, excited to be saving them money and feeling like I was finally doing something for myself. It was a very hard decision as I'd be leaving my gf up in Boston and I had grown very attached to her.  

Back at home though, I started to think differently about her, very quickly.  I started thinking about how dependent on her I'd become, how I shouldn't have even met her in the first place since I didn't feel I should have picked that university just to get away from my family, and how I might not be going back, and how she would be going abroad next fall (this current semester), and how she was absolutely gorgeous, but a sorority girl and a drinker, and how much temptation there would be at her mixers with the frats, and encouragement from her sorority sisters to cheat (these aren't assumptions, I know a lot of these girls and they way they talk and treat their relationships... it's sad really).  So I broke up with her, citing ""too young to be in love"", ""not knowing where I'm going and not wanting to hold you back"", and the inevitable breakdown that would come with the distance and uncertainty of us seeing each other again.  I can't explain how soul crushing this was for me, every word made me second guess myself, but I kept saying it.

Couldn't hurt, anyway, since this is a throwaway.  It's not suicidal or anything, and I wouldn't call it full blown depression...  It's also not organized, just a random mish-mash of words as they came out of my head.  Some of the names, places, schools, etc. have been changed to give me reasonable deniability. Anyway...

My life-long dream was to go to Caltech.  More than anything else in the world, and it's been that way since a *very* early age, around 4.  Everyone labeled me as smart, even though I don't really **feel**
 smart.  I'm passionate, and I've got a bit of talent in a few areas (programming, math), and everyone's labeled me as some genius.  The fact that I somehow stumbled my way into the valedictorian seat at my high school didn't help.  The pressure to live up to that label has been overwhelming at times, but it also brewed in me a misplaced sense of confidence, an unwavering knowledge that I'd get into Caltech, because as all my friends said, ""if anyone deserves to get in, it's you.""  When I was rejected in 2009, it crushed me.  What crushed me more was that I had not applied to any other colleges.  I spent a year of my life essentially wasted, with the only thing to show for it the fact that I managed to save up $5,000 from my day job.  The depression I slipped into due to a failed internship opportunity, my rejection, my failure to get an IB certified diploma (instead I got a certificate of completion, which only counts as a regular diploma), a verbally abusive boss (old conservative car mechanic, they're like that.) I let another year slip by only applying to one college again, Caltech.  You don't need to tell me how ridiculously stupid that was.  I was rejected a second time.  I decided, however, that with my $5000, I'd move to Pasadena (from Boston), and learn to live as an adult.  And that's what I did in September of last year.  It was incredibly invigorating, empowering even, to take control of my own life, to pay my own bills.  I was still working a mind-numbing, pointless day job in retail (Caltech bookstore, so it was at least somewhat interesting), but I wasn't wasting away my year as a vegetable in between groggily dragging myself to work.  I finished NaNoWriMo, remarkable for me since I never finish ANYTHING I start on.  I started the ""Open Problem Society"", a group of people (really just me and my friend from work, but I know how to market things) who got together weekly and worked on unsolved problems, not for a grade, not even for success, just to enjoy math and it's frustrations as recreation.  It was a blast.  Admission decisions day rolls around again, and I'm rejected from Caltech for a third time.  It was crushing, but not nearly as bad this time, because I had applied to other schools this time.  I ended up going with the [Top 10 engineering school], and started here one month ago.

I've felt like an outsider ever since.

My age gap makes it hard for me to relate to people as well here, it's a thin plastic film separating me from everyone else.  No matter how much I surround myself with new friends, I'm always aware of that film.    I don't feel like I belong here.  I don't feel like I'm home, something that I felt at the Caltech campus like I had never felt anywhere else.  I feel like I've stepped into someone else's life, or I'm in some terribly cheesy film from the Syfy (not SciFi, I liked them.  They had to go and change their name) channel where someone for some poorly explained pseudophysics gets transplanted into a different universe from the multiverse: Everything is *almost* right, but not quite.

Nothing drove this home harder than tonight, however.  A few days ago was the birthday of one of my new college friends.  We all hung out until midnight, and everyone sang him happy birthday right at midnight.  His best friends from back home called and wished him a happy birthday right at midnight.  Everyone made a generally big deal about it.  Tonight (today, I guess), was my 21st birthday (I don't drink, so no, I won't go drink away my sadness).  I got no phone call (first time in 8 years), and the group of people I was with didn't even notice, nor did they notice when 15 minutes later when I quietly let myself out of their room and went back to my room to spend the next half hour or so crying.  It's not as if I was sulking in the shadows, I was conversing with them, while they were playing cards.  Had one friend (birthday boy from a few nights ago) look over my shoulder while I checked my phone to see what time it was, see that it was 00:05, and declare that he had an 8 o'clock class, so he was going to go to bed.

This seems a terribly pitiful and childish thing to get upset over.  I'm the 21 year old, I'm supposed to be the mature one who doesn't give a shit about all this high school whining, yet it's still got me so upset, and the fact that it's such a silly thing is making it even worse.  I dunno if anyone is going to be able to say anything I haven't already told myself, but I guess it helped to just type it all out.  I'm no longer sobbing anyway.

**TL;DR:** Meh, It wasn't that important anyway, carry on with your day."
kw12g,5,2011-09-29,Any younger geeks looking for a paid internship at a start-up company?,duffmanhb,vegas,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/kw12g/any_younger_geeks_looking_for_a_paid_internship/,"Hey, guys I've been to enough meetups to know this is probably the first place I should look for what we need hahaha

We just lost our last intern to Germany recently. Apparently he had to go back to school and no one managed to plan ahead and try and rehire. He was a 20 year old German dude who also used Reddit, so I figured Reddit is the key to the best of the worst out there hahah...

What I need? Some one that knows computer science and can do some coding. Nothing too intense, but just to maintain the already completed software backbone and make some slight changes every now and then. Also some one that is analytical that has no problem gathering data from the system and running it to figure out some problems. It's not very difficult but can be a lot of fun. You would also probably be making a lot of Skype calls with our San Fran office to help them out and come up with new ideas. No dress code, just don't be a douchebag haha

For the job, the pay is not bad. 

Also, it's freakin' stellar experience. We are a start up that just got a massive investment (90 million) recently so things are constantly changing. Roles are being reassigned on a weekly basis because we are expanding so fast. Next week we move into our THIRD office which is even bigger than the last. Mind you, the first office just opened up 1.5months ago and is poised to be the main US office, which is critical. To say you worked with a start-up from it's very early days that ended up exploding into a well known company is a resume monster.

The company is called Wimdu, it just started about 7 months ago. The idea was to be the AirBnB of Europe, which has happened in an extremely short time. Now we just entered the US market after the investment we received and are set to do some real damage to our competitor. 
  
So yeah, if you think you can fill this position either part time or full time (Preferably full time, but we can do part time) don't send me a resume. Send me a little about yourself, an interesting fact, and some sort of evidence that shows you are a fellow geek and can do what's needed. You could start as early as next week...

P.S. I'm Chad from some of the meetups if you remember me. I'm about 24 and can drink my weight in alcohol if that rings any bells for any one. Also, if you're from UNLV, that's a plus, because I am biased like that.  "
